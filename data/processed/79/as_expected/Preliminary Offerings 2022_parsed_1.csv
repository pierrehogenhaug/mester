Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations, intentions or forecasts of future events as at the date of such statements or information. We caution you that the assumptions used in the preparation of such information may prove to be incorrect. Forward-looking statements include statements about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical fact. In some cases, words or phrases such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those expected in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in “Risk Factors.” In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from those referenced in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: - the ongoing COVID-19 public health pandemic; - the level of competition in the hip joint implant market for us and our key customers and intense competitive pressures in the Industrials markets; - our reliance on a limited number of large medical customers; - our dependence on the image and reputation of our BIOLOX[®] products; - our ability to retain and attract new customers; - the impact of changes on regulations application to our manufacturing processes and facilities and our key medical customers; - failure by our customers to obtain or maintain governmental approvals or clearances that enable them to sell our products; - adverse medical events, the discovery of serious safety issues or any recalls that could impact our products or image; - the impact of inadequate coverage and reimbursement policies or changes in health care reimbursement systems; - liability for damages arising out of product liability claims; - the impact of global economic conditions and the political climate, in particular, in Germany and Europe, such as uncertainty surrounding Brexit or changes to the composition of the Eurozone, and conditions in the end-markets we serve; - the successful innovation and introduction of our new products; - exposure to local business risks in different countries; - price increases or interruptions in the supply of raw materials, including as a result of increased shipping costs, any failure to renew agreements with material suppliers and fluctuations in energy costs; - unforeseen business interruptions and other operational problems at our production facilities; - inadequate insurance coverage, or increased insurance costs; - our ability to maintain efficiency and manufacturing quality; -vii ----- - risks related to changes to, and compliance with, laws and regulations, including extensive environmental, health and safety laws, anti-corruption laws of the European Union, the United States and various other jurisdictions, anti-terrorism laws and regulations, applicable trade embargoes and export controls; - any requirement to repay public subsidies or grants as a result of a failure to meet specified conditions; - our ability to protect our intellectual property and know-how; - the risks of litigation, lawsuits for infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties and other claims; - our dependence on good relationships with our employees and employee representative bodies and any inability to recruit and retain key personnel, including qualified scientific, technical and sales employees; - any defects from the outsourcing certain productions steps and counterparty risk; - failure of our risk management policies to mitigate our risk exposure; - risks related to security threats, security breaches or breakdowns in our information technology systems, and to the handling of personal data; - failure to realize the anticipate benefit of acquisitions or identify suitable acquisition targets to implement our growth strategy; - risks related to our pension plans; - tax-related risks; - exchange rate fluctuations; - climate change and related regulatory responses; - risks related to the Transactions, our capital structure, our indebtedness and the Notes; and - other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.” These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity and developments in the markets and industries in which we operate. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We urge you to read this entire offering memorandum, including the sections entitled, “Risk Factors”, “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Industry” and “Business” for a more complete_ discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the industry in which we operate. Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this offering memorandum, and we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set out in this offering memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this offering memorandum.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers accepts responsibility for the factual correctness of any such statistics or information obtained from third parties. Certain market and industry data included in this offering memorandum, including the size of certain markets, are based on estimates of management and commissioned reports, including a report from a leading international consultancy firm. These estimates have been derived from management’s knowledge and experience in the markets in which we operate, as well as information obtained from commissioned reports and from our customers, distributors, suppliers, trade and business organizations and other contacts in the markets in which we operate. We also provide certain estimates of the growth of markets and certain other projections related to our business. This information is inherently speculative and subject to risk. Because such data is often incomplete, multiple sources are typically triangulated to develop consensus estimates. Market data and statistics, including information regarding penetration rates and growth, volume and growth and other information about particular regions or markets, are inherently predictive and speculative and are not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are generally based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents. In addition, the value of comparisons of statistics of different markets is typically limited by many factors, including that (i) the underlying information was gathered by different methods with varying levels of access and information available in different markets and (ii) different assumptions were applied in compiling the data. Market studies are frequently based on information and assumptions that may not be exact and their methodology is by their nature forward-looking and speculative. Accordingly, the market statistics included in this offering memorandum should be viewed with caution and no representation or warranty is given by any person, including us and the Initial Purchasers, as to their accuracy. We believe that the sources of such information in this offering memorandum are reliable, but there can be no assurance that any of these assumptions are accurate or correctly reflects our position in our industry, and none of our internal surveys or information has been verified by any independent sources. Furthermore, certain forward-looking statements contained in such industry and certain market data may not fully include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other related developments, including the impacts of future national or local lockdowns or other measures implemented by national and/or local authorities. There can be no assurance that such forward-looking statements would not have been materially different if such developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic had been taken into account. See “Forward-looking Statements.” Further, please be aware that data and statistical information in this offering memorandum, may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from information found in current or future studies conducted by market research institutes, consultancy firms or independent sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, such data involves risks, assumptions and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors.”",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

The actual figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 presented in this offering memorandum have been extracted without adjustment from the comparative column in the 2019 Audited Financial Statements. The Audited Financial Statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Friedrichstraße 14, 70174 Stuttgart, Germany, a member of the German Chamber of Public Accountants (Wirtschaftsprüferkammer), Berlin (“PwC”), independent auditors, who issued independent unqualified auditor’s reports thereon.

79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.2,Historical Financial Information,4.2.2,Comparability of the Financial Statements,"_The Acquisition of CeramTec Holding GmbH in 2018_ On March 8, 2018, a consortium led by funds advised by leading private equity firm BC Partners, including The Public Sector Pension Investment Board and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan acquired CeramTec Holding GmbH (“CeramTec Holding”) and its subsidiaries from its former owner, Cinven. In connection with this acquisition, CeramTec AcquiCo GmbH (in the following “CeramTec AcquiCo”) acquired all of the shares in CeramTec Holding. CeramTec AcquiCo is a 100% subsidiary of CeramTec BondCo GmbH (“CeramTec BondCo”), which is a 100% subsidiary of the Target. The Target indirectly obtained control of the operating group’s business as from the acquisition date. As a result, the Target’s statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows information for the year ended December 31, 2018 include (i) approximately two months of operations of the Target, CeramTec BondCo and CeramTec AcquiCo only, without any results from the operational business activities of the Target Group, and (ii) approximately ten months of operations of the Target, including CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries from time to time. Given the impact of the acquisition of CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries, the statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 are not directly comparable to the statement of comprehensive income or consolidated statement of cash flows for any subsequent period. Consequently, for the benefit of readers and in order to aid comparability, certain pro forma statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows information, including revenue, operating income, amortization, depreciation and impairment charges on non-current assets, EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA margin, Capital Expenditures, Cash Generation, Cash Conversion Ratio, is provided in order to compare the performance of operations including operating advanced ceramics business for the entire period. The unaudited pro forma statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows information for the year ended December 31, 2018 is based on and derived from a pro forma aggregation of two analysis periods for the two different ultimate parents, to enable a consistent view of the operating entities in the consolidated group: (i) for the period January 1, 2018 to February 28, 2018 for the consolidated group of the former ultimate parent CeramTec Holding GmbH; and (ii) for the period March 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 for consolidated Target Group. Such unaudited pro forma statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows information of the Target for the year ended December 31, 2018 is presented in this offering memorandum for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered indicative of the actual results that would have been achieved had the acquisition of CeramTec Holding been completed January 1, 2018. Such unaudited pro forma statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting unaudited pro forma statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. The unaudited pro forma statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows information should be read in conjunction with the information included elsewhere in this offering memorandum under the captions “Summary Historical Financial and Other _Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Financial_ Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. _The Acquisition of Dentalpoint AG_ On January 4, 2021, we acquired Dentalpoint AG, a corporation based in Spreitenbach, Switzerland, supporting our investment in the fast-growing future market for ceramic dental implants and further expanding our Medical product offering. The preliminary purchase price of €51.0 million was paid using cash and cash equivalents, while, following a reduction agreed in September 2021, the final purchase price equaled €49.9 million as a result of post-closing adjustments (or €49.0 million, net of cash and cash equivalents taken over). As a result, our consolidated financial information may not be comparable following the date of such acquisition. See note 1.3 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements for further information. _Changes in Accounting Standards._ The Target adopted IFRS 16 (Accounting for Leases) on January 1, 2019. In accordance with IFRS 16, the lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset (or “RoU asset”) and a corresponding lease liability for all leases. At the commencement date, the amount of the RoU asset corresponds to the amount of the lease liability. In the subsequent periods, the RoU asset is (apart from some exceptions) measured at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The net carrying amount of the right-of-use assets amounted to €4.1 million as of December 31, 2019 whereas the corresponding lease liabilities to the right-of-use assets amounted to €4.2 million as of December 31, 2019. The expenses from the right-of-use assets and the lease liabilities in accordance with IFRS 16 were €2.5 million depreciation and €0.2 million interest expenses for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2019, payments for capitalized leases were made in an amount of €2.7 million and €2.9 million, respectively. Finance leases capitalized in prior years according to IAS 17 were included in the statement of -xv ----- financial position as of December 31, 2019 in an amount of €1.2 million net carrying value in property, plant and equipment and €1.2 million in the lease liabilities. See note 4.14 to each of the Audited Financial Statements for further information on the adoption of IFRS 16. No other changes to accounting standards and no announced but not-yet-adopted accounting standards had, or are expect to have, a significant impact on the Target Group during the periods included in this offering memorandum. See note 2.4 to each of the Audited Financial Statements for further information. _Impact of COVID-19_ The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations limits the comparability of our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2020 with the relevant corresponding period in 2019, and may impact comparability with future periods. See “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—The COVID-19 _Pandemic” and “Summary—Recent Developments—COVID-19 Update.” The Transactions_ None of the financial information in this offering memorandum has been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the statement of comprehensive income, statement of financial position and consolidated statement of cash flows that might occur as a result of the Acquisition. We will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS. Only certain limited as adjusted financial data of the Issuer is presented to give pro forma effect to the Transactions, including the Offering. See “—As Adjusted Financial Information” below and “Capitalization.” Under IFRS 3 (Business Combinations), the consideration transferred in an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred by the acquirer on the date of the acquisition, any liabilities incurred by the acquirer to the former owners of the target and any equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except for deferred costs related to the acquisition of debt or equity securities. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of non-controlling interests in the target over the identifiable net assets on the acquisition date is recorded as goodwill. The application of the acquisition method is likely to result in different carrying values for existing assets and new assets may be added to the Target’s statement of financial position, which may result in different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future consolidated financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the Target’s consolidated financial statements included in this offering memorandum. In the future, we may report our consolidated financial condition and results of operations at the level of another entity in the holding structure. In accordance with IFRS, we have a measurement period of up to twelve months from the acquisition date to finalize the allocation of the purchase price. Due to these and other potential adjustments, future financial statements for the Group could be materially different and may not be comparable to our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The primary non-IFRS financial measures used in this offering memorandum include Capital Expenditures, Cash Generation, Cash Conversion Ratio, EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Cost of sales, Adjusted Gross profit, Adjusted Selling costs, Adjusted Research and development costs, Adjusted General administrative costs and Adjusted Other income and expenses, net, certain leverage and coverage ratios and other figures (the “Non-IFRS Measures”). Each of the EBITDA-based and net income-based measures presented in this offering memorandum is defined and calculated differently from the definition of “Consolidated Net Income” and “Consolidated EBITDA” presented in the Indenture. Our primary Non-IFRS Measures are as follows: - “Capital Expenditures” is defined as the sum of additions to intangible assets and additions to property, plant & equipment (excluding right-of-use assets); - “Cash Generation” is defined as Management Adjusted EBITDA minus Capital Expenditures; - “Cash Conversion Ratio” is defined as (i) Management Adjusted EBITDA minus Capital Expenditures, divided by (ii) Management Adjusted EBITDA; - “EBITDA” is defined as net profit for the period before taxes on income, financial result and depreciation and amortization; - “Management Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA before certain costs and expenses which our management considers exceptional or non-recurring, such as restructuring costs, foreign exchange conversion effects that are accounted for in our operating income, additional contributions to pensions, certain acquisition and transaction-related costs, purchase price accounting on inventories, start-up losses, discontinued operations and certain other non-recurring items; - “Management Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is defined as the ratio of Management Adjusted EBITDA to revenue: - “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Management Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for certain adjustments and expected cost savings identified by us and the Sponsors as described under “Summary—Summary _Financial and Other Data—Other Financial and Operating Information”;_ - “Adjusted Cost of sales”, “Adjusted Gross profit”, “Adjusted Selling costs”, “Adjusted Research and development costs”, “Adjusted General administrative costs” and “Adjusted Other income and expenses, net” are defined as Cost of sales, Gross profit, Selling costs, Research and development costs, General administrative costs and Other income and expenses, net, respectively, adjusted for depreciation and amortization and certain costs and expenses which our management considers exceptional or non-recurring; and - “Adjusted Gross profit margin” is defined as the ratio of Adjusted Gross profit to revenue. For a detailed reconciliation of these measures to the closest comparable IFRS measure, see “Summary—Summary _Financial and Other Data—Other Financial and Operating Information.”_ By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, historical cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we believe Capital Expenditures, Cash Generation, Cash Conversion Ratio, EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Cost of sales, Adjusted Gross profit, Adjusted Selling costs, Adjusted Research and development costs, Adjusted General administrative costs and -xvii ----- Adjusted Other income and expenses, net, can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. We believe a presentation of Capital Expenditures and Cash Conversion Ratio is useful to investors to assess our liquidity. These Non-IFRS Measures are presented in this offering memorandum because they are measures our management used to assess operating performance, because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and financing structure, and because we believe they present helpful comparisons of financial performance between periods by excluding the distorting effect of certain non-recurring items. Our Non-IFRS Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Our Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Some of the limitations of Non-IFRS Measures are that: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statement of comprehensive income; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating certain EBITDA-based Non-IFRS Measures reflect cash payments that were made, or will be made in the future: - they may be illustrative in nature and do not reflect an actual period of historical performance: and - other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the Financial Statements and using these Non-IFRS Measures only to supplement evaluation of our performance.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,Medical Markets,"We develop and manufacture advanced ceramics, which are designed to perform their functions in critical medical applications, including hip replacements, other orthopedic implants and dental implants to serve Medical markets. In these markets, we primarily focus on ceramic components for hip joint prostheses, such as ball heads and cup inserts used in hip replacement procedures. We believe that practitioners recognize our HPC components for medical implants, namely in hips, as a superior solution with proven benefits versus other materials such as metal alloys of cobalt and chrome. As a result, ceramic materials are replacing traditional materials for hip joint prosthetic components such as metal which have documented safety concerns -1 ----- and can trigger physical reactions in patients including, for example, allergic reactions resulting from metal sensitivity. In particular, HPC components are not only highly biocompatible, but also extremely wear resistant and durable and thus, have the ability to improve patients’ lives through appropriate immunological response, corrosion resistance, infection prevention, lowest wear of all bearings and best clinical outcomes. Consequently, ceramics penetration in global medical implant markets is steadily rising leading to increased growth for our ceramic components. More than 20 million of our BIOLOX[®] ceramic components have been implanted in patients globally as of the date of this offering memorandum. We estimate that nearly one in two hip joint implant systems sold worldwide includes at least one ceramic component. Our customers are orthopedic implant OEMs, including the top orthopedic implant OEMs who together have a strong presence in the global hip implant market. We believe that our BIOLOX[®] brand has come to symbolize high quality and innovation and is increasingly preferred by surgeons and other medical professionals. We believe that in the future, the superior characteristics of ceramic materials will drive the rapidly growing market for dental implants, in which we have been active for many years and are further ramping up our presence with our DENSILOX[®] and ZERAMEX[®] brands. The penetration of ceramics in the dental implants market is rapidly increasing from a low starting point (according to a leading international consultancy firm, the ceramic share in the dental implant market in the US and EU-5 was equal to 7% in 2019) as patients not only become more focused on aesthetics and biocompatible implants, but also as new product innovations have closed the gap with titanium implants in terms of product quality, primarily relating to wearability and longevity. Since 2020, our HPC solutions have been used for spine disc implants and, over the coming years, we expect to bring our BIOLOX[®] technology to more orthopedic applications, such as implants for knee and shoulder.

79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,A high growth med-tech platform with defensible industry leading position,"We are the innovation leader of ceramic components for medical implants, addressing a €8.1 billion market based on global sales in 2019, according to a leading international consultancy firm. The global addressable orthopedics implant market, consisting of hip, spine, knee and shoulder and veterinarian orthopedic implants, amounted to €3.5 billion in 2019, and its growth is driven by an aging population, increasing life expectancy, increasing prevalence of overweight and chronic diseases, increasing access to healthcare, favorable demographics factors and increasing number of pet owners (for veterinarian implants), among others. Further, global growth in the hip total addressable market by volume of hip implant surgeries is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% from 2022 to 2026. We believe practitioners recognize our high performance ceramic components for medical implants as a superior solution with proven benefits and a superior clinical record as compared to other materials such as metal alloys of cobalt and chrome. As a result, ceramics penetration in global medical implant markets is steadily rising, leading to increased growth for our ceramic components. For example, in hip implants, the ceramic volume share of hip ball heads is expected to increase from approximately 47% in 2019 to approximately 58% in 2026, with a longer-term penetration potential of 100% and increasing penetration by 18% from 2016 to 2026, according to a leading international consultancy firm. The global addressable dental implant market is estimated to amount to €4.6 billion in 2019 and to grow at a CAGR of approximately 6% between 2022 and 2026 driven by an aging population, higher disposable income and increased aesthetic consciousness, with ceramic dental implant EU-5 and US markets growing at a CAGR of approximately 10% for the same period, according to a leading international consultancy firm, driven by an aging population, higher disposable income, and increasing awareness of dental aesthetics. The volume share of ceramic dental implants for the EU-5 and US dental implant fixtures and abutments is expected to grow from a mere 4% in -2 ----- 2019 to 6% in 2026, with a mid-term ambitious penetration potential of 20% to 25% in the US and 20% to 30% in EU-5, according to a leading international consultancy firm.

OEMs typically prefer suppliers with capacity to increase volumes, react flexibly to volume changes and sign longer-term contracts. We are also able to manage costs through our strong supplier base built up over a number of years. We believe our customers are highly loyal as we have a strong reputation with surgeons and care providers. In addition, our ceramic hip components represent only a small portion of the total price of an implant system for an OEM, typically comprising less than 10% of the overall cost, but are critical to the performance of these products. As a result, customers tend to be less sensitive to the cost of these components and primarily focused on quality. Ceramic hip components also have a high potential of being more cost-efficient over the course of their lifecycle than metal components due to their durability (regardless of the patient’s age) and other safety concerns. In addition, responsibility to bring a new device to the market typically lies with the OEM, as the marketing authorization is granted not for the component but for an entire hip implant system. This process requires substantial financial efforts and time since obtaining marketing authorization from regulators can take 18 months or longer for ceramic-on-polyethylene products or up to six years for ceramic-on-ceramic products across geographies. Therefore, replacing one part in a hip implant system could require new or additional regulatory authorizations or delay the regulatory review process, which incentivizes customers to use an established and proven product like ours. We also maintain a regulatory and quality team of over 50 people as of September 30, 2021, in an effort to ensure a -3 ----- smooth process and efficient assistance both to our customers and to our internal organization. Given the associated liability risks for OEMs in relation to any quality issues, we believe that OEMs prefer our well-trusted BIOLOX[®] brand to others. We actively engage in promoting our brand among key opinion leaders in the medical industry, including surgeons and hospitals by regularly organizing technical training sessions and attending medical seminars on clinical outcomes and material properties of ceramics. We believe BIOLOX[®] is a globally recognized brand in hip implant solutions among surgeons and considered the industry “gold-standard” for hip replacement procedures.

For spines, we developed and launched on the market the ceramic core for the Simplify[®] Disc implant in cooperation with Simplify Medical in 2020, and have received FDA approvals for use in certain 1-level implants in 2020, and approval for use in certain 2-level implants in 2021. The global market for artificial spinal disc implants is projected to grow by approximately 9.5% per year between 2022 and 2026, according to a leading international consultancy firm. Ceramic components are expected to reach up to 10% market share by 2026, according to a leading international consultancy firm, driven by clinical benefits of the Simplify[®] Disc solution with our ceramic core over comparable cervical disc implants due to its slim design, MRI compatibility, use of biocompatible materials and unique articulation designed to restore natural motion, together with the strong marketing capability of NuVasive, a large spine-focused OEM that acquired Simplify Medical in 2021. We also view ceramic knee implants as a logical next step for us, given the similar market dynamics and success factors when compared to hip implants. The market for knee implants was €1.6 billion in 2019 and expected to grow at approximately 4% per year between 2022 and 2026, according to a leading international consultancy firm. While virtually all current replacement implants are made of metal alloys, we expect that similar issues as with hips, such as wear, infections, allergic reactions and ultimately, removal surgeries, are likely to provide a significant market opportunity for ceramic implants. We believe the opportunity for a new generation BIOLOX[®] knee is particularly attractive due to the anticipated significant ceramic penetration in combination with our existing orthopedic expertise and brand awareness amongst OEMs and end-users. Our new BIOLOX[®] delta knee implants are currently in the design phase, and we expect clinical trials to commence in 2023 and go-to-market in the United States in 2027. In addition, ceramic shoulder implants and other orthopedic solutions for extremities present further attractive adjacencies for growth that we will explore in the medium- to long-term. The global market for shoulder implants amounted to €212 million in 2019 and is projected to grow by approximately 7% between 2022 and 2026, according to a leading international consultancy firm. The market currently comprises almost 100% metal implants, with two challenger OEMs providing insignificant volumes of ceramic components. However, we expect that ceramic shoulder implants could comprise up to approximately 10% of the shoulder implant market in the medium term and up to 50% in the longer-term, primarily due to the superiority of ceramic shoulders compared to metal, further driven by surgeons, who would specifically recommend a ceramic shoulder implant for patients who are hypersensitive, young or undergoing total shoulder replacements. We have designed a new ceramic shoulder head to be used for both anatomic as well as reverse shoulders. We currently have an agreement with one OEM in place that will shortly start clinical trials to gain market approval and another OEM that has the design on hand.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

We have implemented a corporate social responsibility policy (the “CSR Policy”) that supports our aim to achieve profitable, global growth, conserve energy and protect natural resources. In addition, we recently appointed an ESG manager, and are in the process of setting long-term ESG targets and strategy. We aim to achieve sustained, profitable growth for continued successful business development characterized by responsible business practices and integrity. We are committed to making the world a greener place by keeping our ecological footprint as small as possible by conducting environmentally-friendly, professional and safe operations. This includes conserving scarce resources such as raw materials, energy and water as well as avoiding and reducing carbon dioxide emissions and waste. For example, we have reduced our carbon dioxide emissions per euro of revenue since 2017. Our fair, ethical and environmentally-friendly approach incorporates everything from the management of our company and the manufacturing of our products to the procurement of resources and even our investments in buildings and facilities. Furthermore, developing products made from advanced ceramics reflects our sense of responsibility when it comes to the future. We create sustainable solutions that are used worldwide in a variety of industries and fields of application. They improve quality of life, increase efficiency, enhance productivity, save energy and protect the environment all while supporting our customers in reaching their own sustainability targets. We consistently implement our basic principles of sustainable, responsible business management. Our efforts clearly pay off by conserving energy and protecting the environment and our natural resources. For example, we implemented an energy management system (DIN ISO EN 50001 certified) which focuses on increasing energy efficiency and sustainably reducing energy consumption across our facilities and production processes. In addition, we implemented a DIN ISO 14001 certified environmental management system, which assists in the promotion of environmental protection, the prevention of pollution and the application of environmentally-sensitive approaches in our manufacturing and procurement processes. Our approach to sustainability is also reflected in our social commitment to people in the community and our employees, as can be seen in our training programs, equal opportunities, focus on sustainable development and growth and health and safety.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.16,Our Response to COVID-19,9.16.1,,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on economic activity across our markets and on our business in 2020 and the beginning of 2021. We experienced decreased volumes as non-essential surgeries were postponed and customers had to cancel orders or shift delivery dates given the lower demand from clinics, which negatively impacted our revenue. Performance in Industrials markets has been impacted by the global industrial down-cycle since 2019 that was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We experienced a 22.8% decrease in revenue from the first quarter -12 ----- of 2020 to the second quarter of 2020. During 2020, however, revenues in our medical equipment markets were supported by a spike in market growth for our ceramic formers used in manufacturing disposable medical gloves and by sales of components for COVID-19 test kits in the second half of 2020. Overall, we experienced a decrease in revenue of 10.9% in 2020 as compared to 2019. Despite the revenue decline, our cash flow from operating activities was €163.4 million in 2020, as compared to €190.1 million in 2019. We also experienced COVID-19 related involuntary plant closures, which negatively impacted revenue and EBITDA during 2020. Our factories in Malaysia were required to shut down in March and April of 2020, and again in July 2021, following general government directives. Our factory in China also had to close for two weeks at the beginning of February 2020, which negatively impacted sales. In India, lockdowns in March and April 2020 that extended to mid-May 2020 in some regions and subsequent production slowdowns negatively impacted our business until August 2020, and again in July 2021. We also experienced a slowdown at most of our facilities as a result of delays in orders from our customers. For example, one of our subsidiaries operating in mobility end-markets, Emil Müller Group, has had to slow production following shutdowns at its major customer due to lack of raw materials and other components, which negatively impacted revenue. As of the date of this offering memorandum, all of our factories have reopened. Our EBITDA margins remained resilient throughout the period as we continued to implement various cost optimization measures. We started numerous initiatives in February 2019 to streamline our organization and focus on an Industrials market-based approach, with the aim of reducing organizational complexity and overhead costs. In addition, following the outbreak of COVID-19, we deployed further cost reduction measures including multiple employee lay-offs, and the decrease or postponement of investing outflows and capital expenditures with regard to non-essential projects. We also used short-time work (Kurzarbeit) measures and short-time work compensation (Kurzarbeitergeld) from the German government’s employment agency (KUG), which compensated employees for a reduction in working hours as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, for certain periods in 2020 and to a lower degree in 2021, which significantly reduced our costs per fulltime-equivalent employee in 2020. We expect that costs will increase in 2021, partially due to the reduction of short-time work benefits. We also deferred UK VAT due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We received government support of €1.1 million mainly comprised of short-time work related social security contributions in 2020. Since the third quarter of 2020, we have begun to experience pre-pandemic rates of growth. Our revenue in the first quarter of 2021 were approximately 2% higher than in the first quarter of 2019 and approximately 5% higher in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2019. Year-to-date trading is benefitting from post-COVID-19 tailwinds as the result of key customers restocking and increasing orders following postponements and cancellations in 2020. The strong performance in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflects surgery volumes recovering to pre-pandemic levels in most regions and further strong ceramic penetration momentum. We still remain vulnerable to further lockdowns and COVID-19-induced adverse events in the short-term, which could result in increasing volatility during 2022, but we expect the decline in demand in 2020 and early 2021 from postponements and cancellations of elective procedures to continue to reverse during 2022. Separately, we are also subject to the current trends affecting global shipping and energy prices. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Price increases or interruptions in the _supply of raw materials, including as a result of increased shipping costs, could have a significant impact on our ability to sustain and grow earnings” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Fluctuations in energy costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.”_ In 2021, our business has experienced a clear recovery, as revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 has increased by approximately 4.3% as compared to the same period in 2019. We expect that our revenue from Medical markets will recover from the COVID-19-induced low in 2020 in the near to mid-term as a result of catch-up effects as the underlying market dynamics of long-term growth in procedures, the non-cyclical nature of the business and the continuing shift towards the use of ceramics as this trend did not change as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that the Medical markets will return to the historically high growth rates, though we expect these to be slightly below our historical averages due to lower expected hip penetration rates as compared to rates in periods prior to 2020. We expect there to be a longer recovery to pre-COVID-19 levels in Industrials markets particularly given the market dynamics as the end-markets are more cyclical in nature (e.g., mobility, electronics). Our continued post-COVID-19 normalization has been further supported by a strong order book in 2021. COVID-19 had a clear impact on our order intake and order book in 2020, especially between April and June 2020. Our order intake and order book grew in the months following September 2020, demonstrating a clear recovery. Order intake in the first nine months of 2021 was higher than the equivalent periods in 2019 and 2020 and the order book in September 2021 has substantially increased compared to our order book as of September 30, 2019. Protecting the health and safety of our employees has been a key priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented a large number of measures to minimize the impact of the pandemic on our business, including, among others, providing all employees at our German sites with free FFP2 masks, distributing two free COVID-19 self-tests per week, allowing all indirect employees to work from home over an extended period and implementing hygiene measures for direct shop-floor employees, such as separation walls. In addition, we eliminated business travel for our employees, adopted -13 ----- restrictions regulating visits of third-party staff to our facilities and, for a period of time, tested our own staff regularly before allowing entry to our facilities. We also implemented short-time work (Kurzarbeit) measures to reduce working hours in certain of our plants, from time to time, depending on the specific situation affecting the relevant plant and our customers. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we continue to enforce safety measures depending on both country-specific regulations and plant-specific requirements, reviewing on a regular basis any changes to the measures implemented at a given time, in order to quickly adjust to changing scenarios. We also follow the advice from the authorities with respect to the pandemic and invite regulators to our sites to review safety protocols. Although the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon our business will depend upon the severity and duration of the pandemic as well as actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, our business has remained resilient throughout the pandemic.

Our EBITDA-based measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Our EBITDA-based measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Because of these limitations, our EBITDA-based measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to service our indebtedness.

Restructuring costs in 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020 mainly comprise severance payments for the reduction of staff at CeramTec GmbH and CeramTec-ETEC GmbH relating to restructuring initiatives and also partly related to staff and factory adjustment related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Restructuring costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 relate to further severance payments as well as other factory and product adjustments / terminations. (c) Other non-recurring costs (i) in 2018 mainly comprise strategic consulting services and reorganization costs, (ii) in 2019 mainly comprise consulting and litigation expenses, (iii) in 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020 mainly comprise non-recurring consulting and litigation expenses and COVID-19-related measures to safeguard employees’ health, additional IT spending to adjust to changed work environment, costs of plant shutdown following partly government enacted plant closures or closures related to customers closing their facilities as well as short-time working impact and (iv) in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 mainly comprise redundancy costs, non-recurring consulting and litigation expenses and costs related to plant shutdowns partly as a consequence of government-mandated plant closures. (d) Represents certain impacts such as operating conversion effects from fixed deposits, clearing accounts, bank accounts and trade receivables and trade payables related to currency conversion effects that are accounted for in our Operating income and corresponds to “foreign currency results” of the line item “Other income and expenses, net” as shown in the respective notes to the Financial Statements. (e) Additional contribution related to pensions represent the expenses relating to the pension plan at Pensionskasse Dynamit Nobel VVaG, which was closed at the end of 2014 but with a continuing contractual obligation to cover potential underfunding. On July 20, 2016, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) approved -28 ----- the solvency plan dated June 24, 2016 in favor of Pensionskasse Dynamit Nobel VVaG. The provision was based on the planned payments until 2021. Additional contributions in 2018, 2019, 2020 are based on annual projection by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority. (f) Acquisition costs (i) in 2018, represent certain costs related to the acquisition of the UK electro-ceramics business from Morgan Advanced Materials plc, which was completed in April 2017, (ii) in 2019 and 2020, represent M&A-related consulting and (iii) in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, mainly comprise costs related to the acquisition of Dentalpoint AG. (g) Transaction-related costs comprise certain impacts due to the acquisition of CeramTec Holding by CeramTec AcquiCo that completed and became effective on March 8, 2018. (h) PPA on inventories and fixed assets comprises consumption and write-downs of, respectively, step-ups at transactions, finished goods, work in progress inventories and fixed assets calculated based on customary asset valuation methodology. (i) Start-up losses reflect the ramp-up cost of our knee and dental businesses. (j) Discontinued operations mainly comprise the exit or discontinuation of some product groups and applications for the Industrials markets. (k) Represents the normalization for the net impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including: (i) an adjustment adding back the loss of revenue based on Management Adjusted EBITDA in 2019 of €14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and €3.3 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 related to order postponements and cancellations, primarily related to our business related to the Medical markets, resulting from decreased demand caused by COVID-19 in 2020; (ii) an adjustment of €2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and €0.0 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 related to lost revenues based on the difference between actual and budgeted sales and EBITDA resulting from COVID-19-related production facility shutdowns in India, Malaysia, China, the United Kingdom and the Emil Müller Group; (iii) an adjustment of €(2.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and €(0.5) million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 reflecting the increase in Medical markets revenue related to sale of components for COVID-19 test kits than management considers to be non-recurring; (iv) an adjustment of €(3.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and €(0.9) million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 related to management’s estimates of the additional costs for employee bonuses in 2020 without the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; (v) an adjustment of €15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and €16.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 related to the long-term growth of the market for hip implants without the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as the long-term market growth drivers (e.g., growth in procedures and growth in penetration rates of ceramic products) were largely unaffected by the pandemic. This adjustment is presented net of order postponements and employee bonuses adjustments. (vi) an adjustment of €4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and €1.1 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 reflecting manufacturing cost under-absorption as a result of the underutilization of our production facilities focused on Industrials markets, which, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, includes an assumption of linear unwinding of the effect in 2020. (l) Represents the run-rate positive impact on EBITDA from (i) expected purchasing synergies from integrating current suppliers of Dentalpoint AG with suppliers of the Target Group and (ii) management’s estimated revenues resulting from significant investments in production facilities and new products and a significant ramp-up in new customer acquisitions in CeramTec Malaysia and CeramTec-ETEC GmbH. (m) Constant currency adjustments bring translational and transactional FX effects on EBITDA in line with budget to allow comparison on a consistent basis. (n) Other adjustments include: (i) adjustments to align timing and phasing between periods, including adjustments to eliminate the timing effect resulting from one-off bad debt income and expenses recognized for the same matter in different periods, adjustments for the release of provisions to match the timing of the set-up and related release of such provision, adjustments for employee bonuses to eliminate the release of bonus provisions in a given period and the correspond costs in prior periods and adjustments for consumer bonuses (including both expenses from year-end bonuses to customers and income from malus arrangements) have been re-phased to eliminate out-of-period effects; (ii) a reversal related to COVID-19 shutdown sale losses included in Management Adjustment EBITDA, which have been included in the adjustments described in footnote (j) above; (iii) a reversal of factoring fees and interest expenses for factoring arrangements that are expected to remain in place following the Transactions; (iv) an adjustment for one-off costs for the depreciation of overstocked material related to the Industrials markets; and (v) an adjustment to remove the EBITDA impact of the Nektar business in North America.

The various “adjusted” cost measures are not calculated on the basis of IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as alternatives to cost measures presented in accordance with IFRS. As Non-IFRS Measures, these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, as not all companies calculate these financial measures in the same manner, and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS.

In calculating these financial measures, we make certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to have been inaccurate. In addition, in evaluating these financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of “Adjusted” cost items should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

Further, the nature, extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 or any future disease or adverse health condition is highly uncertain and beyond our control. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing lockdowns, curtailing travel, school closures, prohibitions of mass gatherings, mandatory remote working, and in some countries, limitations on the ability to access production facilities and office buildings. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused significant economic dislocation in many of the countries in which we operate and sell our products, which has resulted in an unprecedented slowdown in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. Were a recession to occur as a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict the length of such recession or the short- and long-term impact it may have on the global economy or our business specifically. Resurgences or further outbreaks of COVID-19 are also likely to occur. We cannot predict when or where any further outbreaks may occur, their duration, how far into the future we may experience outbreaks nor can we predict with any certainty the impacts of such subsequent outbreaks, including the impacts of future national or local lockdowns or other measures implemented by national and/or local authorities. As of September 2021, COVID-19 outbreaks were significantly affecting many countries, including Germany, the United States and other countries in which we operate, with cases rising markedly and with new, more contagious strains of the virus emerging. Any or all such consequences may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on economic activity across our markets and on our business in 2020 and at the start of 2021. In this period, we experienced decreased volumes as non-essential surgeries were postponed and customers had to cancel orders or shift delivery dates given the lower demand from clinics, which negatively impacted our revenue. Performance in Industrials markets has been impacted by a global industrial down-cycle that started in 2019 that which was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also experienced COVID-19 related involuntary plant closures between the February 2020 and August 2020, and again in July 2021, which negatively impacted revenue and EBITDA for the respective periods. In particular, our factories in Malaysia were required to shut down in March and April of 2020, and again in July 2021, following general government directives. Our factory in China also had to close for two weeks in the beginning of February 2020, which negatively impacted sales. In India, lockdowns in March and April 2020 that extended to mid-May 2020 in some regions and subsequent production slowdowns negatively impacted business until August 2020. In addition, we experienced a slowdown in most of our facilities as a result of delays of customer orders, while one of our subsidiaries operating in mobility end-markets, Emil Müller Group, also had to slow production following shutdowns at its major customers due to the lack of raw materials and other components, which negatively impacted revenue. Our manufacturing costs were also impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of such factory closures, costs for cleaning and safety measures, illness rates and quarantines. As a result, revenue decreased by 22.8% from the first quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2020. Overall, we experienced a decrease in revenue of 10.9% in 2020 as compared to 2019. We implemented a large number of measures to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including among others providing all employees at our German sites with free FFP2 masks, distributing two free COVID-19 self-tests per week, allowing all indirect employees to work from home over an extended period and implementing hygiene -32 ----- measures for direct shop-floor employees, such as separation walls. In addition, we eliminated business travel for our employees, adopted restrictions regulating visits of third-party staff to our facilities and, for a period of time, tested our own staff regularly before allowing entry to our facilities. We also implemented short-time work (Kurzarbeit) measures to reduce working hours, from time to time, depending on the specific situation affecting the relevant plant and our customers. We have also incurred certain costs in connection with implementing these mitigating measures. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we continue to enforce safety measures depending on both country-specific regulations and plant-specific requirements, reviewing on a regular basis any changes to the measures implemented at a given time, in order to quickly adjust to changing scenarios. However, these actions may not fully mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, or adequately protect against any outbreaks of COVID-19 at our facilities and offices. We also still remain vulnerable to further lockdowns and COVID-19-inspired adverse events in the short-term, which could result in increasing volatility during 2022. We cannot predict the degree to, or the period over which, we will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given evolving government policies and the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 and despite the development and ongoing rollouts of vaccines, there may be further impacts on the economies or the consumer purchasing power of the countries where we operate. Any of the foregoing including any resulting deterioration in general economic conditions or change in consumer behavior, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.

As ceramic penetration in global medical implant markets is steadily rising, leading to market-leading growth for ceramic components, new competitors may aim to enter this market. For example, in 2016 and 2017, two of our competitors launched ceramic ball head products. These companies may in the future gain market share in the U.S., Europe, Asia or elsewhere. We are also susceptible to changes in the Medical market dynamics of the industry in which our customers operate. For example, in the past there has been consolidation in the medical implant industry and in the future, there may be further consolidation, which may impact our revenue. As a consequence, we might be faced with price pressure which could result in lower revenue and could particularly impact our margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

The customer base for our hip joint implants is highly concentrated. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the top four Medical markets customers made up 44% of our Medical markets revenue and the top ten customers accounted for 63% of its revenue. Our customers are orthopedic implant OEMs, including the top orthopedic implant OEMs who together have a strong presence in the global hip implant market. Any consolidation in our customer base for hip implant products could result in further pricing pressure which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition results of operations and prospects. We maintain good and long-standing customer relationships with all large orthopedic hip implant OEMs. If our relationship with one or more of our largest customers deteriorates or if we fail to extend our contractual relationships with any of our key customers at favorable terms, or at all, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Our BIOLOX[®] products are considered an industry benchmark in the market for ceramic joint replacements. The success of our BIOLOX[®] products is largely dependent on our close collaborative partnerships with orthopedic manufacturers, material scientists and surgeons, and any negative perception of the quality of these products could have a material adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, potential product failures and recalls, negative claims or publicity involving us or our products, or the production methods of any of our suppliers or the materials we source, could seriously damage our reputation and brand -33 ----- image, regardless of whether such claims or publicity are accurate.

With some of our customers, we have short-term contracts that will soon expire if not renewed. See also “—We rely on a limited number of large customers, in particular in the Medical _markets, for a significant part of our revenues and our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if our relationship with any of our key customers deteriorates or ends.” While negotiations for the renewal of these_ contractual relationships are currently ongoing, the relevant customers may decide not to renew their contract with the Group. Any loss of such a customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and the inability to retain such customers, or to replace business generated by such customers, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. As a result, the loss or deterioration of such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition results of operations and prospects. In addition, we believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong, long-term relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance, reduce costs, or support new product development. This is largely due to our customers’ needs for tailored products that very often require joint development efforts. However, even in cases where we co-develop a product with a customer, it will be for one application only. If our customer develops or upgrades a product or process, we need to offer a newly tailored product meeting our customer’s new specifications. This may require us to invest more in research and development and to increase marketing costs so that we can strengthen existing customer relationships as well as attract new customers. If our key competitors are able to innovate faster, spend more on R&D, or generally develop technology for ceramic products or comparable products from substitute materials more cost effectively or with a higher quality, our customers may opt to work with our competitors instead of us. Inability to keep key customers and failure to attract new customers due to a perceived lack of innovation could materially affect our reputation which would further reduce our ability to compete. We believe that product quality, product specifications, innovation and customer service are key competitive factors for our business. If we are unable to develop, produce or market our products effectively to our existing or new customers, we may lose key customers or fail to acquire new customers. As a result, any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.6,"Some of our products, as well as our manufacturing processes and facilities and medical customers are subject to extensive regulation under applicable law, by the FDA or by other governmental agencies. Changes in these regulations or failure by us or our customers to comply with them could adversely affect our business.","Regulatory requirements for our medical products as well as components for such medical products are complex, costly and far reaching. Any failure to comply with them could subject us and/or our customers to fines, injunctions, civil penalties, lawsuits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial of government approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution. Any of these actions could adversely impact our revenue, undermine goodwill established with our customers, damage commercial prospects for our products and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Globally, our products are marketed in more than 65 countries and each of these countries may regulate our products and processes differently. In the United States, before we or our customers can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to, an existing product, we or they must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or approval of a premarket approval (or “PMA”), from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. Certain of our DENSILOX[®] implant products have received marketing authorization pursuant to the 510(k) clearance process, and our OEM customers have obtained 510(k) clearances and PMA approvals for certain products that utilize our BIOLOX[®] components. Obtaining FDA clearances or approvals for any new medical devices or modifications to existing medical devices can be time consuming and can be delayed or rejected by the FDA for many reasons. In the United States, the manufacture and supply of our ceramic ball head and cup inserts for hip joint prostheses systems is subject to the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, which imposes current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements on the manufacture of medical devices. While we have successfully completed FDA audits and audits by our customers in the past, there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future. In addition, our medical device customers to whom we supply our ceramic ball head and cup inserts are subject to FDA regulation, including premarket approval and post market compliance requirements of their hip joint prostheses systems. In the EU, our medical products are required to comply with the essential requirements under the EU Medical Devices Regulation, which entered into force in May 2021. This new regulation generally increases standards applicable to -34 ----- conformity assessment procedures and requires more stringent scrutiny by notified bodies when conducting audits, among other things. Compliance with these requirements entitles us and our customers to affix a CE mark to the medical devices verifying products meet EU safety, health or environmental requirements. As implantable devices for hip joint prostheses, certain of our medical products are considered high risk medical devices falling within Class III. Our customers therefore have to undergo a recurring conformity assessment procedure including stringent audits by a so called “notified body” for these products. Unless our customers successfully complete this conformity assessment, they do not have the right to carry the CE mark. Without the CE mark, the customers’ medical devices cannot be commercialized in the European Union. Compliance with relevant regulations is monitored by the respective authorities of EU member states. Furthermore, our customers are subject to other legal regulatory requirements in additional end-markets, such as, for example, China, which we continuously monitor. Changes to these regulations or non-compliance by our customers or by us can lead to market withdrawals of our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations The FDA may take several years or longer to grant premarket approval of our or our customers’ new medical devices, if at all. European conformity assessment procedures are equally challenging and time consuming. Further, our competitors may seek pre-market approval for products that compete with our medical products for ceramic hip joint prostheses. At any time, our customers’ total hip prostheses systems may be withdrawn from the market either voluntarily by our customers or as a result of the FDA’s or a foreign equivalent’s withdrawal of marketing approval or removal of such products for a number of reasons including safety, current Good Manufacturing Practice or Quality System Regulation problems with our products or our customers’ final products. For example, a customer initiated a voluntary recall in August 2010 of its hip implant system. Any such regulatory action could significantly impact our revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Specifically in the United States, certain of our customers’ hip joint prostheses systems have obtained PMA approval or 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Governmental regulations relate to the testing, development, manufacturing, labeling, design, sale, promotion, distribution, importing, exporting and shipping of our products. We cannot assure you that any regulatory clearances or approvals, either foreign or domestic, will be granted or maintained for our key medical customers’ new products that include our products on a timely basis, if at all. If our key medical customers are unable to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances for use of their medical devices, the commercial success of our products could be limited. Regulators may also limit the claims that we or our customers can make about our products. Approval processes differ in the United States, Europe, Asia and other jurisdictions and the approval in the U.S. or any other single jurisdiction does not guarantee approval in any other jurisdiction. Obtaining foreign approvals for our customers’ medical devices could involve significant delays, difficulties and costs for our customers, which could adversely affect the commercial success of our products. If the FDA or any other regulatory authority does not grant the necessary marketing authorizations for our customers’ medical devices, due to deficiencies of our products or any other component used in our customers’ medical devices, our customers may no longer be able to market their medical devices in their markets or may even choose to switch to another supplier. As a result, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We and our customers are required to pass inspections and to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in order for our customers to continue to sell their hip joint prostheses systems. Any failure to pass an inspection or to comply with regulatory requirements could adversely impact our operations through a recall or seizure of products, an issuance of warning letters and operating restrictions or the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production or sale of hip joint prostheses systems. In addition, we could incur substantial remediation costs.

The discovery of serious safety issues with our medical products, or a recall, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, could have a negative impact on us.","We and certain of our customers are subject to the FDA’s medical device reporting regulations and similar national and international regulations, which require manufacturers to report to the FDA upon becoming aware of information that reasonably suggests that their medical devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or severely malfunctioned. We also have a contractual obligation to inform our customers if we become aware of any of our products -35 ----- exhibiting adverse medical effects.

This in turn could adversely affect our reputation as well as our product sales. The FDA and other national regulatory bodies have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. The FDA’s authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device could cause serious injury or death. We or our medical customers may also choose to voluntarily recall a product if any material deficiency is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or our customers could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing defects, labeling or design deficiencies, packaging defects or other deficiencies or failures to comply with applicable regulations.

79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.9,The existence of adequate coverage and reimbursement is important for the sales of our products. Inadequate coverage and reimbursement policies and changes in health care reimbursement systems in the U.S. and elsewhere could reduce our revenues and profitability.,"Sales of medical devices largely depend on the reimbursement of patients’ medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers. Without the financial support of government reimbursement or third-party insurers’ payments for patient care, the market for our medical customers’ hip joint prostheses systems, and in turn, our products, will be limited. In the United States and in certain other jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory reforms that have changed the regulatory and healthcare systems in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or the “ACA”)) was enacted, which significantly impacted the medical device industry in the United States. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act imposed an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, beginning in 2013 (the “Medical Device Excise Tax” or the “MDET”). In addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, establishes payment levels for hospitals and physicians on an annual basis, which can increase or decrease payment to such entities. The ACA also established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research, and created an independent payment advisory board to submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate. Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which include, among other things, reductions to Medicare payments to providers, as well as changes made by third-party payors to the reimbursement amounts and/or payment methodologies used to determine such amounts, any of which could have a negative effect on those selling products to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and surgeons, including medical device manufacturers. Any reduction in such payment amounts could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures. However, there have been recent executive and legislative actions to amend or impede the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and ongoing efforts to repeal, replace or further modify the Affordable Care Act which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, the MDET was suspended for 2018 and 2019 as a result of the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, certain bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. In particular, on January 22, 2018, former President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the MDET on non-exempt medical devices. Since then, The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act 2020, signed into law on December 20, 2019, repealed the MDET. Congress has also enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance and delaying the implementation of certain fees mandated by the Affordable Care Act. In addition, former President Trump signed additional executive orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Further, on December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling -36 ----- that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states, without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. The full impact on our business of the ACA and other new laws is uncertain. Nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the demand for our products. Future actions by the U.S. administration and the U.S. Congress including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement of the ACA could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, all or a portion of the ACA and related subsequent legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated through other judicial challenge. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and remained open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA, will impact the ACA or our business. The current presidential administration and Congress may pursue significant changes to the current healthcare laws. We face uncertainties that might result from modifications or repeal of any of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. The impact of those changes on us and potential effect on business is currently unknown. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Any changes to the Affordable Care Act are also likely to have an impact on our results of operations, and may negatively affect our business, financial condition and prospects. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The net effect of the Affordable Care Act, as currently in effect, on our business is subject to a number of variables, including the law’s complexity, lack of complete implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, and the sporadic implementation of the numerous programs designed to improve access to and the quality of healthcare services. Additional variables of the Affordable Care Act impacting our business will be how states, providers, insurance companies, employers, and other market participants respond during this period of uncertainty surrounding the future of the Affordable Care Act. Further, sales of medical devices in China are subject to importation authorizations and purchasing tender processes governed by local authorities. In 2021, Chinese authorities published a new system regulating official tenders for medical devices. The growth of our sales volumes in China is dependent on acting in accordance with the relevant purchasing tender authorizations, as applicable from time to time. However, the timing and the magnitude of any changes or updates to these official tender systems remain uncertain, and we may continue to experience significant variability as it relates to our sales in China. In addition, on an international level, medical reimbursement systems vary significantly from country to country, with some countries limiting medical centers’ spending through fixed budgets, regardless of the levels of patient treatment, and other countries requiring application for, and approval of, government or third party reimbursement. Uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy, legislation and regulation, as well as private market practices, could affect our customers’ ability to sell their hip implant system in commercially acceptable quantities at profitable prices and therefore could also impact our revenues, profit margins, operating cash flows and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

For example, we may be notified by a customer, patient, treating surgeon, or hospital, alleging that the relevant surgery resulted in the implantation of a medical device that includes a defective component produced by the Group. We have been named as defendants in a number of product liability lawsuits in Europe, substantially all of which alleged various claims against our ceramic hip joint components and, in the past, we were named in lawsuits in the United States relating to broken artificial hip joints. See “—We are subject _to the risk of litigation and other claims” and “Business—Legal Proceedings.”_ In addition many of our products are integrated into our customers’ products, and we may be requested to participate in or share in the costs of a product recall conducted by a customer. For example, we supply products to customers in the mobility industry. In the event one of these customers conducts a product recall that it believes is related to one of our products, we may be asked to participate in or fund in whole or in part such a recall. Our customers often require us to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers. Any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action against us. -37 ----- We are unable to estimate our exposure, if any, to the above-mentioned product liability lawsuits at this time. While we do not believe we have any material liability associated with our current litigation and that our provisions for the lawsuits will be sufficient, there can be no assurance that we will not be exposed to material liability. We may be subject to future claims with regard to these suits or others like them and we may not be able to avoid significant product liability exposure. In addition, any such claims may be costly to defend. While we maintain insurance against product liability claims, this insurance is limited to €100 million and there can be no assurance that a claim will be covered. A successful product liability claim or series of claims against us for which we are not otherwise indemnified or insured could materially increase our operating costs or prevent us from satisfying our financial obligations. We may not have sufficient cash flow from operations or assets to pay a judgment resulting from a product liability claim or product recall, if any, for which there is inadequate insurance coverage. Any such judgment or product recall could materially increase our operating costs or prevent us from satisfying our financial obligations and materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, lawsuits relating to alleged deficiencies in our medical products, specifically our ceramic hip replacement components, could materially impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality ceramic components and could lead to the loss of our customers’ FDA market authorizations for hip implants that include our ceramic components or the loss of other regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions and could prevent or delay approvals for future products that include our ceramic components.

Since early 2020, the primary factor in increased uncertainty globally from an economic and social perspective has been the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted, and may continue to result, in materially increased volatility and declines in financial markets and weaker demand in the global economy. Measures implemented, or intended to be implemented, by governments or governmental bodies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on supply chains resulting, for instance, in plant closures or increases in the cost of raw materials, and generally impact business operations across the economy both as a result of weakened economic activity and the employees being affected. Furthermore, global economic conditions have been, and are likely to continue to be, affected by concerns over increased geopolitical tensions as well as international political developments, such as the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020, the threat of escalated trade disputes on a global level and the collapse of the Afghan government in August 2021. It is difficult to predict how economic conditions will develop, as they are impacted by macro movements of the financial markets and many other factors, including the stock, bond and derivatives markets as well as measures taken by various governmental and regulatory authorities and central banks. Uncertainty remains in the global markets and the global economy could experience another recession, or a depression, which could be more prolonged or have a greater financial impact than the global recessions that began in 2008. Any downturns in general economic conditions that impact consumer spending, particularly in the countries where we sell a significant portion of our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the mobility, electronics, construction and other industrial end-markets we serve are cyclical, and both general macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control could reduce demand from any one of these markets for our products. Demand for our products is significantly affected by the business success of our OEM customers as well as end users that purchase products from those OEM customers. For example, weak economic conditions could depress new car sales, negatively impacting our mobility customers, thereby reducing demand for our ceramic components in automobiles and engines. Similarly, reduced global economic activity could hinder global industrial output, which could decrease demand for our ceramic cutting tools and textile components. General economic or industry-specific downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

For example, the industries and end-markets into which we sell our products experience rapid technological change and product improvement, evolving standards, rules and regulations, evolving patient and surgeon needs. Manufacturers in the high performance ceramics business periodically introduce new generations of products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products. In order to remain competitive, we will need to anticipate and respond to these changes, which requires continued investment in, and time spent on, innovation and research and development. -38 ----- While we strive to maintain strong technological capabilities to remain at the forefront of the markets we operate in, the process of developing new, high technology products and services and improving existing products and services is however complex and uncertain. Any failure to anticipate, identify and keep pace with the changing needs of patients, surgeons and OEMs and emerging technological trends, growing use of alternative materials to ceramics such as metal or polymer as materials in the hip implant market, as well as any failure to introduce attractive and innovative products and services, could lead to a decline in the use of the our products and services which could in turn significantly damage our market share and economic results. For example, polyethylene and polymer liners are cheaper than ceramics, while their resistance to wear, when highly cross-linked, is almost equivalent of that of ceramics. In addition, any delay in offering new products and services, or failure to differentiate our products and services or accurately predict and address market trends and demand, could render our products and services less desirable or even obsolete, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our products could also become obsolete sooner than we expect and be replaced by a new solution, product or material. For example, an alternative treatment to hip joint replacement for osteoporosis patients could be developed or new products that we are currently developing for dental, spine, knee and shoulder implants may not reach the market according to our current planned timeline. Furthermore, the penetration of our hip implant insert components might not grow as expected due to technological improvements of Polyethylene inserts, surgeon preferences, or any perceived issues related to ceramic-on-ceramic hip implants. We must anticipate and respond to industry and customer changes, including by taking advantage of the growing use of ceramic in dental and other orthopedic implants in addition to hip, in order to remain competitive. We may be required to make investments to develop new technologies before knowing whether predictions will accurately reflect customer preferences, or if we are not able to develop the necessary technologies internally, we may have to incur expenses in an attempt to obtain a license or acquire technologies from third parties. Our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all our key end-markets and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop, manufacture and market products for our OEM customers who compete in such changing end-markets. We will have to continue to effectively identify, develop, market and in certain cases, secure regulatory approval for, innovative products on a timely basis to replace or enhance existing products. Because of the lengthy and costly development process, technological challenges and intense competition, we cannot assure you that any of the products and/or technology we are currently developing, or could begin to develop in the future, either alone or with third parties, will result in a technically viable product and achieve substantial commercial success. While we develop products and services that we expect will address new market opportunities that are not yet fully developed (including, for example, the dental implant, spine, knee and shoulder implant markets), there is no guarantee that these new opportunities will develop as we currently anticipate. There is also no guarantee that our products and services will secure broad acceptance from OEMs and surgeons, that such products and services will be consistent with developing industry standards, that we will succeed in gaining market share in these new markets or that we will fully recover investments made in acquiring or developing such products. For example, it is expected that the growth of the usage of ceramics in dental implants will be driven by a combination of factors, including better aesthetics and biocompatibility. However, we may not be able to develop or market technological advances and introduce new products in a manner and to an extent sufficient to remain competitive in this sector. More specifically, we may not be able to invest the human and financial resources required to develop these products or make mistakes or incorrect assessments in our planning with regard to these sectors or encounter difficulties in launching the products. Furthermore, we may not be able to meet the product development and delivery schedules due to unforeseen problems during the design, development or production stages of new products and the introduction of new technologies. Delays in product development may also require further investments in research and development. If there is an increase in costs associated with the development of new products and the improvement of products for which we will not achieve sufficient revenue, the development costs of new products may not be recoverable. An increase in costs or a decrease in revenue from new products, or both, could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Failure to maintain innovation or the introduction of new or updated technologies that respond to needs and preferences of patients, surgeons, OEMs in Medical markets, or our customers in the Industrials markets, or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our competitiveness and could cause us to lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We face substantial competition from our primary competitors, -39 ----- but also from many other international, national, regional and local competitors of various sizes. Competition is particularly intense in the mobility, electronics and several niche industrial end-markets where product-oriented competition is acute. Various competitors such as 3M Company, Coorstek or Kyocera are larger than us and have greater financial resources. Other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products. As such, we face substantial risk that certain events, including new product development by our competitors, changing customer needs, production advances for competing products or the replacement of ceramic products with products made from different materials could result in declining demand for our products and reduce our market shares as our customers switch to our competitors’ products or undertake to manufacture such products on their own. In particular, increasing competition from competitors in Asia may lead to lower prices for our products.

Currently, we operate facilities in countries such as Germany, the United States, Brazil, India, China, Czech Republic, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Our products are also distributed, directly or indirectly, in more than 65 countries, and our operations are affected directly and indirectly by global regulatory, economic and political conditions. Thus, we are exposed to a range of factors that we cannot easily influence and that could have an impact on our business activities in these countries. These factors include the following: - changes in the rate of economic growth; - political, social, economic, financial and market instability and volatility; - war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; - foreign currency controls and foreign currency exchange volatility; - changes in government policies and regulations or imperfect application of such regulations; - trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; - inadequately developed and inconsistent legal and administrative systems, which can lead, for example, to expropriations, the inadequate protection of intellectual property rights or can jeopardize the enforcement of receivables and other claims; - burdensome tariffs and other trade barriers and delays associated with customs procedures, including increased security requirements applicable to foreign goods and measures related to COVID-19 and Brexit; - imposition of confiscatory taxation or adverse taxes, other charges and restrictions on imports, currency, interest and exchange rate risks, changes in double tax treaties; - managing and obtaining support and distribution for local operations; - increased costs and availability of raw materials, transportation or shipping; - credit risk, financial conditions and compliance risk of local customers, distributors and other agents; - risks related to labor practices increasing minimum wages and inflationary pressures, national and regional labor strikes; - increased risk of fraud and corruption; and - the risk that regulations will become less favorable to our business. We may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to counter the foregoing factors effectively in each location where we do business. Our failure to do so could limit our ability to sell products, compete or receive payments for products sold in such locations.

All raw material costs constituted approximately one third of our cost of products sold. Because the properties we require from our raw materials are highly specific and the properties of these raw materials reflect their manufacturing processes, as well as the specific properties and distinctive characteristics of their precursors, we typically source each type of raw materials only from a single supplier. We have identified more than one suitable raw material supplier only in the case of a few specific raw materials. We keep additional safety stock for most single-sourced raw materials, and our risk management monitors critical suppliers and attempts to identify suitable alternative supply channels, but there can be no guarantee that we any such mitigation efforts will be successful or that our stock will be sufficient in the case of supply chain disruptions. Supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of certain raw materials could result in supply imbalances that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Increases in the price of resources, such as natural gas, petrol, electricity and water, whether as a result of inflation, shortages or interruptions in supply, or otherwise, could also materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects. Our ability to respond to increased costs for raw materials by increasing our prices or implementing alternative processes and supply chains will depend on our ability to anticipate and react to such increases in the contest of the prevailing general economic conditions, as well as the responses of our suppliers, competitors and customers. Each of these factors is difficult to predict and beyond our control. Accordingly, increased costs, and the uncertainty related thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We generally purchase raw materials based on supply agreements, in which prices are fixed for no longer than 12 months. As a result, we may be subject to fluctuations in raw materials prices. These fluctuations limit our ability to accurately forecast future raw material costs and hence our profitability. Our ability to increase the prices of our products in order to pass-on any increases in raw materials costs to our customers is dependent upon our contractual arrangements and economic conditions. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher raw materials costs, our financial results could deteriorate. Separately, we are subject to the current trends affecting global shipping. Shipping costs have grown significantly since 2020, due to a number of factors, including imbalances in global trade and countries locking down and reopening at different times due to varying patterns of local COVID-19 outbreaks. In addition, while global demand for shipping has increased robustly over the past year following the easement of lockdown measures due to COVID-19 and the gradual reopening of numerous economies, shipping continued to suffer delays due to port congestion, port closures (including the protracted closures affecting the Ningbo-Zhoushan port in China in August 2021), vessel delays and extraordinary accidents such as the March 2021 Suez Canal closure. In addition, disruptions to or increases in the cost of local, regional domestic or international transportation services for our products due to shortages of vessels, barges, railcars or trucks, weather-related problems, flooding, droughts, accidents, mechanical difficulties, bankruptcy, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks or other events could increase our costs, temporarily impair our ability to deliver products to our customers on time or at all and might, in certain circumstances, constitute a force majeure event under our customer contracts, permitting our customers to suspend taking delivery of and paying for our products or resulting in a charge to us for our customers’ lost profits as a result of our failure to timely deliver our products. We have experienced an increase in raw material, energy and shipping costs and have experienced delays of deliveries of parts and components from our global suppliers, and of products to our customers, due to which we have recently increased, and plan to further increase, prices for a broad range of products and customers. While these delays and cost increases are not currently at a level that they have caused a material disruption or negative impact to our profitability, these delays and costs may increase to a point that they may negatively impact our financial results and ability to grow our business. Any events leading to price increases and scarcity of raw materials, packaging materials, utilities or freight required to deliver raw materials to our facilities could disrupt our operations, or negatively impact demand for our products if we pass such price increases onto customers and subsequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, either temporarily or permanently.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.16,Fluctuations in energy costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.,"Energy costs are a significant component of our operating expenses and increasing energy costs, unless offset by more efficient usage or other operational responses, may impact our profitability. Energy purchases in 2020 constituted approximately 5% to 6% of our cost of sales. Energy prices have been volatile in the past and may increase in the future, also given current geopolitical conditions. In addition, energy prices (including the prices for crude oil and natural gas), are subject to a variety of factors beyond our control, such as the domestic and foreign supply dynamics, consumer demand, local regulation and tax regimes and market expectations regarding supply and demand. For example, we recorded a recent dramatic increase in natural gas prices in September of 2021, as global supplies were depleted by a series of extreme weather -41 ----- events (including, most recently, heatwaves in Europe and the US, and Hurricane Ida which forced a production halt in many gas production facilities located in the Gulf of Mexico). In addition, our shipping costs have also increased due to fuel and freight prices affected by the above-mentioned trends. We may not be able to recover these rising costs through increased prices charged to our customers. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in attempts to protect against these increases in energy costs through long-term energy contracts, improved energy procurement, improved efficiency and other operational improvements, the overall costs of operating our stores will increase, which could impact our profitability, financial condition and results of operations. Fluctuations in the price of energy limit our ability to accurately forecast future energy costs and consequently our profitability. Our management expects electricity costs in Germany, where we maintain the majority of our production volumes and energy consumption to increase over the coming years. Rising energy costs may increase our production costs and negatively impact our customers and the demand for their products. These risks will be heightened if our customers or production facilities are in locations experiencing severe energy shortages. If energy prices fluctuate significantly, or we experience severe energy shortages, our business or results of operations may be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

If one or more of our production facilities were to suffer a serious accident, breakdown, equipment malfunction or other unexpected events, a part of our production capacity could be jeopardized and our sales would be materially adversely affected until we repaired or found a replacement for any such facility and/or machinery. Further, our production was reduced or halted in 2020 and 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on our business and results during that period. While we maintain insurance to cover property damages and other material damages, depending on the risk and type of asset or property insured, any losses related to a serious accident, equipment malfunction or other unexpected event could exceed the amount of this coverage. Further, any interruption in our production capabilities, generally, will inevitably increase our production costs and reduce our sales and earnings for the affected period. Moreover, any interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy the problem, which could have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows. We may sustain a loss in revenue in excess of any recoveries we make under our business interruption insurance coverage. Longer-term business disruption could result in a loss of customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, the refurbishment or reconstruction of any of our production facilities or the construction of new facilities could be subject to regulatory approval in the jurisdictions in which they are located, which could result in significant delays in the resumption of product manufacturing.

Further, agreed limits and other restrictions (for example, exclusions) within the insurance coverage may prove to be too low or inadequate for compensating potential damages or losses, ultimately resulting in a gap in the insurance coverage. There can moreover be no assurance that our insurance providers will continue to grant coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at all. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive related to the risks presented. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance policies may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to renew our insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, there are risks left intentionally uninsured (such as, but not limited to, customer or supplier insolvency, industrial disputes or specific natural hazards), and we therefore have no insurance against these events. If we sustain damages, losses or liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage, if we encounter a delay in the payment of insurance proceeds, or if we have to pay higher insurance premiums or encounter restrictions on insurance coverage, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

For example, our operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations at national, international and local levels in numerous jurisdictions. New laws or regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations, particularly those health and safety or environmental protection, may conceivably require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and could increase our cost of doing business. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal. The nature of our industry exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production, storage, transportation, disposal and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment. In 2020, our capital expenditures for safety, health and environmental matters were €1.2 million. Compliance with environmental laws such as air emission or water protection laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing, the cost of registration/approval requirements, the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products, as well as the costs of the storage and disposal of wastes, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations, for violations arising under these laws or permit requirements as well as in connection with subsequent orders, the withdrawal or revocation of permits and the renewal of permits. Furthermore, environmental laws are subject to change and have tended to become stricter over time. This is particularly the case with regard to changes in connection with the Industry Emissions Directive (Directive 2010/75/EU) and subsequent national legislation by EU member states transforming this directive which imposes additional and stricter obligations such as further specified basic obligations, notification obligations of the installation operator and stricter emission thresholds. Such changes in environmental laws or their interpretation, or the enactment of new environmental laws, could result in materially increased capital expenditures and compliance costs. Potential changes in laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement or alternative interpretation of existing laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we currently operate can change the legal and regulatory environment, making compliance with all applicable laws and regulations more challenging. Various governments and intergovernmental organizations could introduce proposals for tax legislation, or adopt tax law, that may have an adverse effect on our worldwide effective tax rate, or increase our tax liability, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, or our deferred tax liabilities. Changes in laws and regulations in the future could have an adverse economic impact on us by tightening restrictions, reducing our freedom to do business, increasing our costs of doing business, or reducing our profitability. In addition, the compliance costs associated with such evolving laws and regulations may be significant. We have experienced certain limited instances of non-compliance in the past, which were addressed or are in the process of being addressed. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations can lead to civil, administrative or criminal penalties, including but not limited to fines or the revocation of permits and licenses that may be necessary for our business activities. We could also be required to pay damages or civil judgments in respect of third-party claims. In addition, the discovery of contamination arising from historical industrial operations at some of our former and present properties has exposed us, and in the future may continue to expose us, to cleanup obligations and other damages. For example, soil and groundwater contamination is known to exist or to potentially exist or to have existed at seven of our current facilities (for example, concentrations of trichloroethylene and hydrocarbon were identified at our Ruabon site in the UK), however, we have not identified regulatory drivers for further soil and groundwater investigation or remediation as some of these sites have already met the relevant remediation targets, or impacts with material costs implication. We have received indemnities from previous owners of our sites related to remediation works undertaken by them, but there can be no assurance that such indemnities will fully cover any liabilities associated with those sites. In addition, we maintain liability for the ongoing water treatment and associated measures at our former manufacturing facility located in Wallkill, NY, which was disposed in 2000. Based on the most recent monitoring conducted in October 2016, this former site recorded high levels of residual VOC concentrations. We allocate approximately $25 thousand to $30 thousand on a yearly basis, to cover any remaining soil and groundwater contamination related expenses at this former site. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we have provisions set up for environmental risks and claims in the amount of €0.3 million. There can be no assurance that these provisions will be sufficient to fund our portion of any clean-up costs. Regulatory changes in the key markets in which we will operate can also have an impact on our business. For example, new regulations may require the mandatory usage of lead-free piezo ceramics in the near future, or introduce other requirements affecting the materials which we utilize in our daily operations for the manufacturing of our products. Our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and to adapt to technological changes and the evolution of -43 ----- regulatory requirements, which may require major research and development activities, entailing associated research and development costs. We might not have, or might not be able to attract, the personnel necessary for such research and development activities.

Though we have a large number of patents, we do not possess patent protection for all of our key products such as, for example, our BIOLOX[®] ceramic hip implant products, and instead, for such products, we rely heavily on our manufacturing know-how, which is not a legally registered right, to protect our market position. We conduct research and development activities with third parties and co-develop certain intellectual property. The confidentiality and patent assignment agreements with our employees and third parties to protect the confidentiality, ownership and use of intellectual property may be breached, may not be enforceable, or may provide for joint ownership or ownership by a third party.

The steps we take to protect our intellectual property, including patents, proprietary technology and trademarks, may not be successful and may be challenged by third parties. For example, since 2013 we have been involved in a series of legal proceedings against C5 in Germany, the United States and France in relation to our trademarks for the distinctive pink color of our ceramic hip implant component BIOLOX[®] delta, in respect of which we incurred significant expenses and which remain ongoing. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” In addition, Dentalpoint AG, and one of our German subsidiaries are involved in separate intellectual property litigation proceedings. If we must sue to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of company resources and management attention, and we may not prevail in such action. In addition, a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position. We cannot be sure that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our patents and other proprietary rights will be adequate to protect our rights, or that any of our intellectual property will not be challenged or held invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and proprietary rights of others. We may not always be able to secure protection for, or stop infringements of, our intellectual property, and may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any litigation or dispute involving the scope or enforceability of our intellectual property rights, however, as well as any allegation that we infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others, could be costly and time-consuming. In addition, if we are unable to protect our technology and intellectual property, or if key products are not subject to sufficient or any intellectual property protection, our competitors may, even temporarily, misappropriate our technologies and intellectual property rights and develop competing products, which could also have a material adverse effect on the our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.

Whenever a contract expires or is due for renewal, suppliers may seek price adjustment from us. In addition, under the terms of certain contracts, suppliers may seek a price adjustment when their business experiences significant volume changes. Further, certain suppliers may seek to increase prices previously agreed with us due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the supplier.

In addition, third-party litigation, including litigation related to competition law, anti-trust law, tax law and patent law could have an indirect, materially adverse impact on us and the market environment in which we operate. When we determine that a significant risk of a future claim against us exists, we record provisions in an amount equal to our estimated liability. As of December 31, 2020, we set aside total provisions for legal disputes in an amount of €0.5 million and total provisions for tax-related disputes under other liabilities in an amount of €3.2 million. Further, as of December 31, 2020, we have set aside provisions in an amount of €3.4 million to cover for claims related to breach of warranties and product liability. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” However, the amount of total provisions for tax and legal disputes in our financial statements for future periods could increase. Our insurance or indemnities or amounts we have provisioned may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation claims or similar matters under various laws or that product specific provisions will be sufficient to cover litigation costs. Moreover, it may be difficult for us to obtain and enforce claims related to existing litigation under the laws of certain countries in which we operate at affordable costs and without any materially adverse effects on our business in such country. In the aftermath of public health measures implemented in the jurisdictions in which we operate as well as our temporary personnel initiatives due to the impact of COVID-19, we could be subject to an increase in litigation, in particular in relation to our suppliers and our employees, including with respect to health and safety measures.

The loss of any senior manager or key employee may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development or business objectives. Further, our directors, officers, senior managers and other key employees may retire as they near retirement age, which could also impact our hiring and recruitment needs. Due to the specialized nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and sales personnel. The market for qualified personnel is -45 ----- competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel, or may fail to replace departing personnel with suitable successors. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in the relevant position we seek to fill and there can be no certainty that we will be able to identify or employ qualified internal or external candidates within a reasonable timeframe. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, key management, scientific, technical or sales personnel could be materially detrimental to our business and financial condition. In addition, loss of employees engaged in our research and development activities may lead to a loss of know-how and research progress, with a consequent increase of costs. We face competition for scientific and technical personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organization. Such competition is enhanced by changing population demographics, influencing the recruitment of skilled and executive personnel, and the reduction of specialized personnel in certain key functional areas, such as in the case of engineers in Germany. Our efforts to retain and develop personnel may also result in additional expenses (such as higher wages), which could adversely affect our profitability. We therefore cannot guarantee that key personnel, including executive officers, will remain in their employment or that we will be able to attract qualified personnel in the future.

Several suppliers have manufacturing processes which are very complex and require a long lead-time. Occasional delays may affect our ability to obtain products. Our production of these products will also be materially and adversely affected if the outsourced production is unreliable, late or of inferior quality. In addition, any reduction in the precision of these products will cause delays and interruptions in our production cycle. Within our production facilities, minute impurities, difficulties in the production process or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or be non-functional. This can result in unexpectedly low production yields and increased scrap rates, which delay product shipments and may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Because the majority of our manufacturing costs are relatively fixed, production yield and capacity utilization rate are critical to our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Personnel expenses make up a significant portion of our costs and we are obliged to comply with various works council and other agreements that are in place with works councils and other employee representative bodies. In addition, we are a member of the employers’ Association of the Ceramic Industry e.V. (Verband der keramischen _Industrie e.V.) and are therefore bound by the collective bargaining agreements (Tarifverträge) entered into the employers’_ association and the mining, chemical and energy industrial union (Industriegewerkschaft Bergbau, Chemie, Energie). As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 3,400 FTE employees worldwide, consisting of sales, technical, manufacturing, operations, supply chain and customer service personnel, excluding approximately 350 contract labor (Leiharbeiter) workers. All of our employees in Germany and a substantial number of our employees globally are covered by labor agreements, including works agreements. Employees at our German locations have traditionally been heavily unionized and we regularly conduct, or are involved in, negotiations with the relevant employee representative bodies. For example, we recently renegotiated employee tariffs applicable at certain of our German production facilities. Any deterioration of these relationships could adversely impact our business operations. In the future, we may be subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. While we believe that we have good relations with unions and employees generally, there can be no assurance that our relations will not deteriorate and that we will not experience labor disputes in the future. Any such strikes, conflicts, work stoppages or other industrial actions may, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Additionally, future negotiations with unions or works councils in connection with existing labor agreements may result in significant increases in our cost of labor, divert management’s attention away from operating our business, disrupt our production and sales activities, damage our reputation, adversely affect our customer relations or break down and disrupt operations. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages at our suppliers or customers that are beyond our control. There can also be no assurance that our employees will not make claims or that we will not incur work stoppages in the future.

Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with international, EU, U.S., UK and other national and local laws, and our failure to successfully comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. These laws and regulations apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, as well as anti-corruption laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The FCPA and other laws prohibit us and our officers, directors, employees and agents acting on our behalf from offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises and, to a lesser degree, with governmental authorities, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. We are also subject to the jurisdiction of various governments and regulatory agencies outside of the United States, which may bring our personnel into contact with foreign officials responsible for issuing or renewing permits, licenses or approvals or for enforcing other governmental regulations. In addition, some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption (for example, Brazil or China). Our employees may be tempted to win business with illegal practices, in particular corruption, certain sales incentives or violation of antitrust laws. In some of the countries in which we operate, such practices may be the custom or expected, and our competitors may undertake such practices, increasing the pressure on us and our employees. Our global operations expose us to the risk of violating, or being accused of violating, the foregoing or other anti-corruption laws. Such violations could be punishable by criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions and debarment from government contracts, as well as other remedial measures. Investigations of alleged violations can be very expensive and disruptive. In addition, some jurisdictions in which we operate also have anti-corruption laws in place that specifically address interactions with healthcare professionals. For example, in the U.S., the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Violations are subject to potential criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in the programs. Claims for payment in violation of the antikickback statute are also subject to the federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent. Many states have analogous state laws applicable to their Medicaid programs and in some cases, private health insurance. Similarly, German criminal law (Sec. 299a and 299b of the German Criminal Code, StGB) specifically addresses corruption in the health care sector. Essentially, the acceptance or grant of a benefit (which does not necessarily have to be a direct payment of money) in exchange for a healthcare professional giving undue preference to the products of a specific producer is criminally sanctioned. Our interactions with healthcare professionals are subject to these restrictions. Any failure to comply with applicable restrictions on interactions with healthcare professionals could subject us to fines and criminal liability and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We maintain and regularly update a group-wide compliance management system, which provides a structure to identify and mitigate potential compliance risks, including certain policies and procedures. Certain of our employees have taken and may in the future, take actions in violation of our policies and procedures (or otherwise in violation of the relevant anti-corruption laws, anti-money laundering laws and sanctions regulations). There can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will be sufficient in preventing such instances or that we will not ultimately be held responsible for violations of applicable anti-corruption and sanctions regulations by our employees, directors, managers, officers, partners, agents and service providers. Violations of anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations could lead to financial penalties being imposed on us, limits being placed on our activities, authorizations or licenses being revoked, damage to our reputation and other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Furthermore, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management. In addition, litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-corruption laws or sanctions regulations could be costly. We cannot guarantee that our compliance and internal controls will protect us against actions taken by our officers, managers, directors, employees and agents that might be determined to be in violation of law.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

The United States and other governments and their agencies impose sanctions and embargoes on certain countries, their governments, and designated parties. For example, in the United States the economic and trade sanctions programs are principally administered and enforced by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). Currently, OFAC maintains comprehensive trade and economic sanctions against certain countries and territories such as the Crimea region of the Ukraine, Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Syria, among others. Furthermore, there are U.S. and EU targeted sanctions against Russia. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that our compliance policies will effectively prevent violations, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. We also manufacture certain products for the defense industry which are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of State under its International Traffic in Arms regulations (“ITAR”) as well as European and other equivalent arms control regulations. In addition, we also manufacture certain commercial or dual-use products that are subject to export restrictions under the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) administered by the U.S. Commerce Department. Sanctions, trade restrictions and export controls particularly focus on such defense and dual use related products, which are subject to the ITAR and other arms control regulations. If our defense and dual use related products were found to be directly or indirectly exported to countries which are subject to trade restrictions and sanctions, or exported to any destination without required ITAR or other export licenses, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other costs and measures and could lose key customer relationships in the defense industry. In addition, materials and products imported into the European Union, the United States and other countries are subject to import duties. While we have implemented internal measures to comply with applicable customs regulations and to properly calculate the import duties applicable to imported products, customs authorities may disagree with our claimed tariff treatment for certain products, resulting in unexpected costs that may not have been factored into the sales price of such products and our expected margins. In addition, we cannot predict whether future domestic and foreign laws, regulations, or specific or broad trade remedy actions, or international agreements may impose additional duties or other restrictions on the importation of products from one or more of our sourcing venues. Any such changes in legislation and government policy may have a material adverse effect on our business, including the imposition of tariffs on certain materials which could increase our product costs. For example, in recent periods, the US government has announced various import tariffs on goods imported from certain trade partners, such as the European Union and China, which have resulted and may continue to result in reciprocal tariffs on goods exported from the United States to such trade partners. Trade barriers and other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements around the world have the potential to decrease demand for our products, negatively impact suppliers and adversely impact the economies in which we operate. Trade barriers and other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements could increase the cost of materials and components used in certain of our products, which could in turn increase our cost of goods sold. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international sales and manufacturing operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. Future regulations could limit the countries in which some of our products may be manufactured or sold, or could restrict our access to, or increase the cost of obtaining, products from foreign sources.

On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew its membership in the European Union and on December 24, 2020, the European Union and United Kingdom announced that they had reached the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which was implemented on December 31, 2020 and entered into force provisionally on January 1, 2021 until its entry into force on May 1, 2021. Despite the implementation of the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, there remains significant uncertainty as to how the agreement will affect relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. For example, the Northern Ireland Protocol covering the special status of Northern Ireland remains controversial, and developments surrounding its application may affect businesses that conduct operations in both the United Kingdom and Ireland. While the EU and the United Kingdom agreed a comprehensive, zero-tariff, zero-quota -48 ----- free trade pursuant to the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the end of the transition period on that date has, among other things, led to increased customs, health and safety checks at the border, which has delayed and disrupted the movement of goods between the EU and the United Kingdom and may undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas, significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the EU and cause political and economic instability in other countries of the EU. Additionally, following the end of the transition period, the United Kingdom has ceased to be a member of the EU single market, which has ended the free movement of services and workers between the United Kingdom and the EU and may make it more difficult for our United Kingdom operations to do business with customers or suppliers that are based in the EU. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 3% of our revenue was generated with customers based in the United Kingdom, while our UK subsidiary employed 274 FTE personnel.

The departure of one or more countries from the Eurozone may lead to the imposition of exchange rate control laws. The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries could increase our exposure to changes in exchange rates and have negative effects on our existing relationships with our suppliers or customers, resulting in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely, or the threat of such dissolution, could lead to increased market volatility, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the euro would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments could adversely affect our operations. Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro and the potential re-introduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone could also have adverse consequences for us. Financial markets and the supply of credit may be negatively impacted by fears surrounding the sovereign debts and/or fiscal deficits of several countries in Europe, the possibility of further downgrading of or defaults on sovereign debt, concerns about a slowdown in growth in certain economies and uncertainties regarding the overall stability and sustainability of the euro given the economic and political circumstances in individual member states.

Such systems are vulnerable to a number of threats, such as equipment damage, deficient database design, power outages, software or hardware malfunctions, malicious hacking, physical damage to vital data centers computer virus infection and a range of other hardware, software and network problems. We have experienced temporary outages in our IT systems in the past. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrence or consequences of security threats or security breaches, they could result in reduced demand for our products, data breaches, information loss, make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products to our customers or distributors or to receive raw materials from suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain. While we have countermeasures in place to prevent malfunctions and interruptions, any such malfunctions or interruptions could compromise the operational integrity of these systems and networks should our countermeasures fail in the future. There can be no assurance that the internal controls, which we have designed to restrict access to our information technology systems will prevent unauthorized access through cyber-attacks, theft and other security breaches. We also rely on systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, suppliers, employees and others. Our systems, websites, data (wherever stored), software or networks, and those of third parties (including data centers), are vulnerable to security breaches, including unauthorized access (from within our organization or by third parties), computer viruses or other malicious code and other cyber threats that could have a security impact. We may not be able to anticipate evolving techniques used to effect security breaches (which change frequently and may not be known until launched), or prevent attacks by hackers, including phishing or other cyber-attacks, or prevent breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, in a timely manner, or at all.

Failure to effectively prevent, detect and remediate security breaches, including attacks on our IT infrastructure by hackers, viruses, employee error or misconduct, or other disruptions could seriously harm our operations and the operations of our customers. Such breaches may result, among other things, in unauthorized access to trade secrets, confidential business information and personal information, data losses, business interruptions, non-compliance with legal requirements, legal claims or proceedings, deterioration in customer relationships and reputational harm. In addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of security threats, we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident, and the cost and operational expense of implementing, maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly. While we regularly review our network security, backup and disaster recovery, enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data, security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis. In addition, our information technology system needs regular upgrading to accommodate expansion of our business and maintain the efficiency of our operations. If we face a breakdown in our system, we could experience significant business and operational delays across our businesses.

Our due diligence reviews of our acquisition targets may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost or potential loss contingencies with respect to a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation and other liabilities. We also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in managing strategic investments, and integrations of acquired entities could change our relations with employees, customers and suppliers. Additionally, we may not achieve the benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction, including any expected synergies, in the amount or timeframe anticipated.

The assets and liabilities of the plans must be valued from time to time under applicable funding rules and as a result we may be required to increase the cash payments we make in relation to these defined benefit pension plans. We could also be required in some jurisdictions, as a result of the Transactions or at any time in the future, to make accelerated payments up to the full buy-out deficit in our defined benefit pension plans, which would likely be far higher than the normal ongoing funding cost of the plans. For example, we operate a defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom, for the benefit of certain employees and former employees of the Group in the UK (the “UK Scheme”). According to preliminary results for the most recent actuarial valuation of the UK Scheme, as at April 1, 2020, the UK Scheme has assets of £6.9 million and technical provisions for £10.7 million, with a consequent funding shortfall of approximately £3.8 million (€4.4 million equivalent) on a technical provision basis. According to the current schedule of contributions and recovery plan, we undertook to contribute approximately £34,000 to the UK Scheme on a monthly basis, until March 31, 2027, in order to meet the shortfall and cover related administration expenses and statutory levy payments. Our cash flows may be negatively impacted to the extent that we are required to make any additional payments to any relevant defined benefit pension plans in excess of the amounts assumed in our current projections and assumptions or report higher pension plan expenses under relevant accounting rules. Moreover, in certain jurisdictions pension regulators and authorities may be granted expensive powers that may be exercised in connection with the completion of M&A transactions, including the Transactions. For example, the UK Pensions Regulator has powers to impose contributions to a UK defined benefit pension scheme, or to put in place arrangements for the financial support of the pension scheme, including, but not limited to, requirements to provide additional security in support of such scheme. The new UK Pension Schemes Act 2021, which came into force in October 2021, may also significantly impact future corporate activity of entities with a UK defined benefit pension scheme. The new legislation provides for new criminal offences targeting “risking accrued scheme benefits” and the “avoidance of employer debt”, which may be interpreted as to include ordinary corporate activity in certain circumstances. Moreover, the new legislation introduces wider powers for the UK Pensions Regulator to intervene in corporate activity (including acquisitions and internal restructurings), and new requirements to give advance notification of certain corporate activity and to provide statements to the UK Pensions Regulator, which may require the input of the pension scheme trustee, with regard to the expected impact of such activity on the pension scheme. Furthermore, we could be subject to further payment obligations, if any of our former pension plans (for Germany and the United States) were not terminated properly in the past. In such case, employees could claim that further pension entitlements accrued under these plans. In addition, there could be unknown liabilities for prior periods under such plans, that we are not aware of and thus do not show in our financial statements. Any such additional obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.38,We may be exposed to tax risks in connection with our operating activities.,"The Group is subject to complex tax laws. Changes in tax laws could adversely affect the Group’s tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. The Group often relies on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. There cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with the Group’s interpretation of these laws. If the Group’s tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require the Group to pay taxes that the Group currently does not collect or pay or increase the costs of the Group’s services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase the Group’s costs of operations or the Group’s effective tax rate and have a negative effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. -51 ----- Due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to income and other taxes in multiple jurisdictions. Significant judgement and estimation are required in determining our calculation and provision for income, sales, value-add and other taxes, including withholding taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, we take advantage of our international network and centralize our strategic functions. In particular, we transfer and provide goods and services among the companies of the Group by adopting a tax-transfer frame model for the billing of intercompany services. There is a risk that tax authorities in individual countries assess the relevant transfer prices differently from our tax-transfer pricing model and address retroactive tax claims against one of our companies. Possible non-recognition of transfer prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we are regularly subject to tax audits by German tax authorities and tax authorities of certain other jurisdictions, which may raise claims against us for failure to comply with applicable tax laws. For example, our German subsidiaries have been subject to a general tax audit for the periods up to 2018. Final tax assessment notices were issued in 2021, and resulted in substantial changes to our tax declarations. While we appealed the assessment notices, we have recorded total provisions for tax-related disputes under other liabilities in an amount of €3.2 million as of December 31, 2020 to cover the estimated resulting risk. In addition, the tax authorities of certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate might consider activities by an entity of the Group, which is not legally domiciled in such jurisdiction, as a “permanent establishment” in such jurisdiction. This determination could result in potential adverse tax consequences, such as additional tax obligations and liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any such tax audits or reviews could differ from our tax provisions and accruals and any additional tax liabilities resulting from such final determination or any interest or any penalties or any regulatory, administrative or other sanctions relating thereto could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, certain members of the Target Group were in the past or are currently part of fiscal unities, tax groups and other tax consolidation schemes. We cannot ensure that these entities will not be held liable for unpaid taxes of the members of such tax consolidation schemes (including members outside of our Group) under statutory law or the contracts which formed or form the basis for the tax consolidation schemes. Furthermore, should such tax consolidation schemes not be accepted by the tax authorities and/or a tax court, taxes, interest and penalties may be imposed against entities of our group. Such liabilities may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials and environmental factors. If problems are severe, we may be forced to temporarily suspend all or part of our production until the problems are rectified. Any of this is likely to result in increased costs, lost sales, damage to customer relations, failure to perform existing contracts, time spent investigating the cause, remedial costs and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. In addition, where problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, we may be forced to recall the product from the market.

The protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to us. Customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information from cyberattack or other security breaches. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits. We are also subject to and must comply with complex and evolving European, U.S. and other foreign laws and regulations including the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”) regarding privacy, data protection and other related matters. Such laws govern our ability to collect, use and transfer personal data, including relating to consumers and business partners, as well as any such data relating to employees and others. These laws and rules also impose certain standards of protection and safeguarding on our ability to collect and use personal information relating to customers and potential customers, and could make us liable in the event of a loss of control of such data or as a result of unauthorized third-party access. We transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means and therefore rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of such information in line with regulatory requirements. Unauthorized data disclosure could occur through cyber security breaches as a result of human error, external hacking, malware infection, malicious or accidental user activity, internal security breaches, and physical security breaches due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access. We are exposed to the risk that data -52 ----- could be wrongfully appropriated, lost or disclosed, damaged or processed in breach of privacy or data protection laws which could lead to the imposition of fines or regulatory action, together with associated negative publicity. For example, breaches of the GDPR can result in significant fines based on percentages of our annual global turnover. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach or attack, whether actual or perceived, could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. In the past, we have been required to report a data breach to the relevant competent authority. It cannot be ruled out that we will, in the future, be subject to additional assessments or specific requests. If this were the case and we were not able to adapt promptly to the requests by the authorities and/or fail to comply with the measures required by them, we could be subject to sanctions that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers reduce our ability to attract and retain customers and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.

Accordingly, a significant portion of our sales, expenses, assets and liabilities are in currencies other than the euro, our reporting currency, and as such our results are subject to foreign exchange translation and transaction risks. Our primary foreign exchange rate risks relate to the U.S. dollar, the Chinese yuan, the British pound sterling, the Swiss Franc, the Polish zloty and the Czech koruna. Transactional risk arises when we and our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than our functional currency. To the extent that we incur expenses in one currency but generate sales in another, any change in the values of those non-euro currencies relative to euro could cause our profits to decrease or our products to be less competitive than those of our competitors. To the extent that cash and receivables that are denominated in currencies other than the euro are greater or less than our liabilities denominated in such non-euro currencies, we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations and movements in the foreign exchange markets. Where we are unable to match sales and receivables denominated in foreign currencies with expenses and liabilities denominated in the same currency, our results of operations are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, currency risk arises in connection with the translation of the financial condition and results of operations of our international subsidiaries with non-euro reporting currencies.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. At the respective maturities of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial position and results of operations.

The German interest barrier rules generally provide for a limitation on the deduction of net interest expenses in excess of 30% of tax adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of the interest barrier rules, all entities that are part of the same fiscal unity (Organschaft) for corporate income and trade tax purposes are treated as one single business. Any non-deductible amount exceeding the threshold of 30% is carried forward and may be, again subject to the interest barrier rules, deductible in future financial years. Any interest carryforward may be forfeited in part or in full in connection with certain measures, such as a change of the ownership structure. Upon closing of the Acquisition, certain Group companies, in particular in Germany, may forfeit their existing interest carryforwards on the Acquisition Closing Date. Furthermore, on June 20, 2016, the Council of the European Union adopted the Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (ATAD I) laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive contains five legally binding anti abuse measures, which member states are generally required to apply against common forms of aggressive tax planning since January 1, 2019. Part of the package of measures is the implementation of an interest limitation in line with German rules. The restriction of the deductibility of interest expenses for tax purposes may have adverse consequences for our financial position and results of operations. The Council of the European Union has also adopted Directive (EU) 2017/952 (ATAD II) targeting mismatches . End of June 2021, the German legislator passed the ATAD Implementation Act (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Anti-Steuervermeidungsrichtline, “ATADUmsG”) in order to implement the respective changes into German tax law. Amongst others, the ATADUmsG has introduced provisions to counter tax shortfalls due to mismatches from the use of hybrid financial instruments or hybrid entities or due to dual tax residency and has amended the CFC rules. These new rules may result in higher taxable income and a higher tax burden for corporate income tax and trade tax purposes in the current and future tax periods. Further measures may follow as part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project. In addition, certain of our German subsidiaries have considerable tax loss carryforwards which have partially been capitalized as deferred tax assets in our Financial Statements. The use of such existing tax loss carryforwards and ongoing losses for German corporate income and trade tax purposes may be forfeited in case of a direct or indirect transfer of shares, subject to certain limited exceptions. Such restriction, applying to both corporate income and trade tax, depends on the percentage of share capital or voting rights transferred within a five year period to one acquirer or person(s) closely related to the acquirer or a group of acquirers with a common interest. Under current rules, if more than 50% of the share capital or voting rights are transferred to such an acquirer, tax loss carryforwards and current losses will be forfeited to the extent no exception from the general forfeiture rules can be applied, such as the built-in gains exemption pursuant to which tax loss carryforwards survive to the extent taxable built-in gains are available at the level of the loss-carrying entity. To the extent that the utilization of tax losses is restricted, they cannot be set off against future tax profits which would result in higher future tax burdens compared to the situation in which tax loss carryforwards can be used to lower the actual tax burden on profits. Such restriction may require a write down of the deferred tax assets in our consolidated financial statements and would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Furthermore, upon the creation of a fiscal unity for German corporate and trade tax purposes, any tax loss carryforwards and interest carry forwards for German corporate income and trade tax purposes of a subsidiary, which have been incurred before the creation of the fiscal unity, will be excluded from use for the duration of the fiscal unity.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Such debt includes their obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Although the Indenture will contain restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and rank senior to the Note Guarantees. Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Guarantor under the Indenture in respect of an insolvency event, the holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets of such Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such Note Guarantee.

Although the pledge over the shares of the Issuer will secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees on a first-priority basis and will not secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, such pledge may secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes, to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the value of the Collateral securing the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral will be applied in repayment of any Super Senior Liabilities (to the extent the Designation Date has occurred), followed by (or unless the Designation Date has not occurred) any lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, among others, before repayment of the Notes and Note Guarantees. To the extent the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, those claims will generally rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior debt ranking pari passu with the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

In the event of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes including due to the reasons described in the preceding sentence. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such Collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Germany, include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Transaction Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by the Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, which may leave little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets.

The ability of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.","The security interests that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees thereof (including the Escrow Charge) will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the respective Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Transaction Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Transaction Security Documents except through the relevant Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, including as may be provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral (excluding the Escrow Charge) will be subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over such Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, including Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the relevant Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the relevant Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including in Germany, and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral.

Under German law, the creation of a valid security interest under a German law governed pledge agreement in relation to certain assets (such as bank accounts) may be subject to the delivery of a notice of pledge by the security agent or the security provider to a third party (for example, the notice of pledge to the account bank in case of a pledge over bank accounts). Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral.

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Germany and the entities expected to provide Notes Guarantees are organized under the laws of Germany and the United States. With respect to the Issuer and any Guarantor organized under the laws of a member state of the European Union, there is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (recast) is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In addition, the Collateral will include a pledge over the shares in the Issuer and Bidco, which are entities organized under the laws of Germany, and security interests in certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer. The insolvency laws of other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Note Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such security provider; - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers under the Transaction Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital _maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ -65 ----- In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the Guarantor or security provider: - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Note Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Note Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute; or - its liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets, unless it has a positive going concern prognosis. Although we believe that both the Issuer and the Guarantors are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

Enforcement of the obligations under a Note Guarantee against, and/or any Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor or providers of collateral will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors or managers of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. -66 ----- The Note Guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit _beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) or a partnership with a GmbH as liable partner (i.e., a “GmbH & Co. KG”) for the purpose_ of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or indirect shareholders or a subsidiary of such shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of such GmbH) are considered to constitute a benefit for such shareholder and therefore are subject to certain capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any Note Guarantees and/or security interests provided by a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG will be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the Indenture (or any other document under which any Note Guarantee is granted) and that are or will be contained in the Transaction Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws. Certain of the Collateral granted by a Guarantor incorporated as a German GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG will be subject to “limitation language.” Any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH or any other entity incorporated/established under the laws of Germany (including Bidco) may be held invalid pursuant to Section 138 BGB and would therefore not be enforceable if, at the time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security interest, among others, the third party creditor and the affiliate have acted in fraudulent conveyance (kollusives Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of the GmbH or other third party creditors of the GmbH. These principles apply mutatis mutandis to a GmbH & Co. KG. As a result, the Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider.

In these markets, we primarily focus on ceramic components for hip joint prostheses, such as ball heads and cup inserts used in hip replacement procedures. We believe that practitioners recognize our HPC components for medical implants, namely in hips, as a superior solution with proven benefits versus other materials such as metal alloys of cobalt and chrome. As a result, ceramic materials are replacing traditional materials for hip joint prosthetic components such as metal which have documented safety concerns and can trigger physical reactions in patients including, for example, allergic reactions resulting from metal sensitivity. In particular, HPC components are not only highly biocompatible, but also extremely wear resistant and durable and thus, have the ability to improve patients’ lives through appropriate immunological response, corrosion resistance, infection prevention, lowest wear of all bearings and best clinical outcomes. Consequently, ceramics penetration in global medical implant markets is steadily rising leading to increased growth for our ceramic components. More than 20 million of our BIOLOX[®] ceramic components have been implanted in patients globally as of the date of this offering memorandum. We estimate that nearly one in two hip joint implant systems sold worldwide includes at least one ceramic component. Our customers are orthopedic implant OEMs, including the top orthopedic implant OEMs who together have a strong presence in the global hip implant market. We believe that our BIOLOX[®] brand has come to symbolize high quality and innovation and is increasingly preferred by surgeons and other medical professionals. We believe that in the future, the superior characteristics of ceramic materials will drive the rapidly growing market for dental implants, in which we have been active for many years and are further ramping up our presence with our DENSILOX[®] and ZERAMEX[®] brands. The penetration of ceramics in the dental implants market is rapidly increasing from a low starting point (according to a leading international consultancy firm, the ceramic share in the dental implant market in the US and EU-5 was equal to 7% in 2019) as patients not only become more focused on aesthetics and biocompatible implants, but also as new product innovations have closed the gap with titanium implants in terms of product quality, primarily relating to wearability and longevity. Since 2020, our HPC solutions have been used for spine disc implants and, over the coming years, we expect to bring our BIOLOX[®] technology to more orthopedic applications, such as implants for knee and shoulder. We also have a strong presence in ceramic solutions for medical equipment markets, including medical glove formers. In particular, we focus on ultrasound equipment, flow sensors, disposable medical glove formers and other applications in the medical field such as hermetic products for medical, pharmaceutical or laboratory environments.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Throughout our R&D activities, we closely collaborate with customers during the entire development and commercialization cycle of our products and become embedded within our customers’ innovation processes by offering value-added solutions. Within the last five years, we have introduced many new products including key innovations in areas of new materials and processes as well as new medical solutions, such as BIOLOX CONTOURA[®], a new generation of licensed ball heads cleared for marketing by certain of our customers by the U.S. Food and Drug -76 ----- Administration (“FDA”) for use in certain prosthetic hip replacements without bone cement, and a ceramic core for the Simplify[®]Disc spinal disc implant by Simplify Medical (now part of the NuVasive group). Simplify[®]Disc received FDA approval for use in certain 1-level implants in 2020, and approval for use in certain 2-level implants in 2021. Although 63.6% of our revenue was generated from customers based in Europe for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, 19.7% of which was generated with customers based in Germany, we have a global infrastructure with production facilities in 11 countries across Europe, North America, Asia and South America, and over 3,400 full-time equivalent (“FTE”) employees as of September 30, 2021. Further, many of our customers have a strong export-focus which positions us as a company with a global sales footprint. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, we generated revenue of €629.4 million. The Issuer’s Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 was €275.9 million.

We experienced decreased volumes as non-essential surgeries were postponed and customers had to cancel orders or shift delivery dates given the lower demand from clinics. Performance in the Industrials markets has been impacted by the global industrial down-cycle since 2019 that was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also experienced COVID-19 related involuntary plant closures, which negatively impacted revenue and EBITDA during 2020. As a result, revenue decreased by 22.8% from the first quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2020. During 2020, however, revenues from medical equipment markets were supported by a spike in market growth for our ceramic formers used in manufacturing disposable medical gloves and by sales of components for COVID-19 test kits in the second half of 2020. Overall, we experienced a decrease in revenue of 10.9% in 2020 as compared to 2019. Despite the revenue decline, our cash flow from operating activities was €163.4 million in 2020 as compared to €190.1 million in 2019. Our EBITDA margins also remained resilient in 2020 as we continued to implement various cost optimization measures. We started numerous initiatives in February 2019 to streamline our organization and focus on an Industrials market-based approach, with the aim of reducing organizational complexity and overhead costs. In addition, following the outbreak of COVID-19, we deployed further cost reduction measures including multiple employee lay-offs, and the decrease or postponement of investing outflows and capital expenditures with regard to non-essential projects. We also used short-time work for certain periods in 2020 and to a lesser degree in 2021, which significantly reduced our costs per fulltime-equivalent employee in 2020. We expect that costs will increase in 2021, partially due to the reduction of short-time work benefits. We also deferred UK VAT due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also received government support of €1.1 million mainly comprised of short-time work related social security contributions in 2020. Since the third quarter of 2020, we have begun to experience pre-pandemic rates of growth. Our revenue in the first quarter of 2021 were approximately 2% higher than in the first quarter of 2019 and approximately 5% higher in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2019. The strong performance in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflects surgery volumes recovering to pre-pandemic levels in most regions, key customers re-stocking and increasing orders following postponements and cancellations, and further strong ceramic penetration momentum. Year-to-date trading is benefitting from post-COVID-19 tailwinds as the result of key customers restocking and increasing orders following postponements and cancellations in 2020. In 2021, our business has experienced a clear recovery, as revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 has increased by approximately 4.3% as compared to the same period in 2019. Our continued post-COVID-19 normalization has been further supported by a strong order book in 2021. Order intake in the first nine months of 2021 was higher than the equivalent periods in 2019 and 2020 and the order book in September 2021 has substantially increased as compared to our order book as of September 30, 2019 and 2020. As a result of the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, the comparability of our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020 with the relevant corresponding periods in 2019 and the comparability with future periods may be limited.

BIOLOX[®] is our key brand and product line for our orthopedics business, and we believe hip implant systems containing our BIOLOX[®] components have become the product of choice for surgeons around the globe. The cost of our HPC components (both ball heads and cup inserts) included in a complete hip joint implant system represents a small part of the overall costs of the total system, but are critical to the performance of these products and therefore our customers are less sensitive to the cost of such components. We have a longstanding relationship with key hip replacement implant OEMs, including the top orthopedic implant OEMs who together have a strong presence in the global hip implant market. Our ceramic components (both ball heads and cup inserts) are critical to the overall performance of their hip implant systems. We also collaborate with our OEM customers to assist them in reaching end-users and key decision makers, which we believe has contributed to our high level of brand loyalty, characterized by a high contract renewal rate, with very low customer churn. We believe that our strategic relationship with each of the top orthopedic implant OEMs as well as with many other customers is key to our strong position in the ceramic hip replacement components market and demand from each of these customers has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, a major driver of revenue from the Medical markets.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

(1) On average, more than 80% of our total ceramic hip implant components sold in the last five years were ball heads. This is principally due to the lower share of the total hip implant market of ceramic-on-ceramic components compared to ceramic-on-polyethylene components. 78 ----- According to a leading international consultancy firm, the total market for hip implant components is estimated to be approximately €600 million, which includes an approximately €270 million addressable market for ceramic hip implants. The total addressable market is expected to grow based on continuously growing increase in the total number of hip replacement procedures, which represents a key driver of demand for ceramic ball heads and inserts. Further, ceramic as a material is increasingly used in revisions and partial hip replacement. In developed markets such as Europe and the United States, growth in the artificial hip joint market is primarily driven by an aging population as well as by an increase in obesity rates. Both age and obesity are significant contributors to hip joint problems. Additionally, there are indications that the younger population, those who are less than 65 years old, are electing to have primary hip replacements earlier in life so that they can maintain and enjoy an active lifestyle. Such younger patients are taking advantage of improvements in technology leading to better wearability and increased life spans of hip implant prostheses. Similarly, growth in artificial hip joints in emerging markets also stems from an aging population and, in some countries, increased obesity. However, in developing countries there are additional drivers of growth, such as the rise in cases of osteoarthritis and osteonecrosis (reduced blood flow to bones), improved availability of medical care and prosthetic procedures coupled with increased household incomes and broader access to funded healthcare.

In addition, due to the large number of niche markets in which we operate, the effect of economic downturns in our target geographic markets has in the past been partially offset by the various different developments in Industrials markets, as demonstrated by our ability to quickly rebound from two global economic crises. Medical end-markets are typically more profitable and less susceptible to the economic cycles. As a consequence, our profitability and cash generation is more resilient and less affected by negative developments in the economies of our target markets than our overall revenue.

Medical markets revenue consists of revenue from the Medical business as reported in the Financial Statements plus revenue from medical equipment markets. In our Financial Statements, revenue from medical equipment markets was included in our Industrials business revenue. We present revenue based on end-market in this offering memorandum as we believe it is more consistent with our market-based approach to our business. Revenue was €495.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of €76.7 million, or 18.3%, as compared to €418.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was mainly due to higher revenue volumes in both our key end-markets. The Medical markets experienced a particularly strong recovery in 2021 from the impact of COVID-19 in 2020, driving this growth over-proportionally. Medical markets revenue was €240.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of €38.2 million or 18.9%, including the contribution of Dentalpoint AG, whereas organic growth was approximately 16.3%. This increase was mainly due to recovery from lower revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, which have been impacted by decreased order income, order cancellations and postponements from customers, in the context of a lower number of elective surgeries taking place due to the outbreak of COVID-19. We now benefit from growing demand in China and from our top Medical markets customers, with recovery in Europe being slower due to protracted impact of COVID-19. Industrials markets revenue was €254.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of €38.7 million or 17.9%, as compared to €215.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was mainly due to strong recovery from lower revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, which have been impacted by lower demand from customers and order cancellations as a consequence of the outbreak of COVID-19. We now benefit from a significant rebound in economic activity in all our key end-markets, as well as a strong order book as a result of our revamped customer-centric go-to-market strategy in the Industrials markets.

Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items, our Adjusted cost of sales increased by €24.7 million, or 12.1%, from €205.0 million representing 49.0% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to €229.7 million representing 46.4% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This increase was mainly due to increased material, personnel and packing costs as a result of the increased sales volumes in both business. The improvement of our margin was driven by operating leverage as well as productivity improvements and product mix. Gross profit was €219.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of €52.9 million or 31.7%, as compared to €167.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items, our Adjusted gross profit margin increased by 2.6 percentage points to 53.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from 51.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was mainly due to higher sales in both businesses as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic began to reverse, more efficient utilization of our facilities, significant productivity improvements, an improved cost structure and positive customer and product mix. These positive effects were partially offset by the discontinuation of short-time work. _Selling costs_ Selling costs were €72.8 million (representing 14.7% of total revenue) for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of €7.0 million or 10.7%, as compared to €65.8 million (representing 15.7% of total revenue) for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items, our Adjusted selling costs increased by €4.2 million, or 15.5%, to €31.4 million representing 6.3% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €27.1 million representing 6.5% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase, which was less than our the increase to sales growth during the period, was mainly due to economies of scale, continued stringent cost control activities and improved efficiency in certain key processes. _Research and development costs_ Research and development costs were €17.0 million (representing 3.4% of total revenue) for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of €1.4 million or 8.9%, as compared to €15.6 million (representing 3.7% of revenue) for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was mainly due to amortization, depreciation and non-recurring items. Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items, our Adjusted research and development costs increased by €0.4 million, or 3.0%, to €13.6 million representing 2.7% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €13.2 million representing 3.2% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to a more focused approach to our development activities (including through a streamlined organization) and the funding of selected special projects in 2020. Despite the abovementioned decrease, we maintain our commitment to invest in the development of new medical products, customer driven innovation in the Industrials markets, and to support selected strategic projects. _General administrative costs_ General administrative costs were €19.1 million (representing 3.9% of revenue) for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of €1.4 million or 7.8%, as compared to €17.7 million (representing 4.2% of revenue) for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was mainly due to increased volumes, amortization, depreciation and non-recurring items. Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items, our Adjusted general administrative costs increased by €1.2 million, or 9.0%, to €14.5 million representing 2.9% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from €13.3 million representing 3.2% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and remained broadly unchanged as a percentage of revenue. -85 ----- _Other income and expenses, net_ Other income was €3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of €139.6 million, or 102.3%, as compared to other expenses of €136.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was mainly due to impairment effects on goodwill in 2020. Excluding non-recurring items, our Adjusted Other income and expenses, net, decreased by €2.7 million, or 71.1%, to €1.1 million representing 0.2% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €3.8 million representing 0.9% of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to higher other income derived from COVID-19-related adjustments, including additional costs for safety measures and shutdown costs for our facilities. _Interest income and other finance income_ Interest income and other finance income was €26.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of €23.7 million, or 984.1%, as compared to €2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was mainly due to €24.9 million gains from the fair value measurement of derivatives and to €1.1 million interest income from the effective interest method. _Interest expenses and other finance costs_ Interest expenses and other finance costs were €65.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, a decrease of €20.2 million, or 23.6%, as compared to €85.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to €28.0 million of losses resulting from the fair value measurement of derivatives for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Interest expenses and other finance costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, include €39.5 million of interest expense on the borrowings under the Existing Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Notes, €15.1 million of interest expenses from the Existing Shareholder Loan, €6.0 million expenses from unwinding the discount on financial liabilities, €3.0 million exchange rate losses and €1.6 million of other interest expenses. _Income tax benefit / (expense)_ Income tax expense was €24.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of €22.3 million, or 1,161.3%, as compared to an income tax expense of €1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was mainly due to lower deferred tax income resulting from the valuation of derivatives and higher current tax expenses mainly resulting from the consolidated tax group between Ceramtec BondCo and its German subsidiaries. _Net profit/(loss) for the period_ As a result of the developments described above, net profit for the period was €50.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of €204.3 million compared to a net loss of €153.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Medical markets revenue consists of revenue from the Medical business as reported in the Financial Statements plus revenue from medical equipment markets. In our Financial Statements, revenue from medical equipment markets was included in our Industrials business revenue. We present revenue based on end-market in this offering memorandum as we believe it is more consistent with our market-based approach to our business. Revenue was €552.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of €67.7 million, or 10.9%, as compared to €620.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to the decrease in revenue in both our businesses. Medical markets revenue was €265.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of €17.3 million, or 6.1%, as compared to €282.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to lower order income and order cancellations as well as postponements from customers in the context of a decreased level of elective surgeries taking place due to the outbreak of COVID-19, partly offset by our performance in medical equipment markets. Industrials markets revenue was €287.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of €50.4 million, or 14.9%, as compared to €338.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to lower demand from customers and order cancellations as a consequence of the outbreak of COVID-19, as well as to generally slowing markets for mobility and electronic components even before the outbreak of COVID-19. The impact from the abovementioned factors was partly offset by a growth in volumes for piezo ceramics employed for sensors in different end-markets.

This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in sales as a result of postponed or cancelled orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in personnel expenses related to a reduction of the overall number of employed FTE, and the use of short-time work. Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items such as additional contribution to a pension fund, consulting costs and severance payments, our Adjusted cost of sales decreased by €20.5 million, or 7.0%, from €293.5 million representing 47.3% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €273.0 million representing 49.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to the reasons described above. Gross profit was €217.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of €46.3 million or 17.5%, as compared to €264.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items, our Adjusted gross profit margin decreased by 2.1 percentage points to 50.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 52.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to decreases in sales as a result of the economic slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting under-utilization rate of our facilities. _Selling costs_ Selling costs were €87.3 million (representing 15.8% of total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of €8.0 million, or 8.3%, as compared to €95.2 million (representing 15.4% of total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items such as non-recurring litigation costs, additional contribution to a pension fund, consulting costs and severance payments, our Adjusted selling costs decreased by €7.8 million, or 18.1%, to €35.4 million representing 6.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €43.2 million representing 6.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to decreases in sales as a result of the economic slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic and cost-savings measures implemented as a result thereof. _Research and development costs_ Research and development costs were €20.6 million (representing 3.7% of total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of €2.7 million, or 11.6%, as compared to €23.3 million (representing 3.8% of total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items such as additional contribution to a pension fund and severance payments, our Adjusted research and development costs decreased by €2.7 million, or 13.4%, to €17.4 million representing 3.1% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €22.4 million representing 4.5% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to decreases in projects as a result of the slowdown in the industrial cycle related to the COVID-19 pandemic and more careful management of project costs. _General administrative costs_ General administrative costs were €24.5 million (representing 4.4% of total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of €2.6 million or 9.6%, as compared to €27.1 million (representing 4.4% of total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items such as acquisition consulting and severance payments, our Adjusted general administrative costs decreased by €0.4 million, or 2.2%, to €18.1 million representing 3.3% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €18.5 million representing 3.0% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to decreases in sales as a result of the economic slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic and cost-savings measures implemented as a result thereof. _Other income and expenses, net_ Other expenses were €139.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of €203.9 million, or 59.5%, as compared to other expenses of €342.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to lower impairment in 2020 as compared to 2019. In 2019, we recognized impairment losses of €329.8 million with regard to goodwill. Excluding non-recurring items such as impairment expenses, transaction-related expenses and foreign exchange effects, our Adjusted Other income, net, increased by €4.8 million to €4.2 million representing 0.8% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, from Adjusted Other expenses, net, of €0.6 million representing 0.1% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due to COVID-19-related adjustments and discontinued operations items. _Interest income and other finance income_ Interest income and other finance income was €6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €4.7 million, or 220.8%, as compared to €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due to a higher exchange rate gains. -88 ----- _Interest expenses and other finance costs_ Interest expenses and other finance costs were €99.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of €0.9 million or 0.9%, as compared to €100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to higher interest expenses and losses on derivative valuations compensated by lower interest expenses from the Existing Shareholder Loan. Interest expenses and other finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, include €50.9 million in interest expense from the borrowings under the Existing Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Notes, €22.7 million losses on derivative valuations, €19.1 million in interest expenses from the Existing Shareholder Loan, €5.2 million in expenses from the effective interest rate method and €1.5 million in other interest expenses. _Income tax benefit / (expense)_ Income tax benefit / (expense) was an expense €2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of €13.7 million or 82.7%, as compared to an income tax expense of €16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to lower current tax expenses resulting from the consolidated tax group between CeramTec BondCo and its German subsidiaries combined with lower deferred tax income from purchase price allocation depreciation and higher tax expenses from the valuation of derivatives. _Net loss_ As a result of the developments described above, net loss for the period was €149.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of €190.1 million, or 56.0%, as compared to a net loss of €339.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

See “Presentation of Financial Information—Historical Financial Information—Comparability of the Financial Statements—The _Acquisition of CeramTec Holding GmbH in 2018” for further information._ (2) Medical markets revenue and Industrials markets revenue represent external revenue to third parties. Medical markets revenue consists of revenue from the Medical business as reported in the Financial Statements plus revenue from medical equipment markets. In our Financial Statements, revenue from medical equipment markets was included in our Industrials business revenue. We present revenue based on end-market in this offering memorandum as we believe it is more consistent with our market-based approach to our business. Revenue was €620.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €123.5 million or 24.8%, as compared to €496.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is primarily attributable to the statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018, only including the operations of the Target, CeramTec BondCo and CeramTec AcquiCo prior to the acquisition of CeramTec Holding by the Target on March 8, 2018. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from the year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis (including the results of CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries for the entire period) mainly due to higher Medical markets revenue volumes, partly offset by a slight decrease of Industrials markets revenue volumes. Medical markets revenue was €282.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €76.8 million, or 37.5%, as compared to €205.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Medical markets revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from the year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis (including the results of CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries for the entire period) mainly due to a volume increase in ball-heads and inserts. Industrials markets revenue was €338.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €46.5 million or 16.0%, as compared to €291.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is primarily attributable to the statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018, only including the operations of the Target, CeramTec BondCo and CeramTec AcquiCo prior to the acquisition of CeramTec Holding by the Target on March 8, 2018. Industrials markets revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased from the year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis (including the results of CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries for the entire period) mainly due to a general slowdown in the industrial cycle resulting in an overall softer demand in the electronics and mobility markets whereas revenue in 2018 benefitted from peak activity in the mobility industry. In addition, as part of a wider strategy to streamline our business, we discontinued certain product groups from our offering in 2018.

This increase is primarily attributable to the statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018 only including the operations of the Target, CeramTec BondCo and CeramTec AcquiCo prior to the acquisition of CeramTec Holding by the Target on March 8, 2018. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased from the year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis, including the results of CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries for the entire period. Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items such as additional contribution to pension fund, consulting costs and severance payments, our cost of sales increased due to higher sales volumes and a change in product mix. Gross profit was €264.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €103.8 million, or 64.8%, as compared to €160.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is primarily attributable to the statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018, only including the operations of the Target, CeramTec BondCo and CeramTec AcquiCo prior to the acquisition of CeramTec Holding by the Target on March 8, 2018. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from the year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis, including the results of CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries for the entire period. Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items, our gross profit margin slightly increased mainly due to higher sales, productivity improvements and economics of scale, partly offset by certain tariff increases. _Selling costs_ Selling costs were €95.2 million (representing 15.4% of total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €14.1 million or 17.4%, as compared to €81.1 million (representing 16.3% of total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is primarily attributable to the statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018, only including the operations of the Target, CeramTec BondCo and CeramTec AcquiCo prior to the acquisition of CeramTec Holding by the Target on March 8, 2018. Selling costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from the year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis, including the results of CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries for the entire period. Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items such as non-recurring litigation costs, additional contribution to pension fund, consulting costs and severance payments, our selling costs decreased due to more targeted marketing expenses and an overall improved cost structure. _Research and development costs_ Research and development costs were €23.3 million (representing 3.8% of total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €4.8 million, or 25.7%, as compared to €18.6 million (representing 3.7% of total revenue) -91 ----- for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is primarily attributable to the statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018, only including the operations of the Target, CeramTec BondCo and CeramTec AcquiCo prior to the acquisition of CeramTec Holding by the Target on March 8, 2018. Research and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from the year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis, including the results of CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries for the entire period. Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items such as additional contribution to pension fund and severance payments, our research and development costs decreased mainly due to more focused R&D approach and efficiency gains in our cost processes. _General administrative costs_ General administrative costs were €27.1 million (representing 4.4% of total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of €1.1 million, or 4.0%, as compared to €28.3 million (representing 5.7% of total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2018. General administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased from the year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis (including the results of CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries for the entire period) mainly due to non-recurring transaction related expenses and tighter cost discipline measures. Excluding amortization and depreciation and non-recurring items such as acquisition consulting and severance payments, our general administrative costs decreased due to economies of scale, cost discipline measures such as lower spend on travel and external consulting and the implementation of a market and customer-centric realignment of our operations focused on Industrials markets with positive effects being recorded starting from the second half of 2019. _Other income and expenses, net_ Other expenses were €342.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €331.7 million, or 2,964.5%, as compared to other expenses of €11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is primarily attributable to the statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018 only including the operations of the Target, CeramTec BondCo and CeramTec AcquiCo prior to the acquisition of CeramTec Holding by the Target on March 8, 2018. Other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from the year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis including the results of CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries for the entire period mainly due to higher impairment expenses in 2019, while other expenses in 2018 were primarily driven by transaction-related expenses. _Interest income and other finance income_ Interest income and other finance income was €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €0.5 million, or 31.3%, as compared to €1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to the sale of bonds with a nominal value of €5.0 million in December 2019, which resulted in a gain of €0.4 million. _Interest expenses and other finance costs_ Interest expenses and other finance costs were €100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of €24.6 million, or 19.7%, as compared to €125.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was mainly due to lower interest rate expenses and losses on derivative valuations. Interest expenses and other finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 include €53.4 million in interest expenses from the borrowings under the Existing Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Notes, €38.8 million in interest expenses from the Existing Shareholder Loan, €4.3 million in expenses from the effective interest rate method, €1.3 million in losses on derivative valuations and €2.8 million in other interest expenses. _Income tax benefit / (expense)_ Income tax expense was €16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €31.6 million, as compared to an income tax benefit of €15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to higher current tax expenses resulting from the consolidated tax group between Ceramtec Holding and its German subsidiaries combined with lower deferred tax income from purchase price allocation depreciation and higher tax expenses from the valuation of derivatives. _Net loss_ As a result of the developments described above, net loss was €339.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €252.1 million, or 289.4%, as compared to a net loss of €87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. -92 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

This increase was mainly due to group-wide sales increases, in particular from growth from our high-margin medical products, supported by further productivity improvements and solid product mix and cost management.

Our ability to generate cash from our operations depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors including those discussed in this section and the section entitled “Risk Factors.” Following the consummation of the Transactions, we expect that our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash flows from operations. In addition, there will be funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility that we may utilize to meet our future cash needs up to an amount of €250.0 million. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.” We introduced a number of early and comprehensive measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to safeguard our liquidity, including temporary cost controls related to travel and entertainment, curtailment of R&D spend and other measures. In particular, we received short-time working compensation (Kurzarbeitergeld) from the German federal employment agency and implemented measures aimed at reducing costs. We incurred certain costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including costs related to depreciation and other fixed costs related to the production facilities and costs related to illness rates and quarantines. In addition, we recorded an under-utilization of our factories and overhead functions. We also incurred other costs related to disinfecting production sites and offices and further measures, implemented to safeguard the health of our employees. We implemented a disciplined management of our working capital, and reduced our inventory levels through improved planning and monitoring while also temporarily reducing spend on capital expenditures for certain non-essential projects. -93 ----- We anticipate that we will be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate future financing cash flows will be limited by the Indenture and Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which may have important negative consequences for you. See “Risk Factors,” “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements.” Any additional indebtedness that we incur could reduce the amount of our cash flow available to_ make payments on our then existing indebtedness, including under the Notes offered hereby, and increase our leverage.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

As a result, given the impact of the acquisition of CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries, the statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018 is not directly comparable to the statement of comprehensive income for any subsequent period. See “Presentation of Financial Information—Historical Financial Information—Comparability of the Financial Statements—The _Acquisition of CeramTec Holding GmbH in 2018” for further information. Cash flows from operating activities_ Cash flows from operating activities increased by €49.7 million, or 48.8%, from an inflow of €101.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to an inflow of €151.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This increase was mainly due to overall stronger business performance, partly offset by increasing trade receivables driven by consistent volume growth. Cash flows from operating activities decreased by €26.7 million, or 14.0%, from an inflow of €190.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to an inflow of €163.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to overall weaker business performance in the context of the outbreak of COVID-19, partly offset by strong operative working capital management. Cash flows from operating activities increased by €79.3 million, or 71.6%, from an inflow of €110.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an inflow of €190.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily attributable to the statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 only including the operations of the Target, CeramTec BondCo and CeramTec AcquiCo prior to the acquisition of CeramTec Holding by the Target on March 8, 2018. Cash flow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from the year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis including the results of CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries for the entire period mainly due to higher EBITDA in 2019, stronger working capital management and non-recurring one-time transaction expenses recorded in 2018. _Cash flows from investing activities_ Cash flows from investing activities increased by €48.9 million, or 182.3%, from an outflow of €26.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to an outflow of €75.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This increase was mainly due to the acquisition of Dentalpoint AG in January 2021 for a purchase price net of cash and cash equivalents taken over of €49.0 million in for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. -94 ----- Cash flows from investing activities decreased by €3.5 million, or 8.4%, from an outflow of €41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to an outflow of €37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to investing outflows being partly decreased or postponed with regard to non-essential projects as a consequence of the outbreak of COVID-19. Cash flows from investing activities for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets decreased by €2,452.3 million, or 98.4%, from an outflow of €2,493.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an outflow of €41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to the acquisition of the Group by BC Partners in 2018 for €2,479 million. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from the year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis including the results of CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries for the entire period mainly due to the acquisition of the Group by BC Partners in 2018 of €2,479 million. _Cash flows from financing activities_ Cash flows from financing activities decreased by €56.9 million, or 55.6%, from an outflow of €102.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to an outflow of €45.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This decrease was mainly due to higher outflows in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 driven by the payment of the Existing Shareholder Loan in the amount of €19.6 million. Cash flows from financing activities changed by €160.8 million, or 151.8%, from an outflow of €106.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to an inflow of €54.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This change was mainly due to the drawing of a syndicated loan during 2020 with a cash inflow effect of €168.2 million, while €53.9 million of syndicated loans were repaid in 2019. Cash flows from financing activities changed by €2,509.5 million, or 104.4%, from an inflow of €2,403.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an outflow of €106.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change was mainly due to the financing of the acquisition of the Group by BC Partners in 2018. Cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased from the year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis including the results of CeramTec Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries for the entire period mainly due to financing of the acquisition of the Group by BC Partners in 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

In general, our capital investment is split evenly, between maintenance and growth projects. The lower investment spending in the year ended December 31, 2020 was mainly due to the partial reduction or postponement of capital investments as a consequence of the outbreak of COVID-19. The increased investment spending in the year ended December 31, 2019 was mainly driven by phasing of growth projects, which reflected the market conditions in 2019. Our annual capital expenditures have typically amounted to between 6% and 8%, of which approximately half has typically been related to maintenance and the half to growth. Given the lower level of capital expenditures in 2020, we would expect certain catch-up effects in 2021, which may be significant, and would bring the three-year average capital expenditures back in line with our typical level. Capital expenditures in 2021 were focused on growth projects aimed at ensuring our ability to manage a strong increase in order intake in addition to necessary maintenance (including, for example, capacity increase projects in our Medical markets and selected projects to enhance our digitalization and ESG capabilities). -95 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

In these markets, we primarily focus on ceramic components for hip joint prostheses, such as ball heads and cup inserts used in hip replacement procedures. We believe that practitioners recognize our HPC components for medical implants, namely in hips, as a superior solution with proven benefits versus other materials such as metal alloys of cobalt and chrome. As a result, ceramic materials are replacing traditional materials for hip joint prosthetic components such as metal which have documented safety concerns and can trigger physical reactions in patients including, for example, allergic reactions resulting from metal sensitivity. In particular, HPC components are not only highly biocompatible, but also extremely wear resistant and durable and thus, have the ability to improve patients’ lives through appropriate immunological response, corrosion resistance, infection prevention, lowest wear of all bearings and best clinical outcomes. Consequently, ceramics penetration in global medical implant markets is steadily rising leading to increased growth for our ceramic components. More than 20 million of our BIOLOX[®] ceramic components have been implanted in patients globally as of the date of this offering memorandum. We estimate that nearly one in two hip joint implant systems sold worldwide includes at least one ceramic component. Our customers are orthopedic implant OEMs, including the top orthopedic implant OEMs who together have a strong presence in the global hip implant market. We believe that our BIOLOX[®] brand has come to symbolize high quality and innovation and is increasingly preferred by surgeons and other medical professionals. We believe that in the future, the superior characteristics of ceramic materials will drive the rapidly growing market for dental implants, in which we have been active for many years and are further -100 ----- ramping up our presence with our DENSILOX[®] and ZERAMEX[®] brands. The penetration of ceramics in the dental implants market is rapidly increasing from a low starting point (according to a leading international consultancy firm, the ceramic share in the dental implant market in the US and EU-5 was equal to 7% in 2019) as patients not only become more focused on aesthetics and biocompatible implants, but also as new product innovations have closed the gap with titanium implants in terms of product quality, primarily relating to wearability and longevity. Since 2020, our HPC solutions have been used for spine disc implants and, over the coming years, we expect to bring our BIOLOX[®] technology to more orthopedic applications, such as implants for knee and shoulder. We also have a strong presence in ceramic solutions for medical equipment markets, including medical glove formers.

The global addressable orthopedics implant market, consisting of hip, spine, knee and shoulder and veterinarian orthopedic implants, amounted to €3.5 billion in 2019, and its growth is driven by an aging population, increasing life expectancy, increasing prevalence of overweight and chronic diseases, increasing access to healthcare, favorable demographics factors and increasing number of pet owners (for veterinarian implants), among others. Further, global growth in the hip total addressable market by volume of hip implant surgeries is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% from 2022 to 2026. We believe practitioners recognize our high performance ceramic components for medical implants as a superior solution with proven benefits and a superior clinical record as compared to other materials such as metal alloys of cobalt and chrome. As a result, ceramics penetration in global medical implant markets is steadily rising, leading to increased growth for our ceramic components. For example, in hip implants, the ceramic volume share of hip ball heads is expected to increase from approximately 47% in 2019 to approximately 58% in 2026, with a longer-term penetration potential of 100% and increasing penetration by 18% from 2016 to 2026, according to a leading international consultancy firm. The global addressable dental implant market is estimated to amount to €4.6 billion in 2019 and to grow at a CAGR of approximately 6% between 2022 and 2026 driven by an aging population, higher disposable income and increased aesthetic consciousness, with ceramic dental implant EU-5 and US markets growing at a CAGR of approximately 10% for the same period, according to a leading international consultancy firm, driven by an aging population, higher disposable income, and increasing awareness of dental aesthetics.

OEMs typically prefer suppliers with capacity to increase volumes, react flexibly to volume changes and sign longer-term contracts. We are also able to manage costs through our strong supplier base built up over a number of years. We believe our customers are highly loyal as we have a strong reputation with surgeons and care providers. In addition, our ceramic hip components represent only a small portion of the total price of an implant system for an OEM, typically comprising less than 10% of the overall cost, but are critical to the performance of these products. As a result, customers tend to be less sensitive to the cost of these components and primarily focused on quality. Ceramic hip components also have a high potential of being more cost-efficient over the course of their lifecycle than metal components due to their durability (regardless of the patient’s age) and other safety concerns. In addition, responsibility to bring a new device to the market typically lies with the OEM, as the marketing authorization is granted not for the component but for an entire hip implant system. This process requires substantial financial efforts and time since obtaining marketing authorization from regulators can take 18 months or longer for ceramic-on-polyethylene products or up to six years for ceramic-on-ceramic products across geographies. Therefore, replacing one part in a hip implant system could require new or additional regulatory authorizations or delay the regulatory review process, which incentivizes customers to use an established and proven product like ours. We also maintain a regulatory and quality team of over 50 people as of September 30, 2021, in an effort to ensure a smooth process and efficient assistance both to our customers and to our internal organization. Given the associated liability risks for OEMs in relation to any quality issues, we believe that OEMs prefer our well-trusted BIOLOX[®] brand to others. 102 ----- We actively engage in promoting our brand among key opinion leaders in the medical industry, including surgeons and hospitals by regularly organizing technical training sessions and attending medical seminars on clinical outcomes and material properties of ceramics.

We were subsequently taken over by Philipp Rosenthal & Co. AG in 1908 and, in 1921, commenced the development of technical ceramics products & solutions. In 1951, we opened our first factory in Plochingen. Through a series of combinations, the Group in substantially its current form was established in 1996, following the merger of ceramic company Cerasiv GmbH with Hoechst CeramTec AG. The Rockwood Group acquired the Target Group in 2004 from Metallgesellschaft AG. Subsequently, the private equity firm, Cinven acquired the Target Group from the Rockwood Group in 2013. In 2015, we accelerated our growth by completing the 108 ----- acquisition of DAI Ceramics, Inc., a specialized producer of ceramic cores for precision casting applications, such as the production of advanced components for aircraft engines and stationary gas turbines, implants and other delicate high-tech applications in foundries. In 2017, we acquired the UK electro-ceramics business of Morgan Advanced Materials plc, which included two manufacturing sites in the United Kingdom, further strengthening our piezo-ceramics product portfolio. In 2018, a consortium of funds led by BC Partners, and participated by PSP Investments and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan acquired the Target Group. In early 2021, we strengthened our leadership in the ceramic med-tech market with the acquisition of Dentalpoint AG, a Swiss corporation specialized in ceramic dental implants. Most recently, on August 16, 2021, Bidco, an entity beneficially owned by a consortium led by funds advised by BC Partners and CPP Investments, entered into the Acquisition Agreement with CTEC Acquisition S.à r.l. for the acquisition of the Target Group.

As a medical engineering partner, we offer a tailored materials portfolio for greater product efficiency, safety and durability, for precision and process efficiency from the initial concept to largescale production. Our Medical markets portfolio covers four product groups: Orthopedic hip replacement implants, Dental implants, Other orthopedic implants and Medical equipment. Our revenue from medical equipment markets is presented as part of our Medical markets revenue in this offering memorandum as we believe it is more consistent with our market-based approach to our business. Historically, we have reported revenue from medical equipment markets as part of Industrials revenue in our Financial Statements. _Orthopedic Hip Implants Overview_ Our main orthopedics implant focus is on ceramic components for hip joint prostheses, such as ball heads and cup inserts, to be used in hip replacement procedures. Ceramic materials are replacing traditional materials such as metal contained in hip joint prosthetic components. In addition to their wear resistance and excellent friction behavior, high performance ceramics are biologically inert, therefore representing one of the few materials that are durable and stable enough to withstand the corrosive effects of bodily fluids. Research has also shown that ceramic hip joint components are less susceptible to fracture than certain other alternative materials. Practitioners recognize our high performance ceramic components for medical implants as the superior solution with proven benefits and with a superior clinical record as compared to other materials such as metal alloys of cobalt and chrome. As a result, ceramics penetration in global medical implant markets is steadily rising, leading to market-beating growth for our ceramic components. For example, in relation to hip implants, the ceramic volume share of ball heads is expected to increase from approximately 47% in 2019 to approximately 58% in 2026, with a longer-term penetration potential of 100% for ceramic ball heads according to a leading international consultancy firm. As a result, we believe that high performance ceramics will increasingly become more common for medical applications, such as for the repair and replacement of hips, knees and other human body parts. -111 ----- We leverage over 25 years of best-in-class brand heritage and product expertise. In particular, BIOLOX[®] is our key brand and product line for our orthopedics business. Our BIOLOX[®] product line has been in the market since 1974 and, as of today, well over 20 million BIOLOX[®] components have been delivered to medical OEMs worldwide. We believe that our BIOLOX[®] components are the “gold-standard” for hip implants with a unique market position, and hip implant systems containing our BIOLOX[®] components have become the product of choice for surgeons around the globe. Our end customers are well-established blue-chip entities such as DePuy, Smith & Nephew, Stryker and Zimmer Biomet. We also supply challengers including Medacta, Corin, Aesculap, Wego and AK Medical, with the aim of strengthening our customer base and maintaining our market leading position despite potential market share shifts between established blue-chip and challengers. We believe our customers are highly loyal as we have a strong reputation with surgeons and care providers. Many of our medical solutions have been developed in collaboration with our customers in order to be customized for their hip implant systems. We believe that our BIOLOX[®] brand has come to symbolize high quality and the industry standard for hip replacement procedures. Demand for our BIOLOX[®] products is also supported by our reputation and clinical history. The ceramic components for hip joint prostheses are produced at our facilities in Marktredwitz and Plochingen in Germany, and are sold to OEM orthopedic implant manufacturers globally. After successfully expanding our medical production facilities in Marktredwitz in 2013 and 2014 and again in 2019 and 2020, our annual production capacity exceeded 2.1 million units (based on current product mix) on a year-to-date basis as of September 30, 2021 and we expect it to exceed 2.3 million units as of December 31, 2021 (based on current product mix). We believe that our production capacity allows us to further ensure security of supply for our customers and increase our ability to efficiently react to fluctuations in demands by leveraging our increased number of production lines. _Hip Replacement Therapy_ The most common cause of chronic hip pain and disability is arthritis, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and traumatic arthritis. Hip replacement therapy is used to treat hip pain when other more conservative alternatives such as medication or physical therapy are no longer a feasible option. It involves surgically replacing damaged parts of the hip with implants or prostheses. As a result of age or other factors, the protective cartilage tissue between the bones that meet at the hip joint, the acetabulum and femur, can be worn out, damaging the joint and causing pain and reduced mobility. Depending on the type and severity of damage to the joint, treatments of choice are partial or total joint replacement procedures, or a revision procedure after an initial implant. If only a portion of the femoral side of the joint is damaged, the affected parts can be replaced, with a partial joint replacement restoring function and reducing discomfort for patients. However, when the entire joint is damaged, a total joint replacement is necessary. A revision procedure may be required or desirable to replace, repair or enhance the initial prosthesis. While our current product portfolio mainly consists of components for total hip replacement systems, we also manufacture components for partial and revision procedures. In 2019, approximately 3.6 million hip replacement procedures (including partial procedures, revisions and resurfacing) were performed worldwide, according to a leading international consultancy firm. The diagram below illustrates the step-by-step procedure carried out for a total hip replacement. Hip replacement therapy is one of the most successful surgical procedures in modern medicine, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. First performed in 1960, improvements in both surgical techniques and materials have greatly increased the effectiveness of total hip replacement. A successful hip replacement procedure will relieve pain, increase motion and allow the patient to live a fuller, more active life. -112 ----- _Materials for Hip Implant Components_ To replicate the action of a human hip joint, an artificial hip replacement commonly has four parts: femoral stem, femoral ball head, acetabular insert and acetabular shell. The “acetabular cup” replaces the natural hip socket and consists of a shell and an insert. The femoral ball head allows the hip joint to rotate. The femoral stem is inserted into the femur and anchors the implant in place. The diagram below illustrates the hip joint replacement system. The acetabular cup insert is made of ceramic, metal or polyethylene (plastic), while the femoral ball head is made of ceramic or metal. The insert and the ball head together form the “bearing”, which is a performance-critical part of the hip implant system. The bearing affects the durability, mobility, flexibility and range-of-motion of the artificial joint. All of our hip joint products are advanced ceramic bearing components. The following table shows the options for combinations of materials used in artificial hip joint bearings: An important aspect of the bearings in total hip replacement systems is the amount of wear. Wear particles created by the articulating femoral ball head and acetabular cup insert are deposited in the surrounding tissues and have the potential to trigger inflammation and loosening of the implant, as well as other negative side effects. For example, metal-on-metal hip implants can cause cobalt and chromium wear particles to enter the patient’s bloodstream and result in metal toxicity. We believe that due to the superior wear rate and biocompatibility of ceramic components, they will increase penetration in the hip joint market. Ceramic ball heads can also be used in combination with polyethylene or the more recently-developed highly cross-linked polyethylene cup insert with better results than metal ball heads. Additionally, clinical studies have demonstrated that ceramic-on-ceramic bearings have the lowest wear rates and generate wear particles with the lowest level of reactivity due to size, shape and chemical composition. _Products_ For ceramic ball heads and cup inserts used for hip joint implant systems, we believe our BIOLOX[®] brand has come to symbolize high quality and innovative products. More than 20 million BIOLOX[®] products have been sold worldwide. We believe that we are a market leader in ceramic components for hip joints globally. According to a leading international consultancy firm, penetration of ceramics hip ball heads in hip implants was 47% for hip ball heads and 12% for hip inserts in 2019, with expected penetration of 58% and 13%, respectively, for 2026, and 100% and 40%, respectively, on the longer term. The rationale for the potential 100% longer-term penetration for ceramic hip ball heads is based on better patient outcomes from ceramic due to reduced wear and higher biocompatibility (given the elimination of risks from potentially toxic metal ions). The 40% longer-term penetration for ceramic hip inserts is based on the longer durability of ceramic-on-ceramic implants, with such lower penetration percentage being due to stronger availability of ceramic-on-polyethylene alternative products. -113 ----- We currently offer two different ceramic materials under our BIOLOX[®] brand which are compatible with each other. - BIOLOX[®]forte, introduced in 1995, represents of previous generation of ball head and insert products. BIOLOX[®]forte solutions offer properties that are designed to exceed the requirements outlined in ISO 6474-1, the relevant standard establishing the mechanical and other properties for the product, that is taken into account by the FDA in its regulatory review processes. BIOLOX[®]forte is made of high purity alumina with a small share of magnesium oxide to control grain growth and achieve maximum density. BIOLOX[®]forte is based on over 40 years of clinical experience, particularly our experience with hip joint replacement parts marketed and sold before the introduction of our BIOLOX[®]forte implants. - BIOLOX[®]delta, introduced in 2003, consists of a newer generation of material, compared to BIOLOX[®]forte. It consists of a mixed oxide ceramic with increased fracture strength, improved wear properties and biocompatibility. The main difference between BIOLOX[®]forte and BIOLOX[®]delta is BIOLOX[®]delta’s greater strength, which makes it possible to produce thinner cup inserts and both revision ball heads and femoral ball heads. BIOLOX[®]delta was developed to open up a broader range of clinical uses for a wider range of customer-specific designs for ball heads and cup insert including customers who are not currently using BIOLOX[®]forte. In over 15 years of clinical experience, we have sold a total of over 14 million BIOLOX[®]delta branded ball heads and inserts since 2003. Within the above brands, we sell the following key products to our OEM implant manufacturer customers for use in their hip joint replacement systems. - BIOLOX[®] _Ball Heads:_ Given the size range of our BIOLOX[®] ball heads and compatibility with other BIOLOX[®] family products as well as conventional polyethylene and highly cross-linked polyethylene cup inserts, we are able to offer our customers a number of possibilities for their hip replacement systems. We produce ball heads with diameters of 22 mm, 28 mm, 30 mm, 32 mm, 34 mm, 36 mm, 38 mm, 40 mm and 44 mm (while diameters of 22 mm, 30 mm and 38 mm are available in BIOLOX[®]delta only) to accommodate the size of the patient’s acetabular cup, and with neck lengths in up to four sizes: small, medium, large and x-large (while the x-large size is available in BIOLOX[®]delta only) to accommodate a patient’s body structure, such as leg length and tension of ligaments, and lifestyle needs. BIOLOX[®] ball heads are available in both BIOLOX[®]forte and BIOLOX[®]delta materials. - BIOLOX[®] _Cup Inserts:_ We manufacture two types of ceramic cup insert—monoblock cup inserts which are assembled during the production process by our customers and modular cup inserts which are larger and assembled by surgeons during the hip replacement procedure. With our ceramic modular cup insert, long term secure fixation of the insert in the acetabular shell is achieved by means of a particular fixation concept which fixes the BIOLOX[®] cup insert directly into the metal acetabular shell. With our monoblock cup inserts, state-of-the-art materials make it possible to optimize the diameter ratio between the ceramic head and the acetabulum. This enables treating even patients with a small acetabulum with relatively large ceramic ball heads, thereby leading to an increased range of motion and improved stability. Previously, this was only possible with metal-on-metal bearings. A special process is used to press the ceramic monoblock cup insert into the metal acetabular shell. BIOLOX[®] cup inserts are available in both BIOLOX[®]forte and BIOLOX[®]delta materials. - BIOLOX[®] _DUO:_ BIOLOX[®] DUO, which is made from BIOLOX[®]forte, is an innovative ceramic-on-ceramic alternative in partial hip replacement. There are two parts to the BIOLOX[®] _DUO: the ceramic ball head is attached to the femoral stem and articulates against the ceramic cavity of a ball-shaped bipolar shell which in turn articulates against the patient’s natural acetabular cartilage. The bipolar system transfers joint movement mainly into the ceramic-on-ceramic bearing part, reducing the relative motion on the acetabular side to further protect the patient’s natural cartilage. Additionally, the ceramic-on-ceramic bearing results in reduced wear debris compared to polyethylene and metal. Consequently, metal sensitivity and the risk of aseptic loosening due to polyethylene particles are also reduced. The implant is particularly suitable for younger, more active patients and for patients with metal sensitivity. -114 ----- - BIOLOX[®] _OPTION:_ The BIOLOX[®] _OPTION product is used for revision procedures in total hip replacement. It is intended for use either for cup revision or ball head exchange in cases where ceramic heads must be replaced on in situ femoral stems. Furthermore, the neck system offers an increased range of neck lengths for primary hip replacements. We also dedicate our VERILOX[®] product line to the offering of ceramic components for orthopedic implants to be used in animal medicine for the treatment of hip dysplasia and severe osteoarthritis. Total hip replacement can be performed on dogs ranging from five to 170 pounds (about 2 kg to 70 kg in size), and on cats. VERILOX[®] ceramics are designed to be hypoallergenic and to assist rapid bone ingrowth with less bacteria adhesion compared to other materials. The following table provides a breakdown of the growth in number of ball-heads and inserts units sold for the last five years.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

There are currently four main combinations of ball head and cup insert materials for hip implants in the market: (i) ceramic ball head and ceramic cup insert (“ceramic-on-ceramic”), (ii) ceramic ball head and polyethylene cup insert (“ceramic-on-polyethylene”), (iii) metal ball head and polyethylene cup insert (“metal-on-polyethylene”) and (iv) metal ball head and metal cup insert (“metal-on-metal”). We focus solely on ceramic components. Metal ball heads are increasingly subject to safety concerns, including corrosion and release of allergens causing hypersensitivity, but are still being used due to their lower price. Metal-on-metal combinations have been declining over the years as cobalt chrome, which are used in metal hip implants, was identified as a potentially carcinogenic substance by the U.S. National Institute of Health in November 2016. Ceramic is not known to have any of these drawbacks, which has led to increasing penetration rates as metal has been increasingly substituted with ceramic. In addition, we are experiencing increasing levels of trust among surgeons due to continued growth in our clinical track record as well as improved training of surgeons about the properties of ceramic implants. Ceramic also offers postoperative process benefits, because the capsule and the tissue around the ceramic implant undergo a better healing process, with reduced risk of infections. We service the hip replacement market with ball heads, cup inserts and option heads (used for revisions). According to a leading international consultancy firm, the total size of the global hip implant market addressed by us amounted to approximately €600 million in 2019 (i.e., including market shares covered by metal and polyethylene). The -115 ----- total addressable market is expected to grow with the number of hip replacement procedures, a key driver of demand for ceramic ball heads and inserts, according to the same source. Further, ceramic as a material is increasingly used in revisions and hip replacement procedures. The market for ceramic ball heads is significantly larger than for inserts and option heads as ball heads are used across all of hip replacement procedures. As the hip replacement market grows, ceramic components are expected to increase their share of the market by replacing traditional materials for hip joint prosthetic components such as metal which can trigger negative patient reactions, for example due to allergic reactions resulting from metal sensitivity, and have experienced documented safety concerns. Globally, penetration of ceramic ball heads (ceramic-on-ceramic and ceramic-on-polyethylene) as a percentage of applied hip implants as a result of performed hip implant procedures was estimated at 47% in 2019, according to a leading international consultancy firm. A further increase in ceramic penetration in ball heads is expected, reaching a 100% penetration on the longer term. _Competition in Medical Applications_ We sold approximately 1.6 million units of BIOLOX[®] products in 2020 (which includes the impact of procedure postponements during COVID-19-related lockdowns). Our competitors are mainly active in niche markets or specific geographies as shown in the table below. Additionally, some of our competitors, such as Kyocera, manufacture hip replacement systems (rather than only the components) and therefore compete directly against our customers.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

These regulations govern, among other things, product development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, sales and distribution and performance/effectiveness. Failure to comply with the FDCA and applicable FDA regulations could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to clear or approve a product candidate, product recall, product seizure, interruption of production, operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of product approval, injunctions or criminal prosecution. Certain of our dental-implant products, and most of our customers’ products and our ceramic-on-polyethylene products (ceramic ball heads against “soft” cup insert made from polyethylene or variants of polyethylene, such as highly cross-linked polyethylene), require the submission of a premarket notification, commonly referred to as a 510(k), to the FDA prior to marketing the product. This process requires us or our customers to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device before the FDA will clear the new device for commercial distribution in the United States. We hold four 510(k)s for our ZERAMEX[®] dental implant systems, the most recent being cleared in November 2018. Certain other devices our customers develop and market and our ceramic-on-ceramic products (hard-hard bearings, i.e. ceramic ball heads against ceramic cup insert) fall into a class of products for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval (PMA) requirements. The PMA process requires the submission of clinical and laboratory data that establishes that medical device products are safe and effective for their intended uses. The FDA will approve a medical device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information provided in the PMA relating to design, materials, bench and animal testing and human clinical data, including any data provided with respect to our ceramic components, constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities (which may extend to our facilities, because we supply key components to the overall hip replacement joints) for compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR) which governs testing, control, documentation and other aspects of quality assurance. The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). Once FDA approval is granted, a medical device can be marketed to the end-customers. One or more clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. Clinical studies of unapproved or uncleared medical devices or devices being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. We maintain separate device master files with the FDA to support our customers through the regulatory process and protect our technology and know-how. The master files contain data and information on our products (relating to ceramic femoral heads and inserts) so that we can provide our customers with a reference to the file number that they can use during the approval or notification process with the FDA. This also means that we do not need to share our valuable know-how or studies with our customer. Changes in a medical device approved or cleared by the FDA, including changes or substitution of components, such as our ceramic components, may trigger a new FDA 510(k) clearance or FDA approval process, including the PMA process and potentially additional clinical trials. After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include the QSR regulation, which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test, manufacture, exercise quality control over and document manufacturing of their products, labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling, and the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to the FDA certain adverse experiences associated with use of the product. _European Economic Area_ The regulation of our customers’ and our products in Europe falls primarily within the EEA, which currently consists of the twenty-seven Member States of the European Union plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and has approximately 450 million inhabitants. -120 ----- In the EEA, our customers’ and our devices are required to comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of April 5, 2017 on medical devices, which came into force on May 26, 2021 (the “MDR”). We do not act as a legal manufacturer within the EEA according to the MDR (with the exception of Dentalpoint AG with regard to dental implants), for our BIOLOX[®] products and currently, these certifications under the MDR are solely handled by our customers. However, we do act as a legal manufacturer within the EEA according to the MDR for our ZERAMEX[®] products and therefore these products, must be registered and approved by a Notified Body (as defined below) before commencement of marketing and sale activities. Effective May 26, 2021, the new Medical Devices Regulation has introduced a number of significant changes to the legal framework for medical devices in the EEA. These changes include the reclassification of certain medical devices, more stringent requirements to conduct clinical performance studies and to collect and retain post-market clinical data, the introduction of a unique device identification for all medical devices and a new scrutiny mechanism for certain high-risk medical devices undergoing conformity assessments by independent and neutral institutions designated by a Member State of the EEA (“Notified Bodies”), which may be required to consult with an expert panel before allowing the device to be placed in the market. We have established a dedicated team to evaluate the impact of these new requirements under MDR, conduct a gap analysis and adapted our internal processes and documents to both comply with and support our customers to comply with these new regulations. We have also implemented selected amendments to certain quality agreements. For our DENSILOX[®] and ZERAMEX[®] products, this includes re-certification of our quality management systems under MDR. Compliance with the requirements under MDR entitles us and our customers to affix CE marks to the medical devices, verifying that the products meet MDR and national law requirements for medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the EEA. Medical devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021, may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, and any new products will need to be certified under MDR going forward. The European standards bodies, mainly the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), have adopted numerous harmonized standards covering a wide range of devices or specific devices or device categories. Compliance with the relevant harmonized standards applicable to a given medical device provides a presumption of conformity with the general safety and performance requirements. The European Commission has adopted various guidelines, consensus statements and interpretative documents aimed at ensuring the uniform application of the provisions of the MDR. In order to demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE conformity mark, products must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices, non-reusable surgical instruments), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements of the MDR, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an independent and neutral institution designated by a Notified Body. Typically, the Notified Body, during the course of reviewing a product application (Technical Documentation), will confirm that Quality System certifications are being upheld through ongoing assessments which are conducted separately and must be evidenced to complete the conformity assessment. For our customers, we can draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity which allows our customers to affix the CE mark to their products. Among possible conformity procedures, the most common is the assurance of a “Full quality management System” pursuant to Annex XI of the MDR (based on the requirements of ISO13485), which will be combined with a review of the Technical Documentation. Further, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EEA Member States’ laws implementing the Medical Devices, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation and national laws governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices (for example, the German Drug Advertisement Law). These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our customers’ and our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. _United Kingdom_ Following Brexit, the legal framework for the regulation of medical devices in the United Kingdom is provided by the Medical Devices Regulations 2002, which gives effect to the EU Medical Devices Regulation in the United Kingdom. In accordance with applicable UK legislation, our existing certificates of conformity bearing CE marking and issued by EU bodies will continue to be recognized in United Kingdom until June 30, 2023. However, starting from July 1, 2023, medical devices which are placed on the market in in the United Kingdom will be required to bear a UKCA mark and must, in the case of Class IIb medical devices, successfully complete a conformity assessment by a UK “approved body”. In addition, any medical device to be placed on the market in United Kingdom must be registered with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), which is now a standalone regulatory body. The UK government has introduced a new Medicines and Medical Device Act which transfers the regulatory decisionmaking formerly carried out by the European Commission to the MHRA. The MHRA may choose to align with MDR going forward or retain regulatory flexibility through domestic legislation. -121 ----- Under the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU legal framework governing medical devices, including the Medical Devices Regulation, also applies in Northern Ireland.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, our Industrials markets revenue represented 51.9% of our revenue. The business generated from the Industrials markets demonstrated our robust resilience through the recent economic downturns, largely due to our broad end-market focus and the diversification of our customer base. We are a HPC player with a portfolio comprised of many different solutions used across various end-markets, which we believe reduces our exposure to a single industry or product. Our dedicated teams of scientists and engineers collaborate closely with customers to develop tailor-made solutions and production processes to fulfil distinct functionality and performance requirements, and to research a pipeline of next-generation products. We streamlined our organizational framework by changing our commercial set-up to a customer-focused end-market driven sales organization, with three main areas based on customer industry verticals, while also deploying commercial excellence programs for our entire organization. As a result of our revamped customer-centric go-to-market strategy in our Industrials markets and our materials and manufacturing process expertise, we are able to provide our customers with product solutions for which the superior properties of ceramic material can be considered. Due to the superior characteristics of advanced ceramics, such as better wear and heat resistance than alternative materials, our HPC solutions are often performance-critical components. In addition, we harmonized and standardized site management activities, implementing a robust sales, inventory and operations (“SIOP”), which enabled us to reduce capacity constraints and lead times, improving our working capital management as well as delivery to promise. We also deployed improvement programs targeting employees, based on Lean Principles, with good engagement levels. _Industrials End-Markets_ Industrials markets includes multiple end-markets, including mobility, electronics, industrial applications and International Affiliates. Each of our Industrials end-markets is also influenced by separate and distinct factors and has a different economic cycle. Across our end-markets, we maintain long relationships with our blue-chip customer base, and a streamlined set-up. This enables us to supply bespoke product solutions, enhanced by our distinct competencies, with the aim to deliver significant competitive advantages to our customers. The table below sets out the split of revenue generated by our solutions for Industrials markets based on targeted end-market for the year ended December 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.99,Kyocera** **CoorsTek** **Nevz-Ceramics** **Mathys** **Metoxit** **LCERAM** **Ceraver,17.99.3,,"- Kyocera - US - Russian - Swiss med- - Swiss - French - French manufactures ceramics manufacturer device OEM manufacturer manufacturer manufacturer medical manufacturer, of ceramic focused on of dental of metal and of hip and products, offers for industrial artificial joint ceramics, ceramic knee implant including ceramic hip and medical replacement chemistry components component artificial implant use products components for joint joints and components and reconstruction dental since in orthopedic implants and implants, 2011 in components spine primarily for South the Japanese America,2012 market in Europe and 2016 in the US - 510(k) clearance obtained for artificial hip joints in 2017, started selling in the U.S. the following year Source: a leading international consultancy firm Our ceramic ball heads and cup inserts have geometric specifications that accommodate our customers’ hip implant systems, and are manufactured with highly specialized equipment. If our customers were to switch to a new supplier or produce ceramic components in-house then a new procedure or approval by the applicable regulatory authority is required. Time-consuming and expensive regulatory procedures for new products and costly clinical trials provide our customers with little incentive to switch to alternative suppliers. Moreover, as of September 30, 2021, we maintain a quality and regulatory team of over 50 people, specifically trained, among other things, to assist our customers in the complex regulatory procedures relating to our products. Surgeons tend to be reluctant to adopt new hip implant prostheses where they lack experience or if there is limited clinical history. Our BIOLOX[®] product line has been in the market since 1974 and well over 20 million BIOLOX[®] products have been implanted in patients worldwide. As a result, we believe that BIOLOX[®] is considered the industry standard by surgeons for ceramic-based total hip replacement procedures. Further, we believe that our ability to produce ceramic components at an industrial scale, while still maintaining a strict quality control regime and a track record of continuous productivity improvement, provides us with a competitive advantage that we believe would require significant investment for any competitor to replicate. We also believe that OEMs prefer to contract with large suppliers that have the capacity and flexibility to react to volume changes and the ability to enter into long-term relationships. Given the foregoing, we enjoy a stable leading position in Medical markets based on our significant competitive advantage in the form of, amongst others things, regulatory approval requirements, well- established relationships with key hip implant manufacturers including the top OEMs, and the high reputational and financial risk associated with the impact of an implant product failure and recall. -116 ----- _Customers_ We have a longstanding relationship with all of the key hip replacement implant OEMs, including the top orthopedic implant OEMs who together have a strong presence in the global hip implant market. We believe that our strategic relationship with each of the top orthopedic implant OEMs is key to our strong position in the ceramic hip replacement components market. We co-design our ceramic components (both ball heads and cup inserts) which are highly customized to the hip implant prosthesis of our end-customers and are critical to the overall performance of their hip implant systems. As a result, we believe that our customers are not incentivized to replace our components and switch suppliers. Our core know-how lies in the BIOLOX[®] materials, the manufacturing process, application know-how and the ability to produce at scale. In addition, we consider our global scale difficult to replicate for competitors, in light of the significant investments required to this end. We also collaborate with our OEM customers to assist them in reaching end-users and key decision makers, which we believe has contributed to our high level of brand loyalty, characterized by a high contract renewal rate, with very low customer churn. Health care regulatory bodies in the applicable jurisdiction, insurance providers, health care systems and the reimbursement environment all influence the choice of hip implant systems. In general, surgeons are the final decision makers who choose the hip replacement materials based on patient needs and personal experience. In the United States, while surgeons are also important, patients are increasingly becoming more knowledgeable and aware of the benefits and risks of implant materials and in some cases exert influence on decision-making. To increase the safe and effective use of our products, we conduct surgeon training sessions and produce clinical articles, apps and educational literature on our medical products that we make widely available. We hold workshops with high class international faculty covering all aspects of bearings in total hip replacement procedures. We monitor all of these sales activities closely for compliance with applicable regulations on interactions with health care professionals. In addition, certain of our OEM customers market their implant systems with the BIOLOX[®] logo on their packaging or include it their surgical technique brochures. We believe that all of these activities significantly increase our brand awareness. Our key customers comprise the bulk of our Medical markets revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top four customers in Medical markets made up 44% of our Medical markets revenue, while the top ten customers accounted for 63%. _Dental Implants Overview_ Our dental sub-area focuses on a highly-specialized product portfolio that includes FDA-cleared and CE-marked products, centered around a full ceramic dental implant offering. Our aim is to provide OEMs with a “one-stop shop” solution, which includes the complete management of the development and production processes as well as key components such as thorough quality control and handling of the regulatory workstream. The broad range of services included in our offering therefore reflects the complete product life cycle workflow; from ideation, engineering, manufacturing, and regulatory to marketing and education. In addition to acting as provider of white-label solutions to certain customers, we also sell our products directly and indirectly through our DENSILOX[®] and ZERAMEX[®] brands. While each service and product can be tailored to the customer’s needs in order to create maximum value, we also maintain a growing portfolio of digital solutions, in order to facilitate a completely digital workflow for customers. _Dental Implant Procedure_ The dental implant procedure consists of a time-intensive 5-step process, the characteristics of which are ultimately dependent on the chosen treatment and the patient’s prior oral health condition. The process is illustrated in the diagram below. -117 ----- _Dental Implant Design_ The dental implant market is characterized by two key dental implant designs: a one-piece implant and a two-piece implant, the difference depending on whether the surgical implant and the prosthetic abutment are integrated into one single piece or rather into two separate components. - One-piece implant designs predominantly use a restoration retention mechanism consisting of cement-retained solutions, based on which crowns are cemented to the abutment allowing for maximum aesthetics, due to the lack of a screw access hole and the compensation of improperly inclined implants. - Two-piece implant designs offer a different restoration retention mechanism, namely screw-retained solutions. In the context of this implant, screws are placed into the crown post through the abutment, which in turn enables easy retrievability of restoration allowing for repair or examination of soft tissue and direct visualization of the implant. _Products_ We provide a full ceramic dental implant range across implant fixtures, internal connection and prosthetics and operate a three-pronged go-to-market strategy via (i) direct sales, (ii) distributors and (iii) OEMs partnerships (white label and custom-designed). According to leading international consultancy firm, the dental product line provides access to a market of €2.6 billion (US and EU-5) in 2019, which is expected to grow overall by 4.8% per annum between 2022 and 2026 due to rising demand for tooth replacement, while ceramic penetration is also expected to significantly increase resulting in average growth of the ceramic dental implant EU-5 and US markets by approximately 10% per year between 2022 and 2026. This growth is also driven by rising awareness for clinical benefits of ceramic compared to titanium implants (which includes, for example, high biocompatibility and fast healing time due to less gum recession). Our products in the dental implant offering employ highly innovative ceramic implant materials, which are 100% metal-free, with high corrosion resistance, hardness and toughness. The materials are also designed to have a high fracture strength and low thermal conductivity. We apply our robust ceramic manufacturing know-how to implement standardized production processes, which can be replicated both for small- and large-scale production and can accommodate a flexible range of manufacturing technologies (including, among others, ceramic injection molding). A key component is our proprietary VICARBO[®] technology connecting the implant fixture with the abutment and crown, which is made of carbon-fiber-reinforced high-performance PEEK polymer, to allow for medically optimal elasticity in a completely metal-free implant system. In addition, certain studies mainly focusing on use of zirconia materials (“TZP”) have shown that ceramic surfaces have low potential of bacterial colonization. The reduction of peri-implant plaque formation may therefore simplify hygiene for the patient and prevent gum inflammations. Our offering includes products that are regulated as Class IIb implants in the EU, and accordingly, such products are provided with clean-room packaging (which can be strengthened by optional sterile packaging). In addition, the cleanliness of our DENSILOX[®] products is audited by the Clean Implant Foundation (“CIF”) GmbH. Our dental product offering is comprised of the following solutions: - Under the DENSILOX[®] brand, we offer high quality one- and two-piece implants and abutments exclusively as white-label solutions to OEMs, leveraging over 30 years of experience in dental applications. All DENSILOX[®] ceramic implants are made of 100% metal-free and biocompatible oxide-based materials, and are categorized as Class IIb implants in the EU. In 2021, we were awarded a Certified Production Quality seal for the DENSILOX[®] offering by the CIF GmbH. - In January 2021, we acquired Dentalpoint AG, a Swiss leading producer of ceramic dental implants and abutments under the ZERAMEX[®] brand. ZERAMEX[®] implants are offered in all three of our dental go-to-market channels, and we are increasingly focusing on OEM partnerships. This portfolio consists of 100% metal-free and cement-free ceramic two-piece implants, with different prosthetic platforms and endosseous diameters, particularly suitable for anterior restorations enabling decisive implant osseointegration due to their micro-structured implant surface. The ZERAMEX[®] implants ensure high primary stability during placement due to the cylindrical-conical design of the implant thread. ZERAMEX[®] adds to our dental portfolio its patented VICARBO[®] Screw technology, which provides a 100% metal-free alternative with comparable flexibility to metal. This carbon fiber reinforced PEEK screw serves as the internal metal-free precision connection tool between implant and abutment, and ensures reliable protection against rotation (other ceramic implants use a metal screw or have a fixed (one-piece) connection of implant and abutment), a repeated correct positioning of the abutment and a tailored screw able to deform elastically in order to minimize bacteria accumulation. Through the ZERAMEX[®] Digital Solutions workflow, we can also offer individualized abutments and crowns suitable for highly aesthetic anterior restorations. Our ZERAMEX[®] implants are supported by long-standing clinical history, are CE marked and have received certain FDA 510(k) clearances. -118 ----- _Customers_ We sell our dental implant products through three main channels: direct sales (i.e., by directly targeting dentists), indirect sales (i.e., through distributors) and white-label sales (i.e., to large white-label dental players). White label customers seek one-stop shops for ceramic implant development and production, while dentists seek innovative products and digital services for end-to-end solutions. White-label customers can benefit from our CE-marked and FDA-cleared, ready to use white-label offer (including, for example, our ZERAMEX[®] XT implant) in order to expand their dental implant portfolio. _Medical Equipment_ As part of our portfolio for Medical markets, we also cater to medical equipment end-markets, by providing innovative ceramic offerings on the back of our material leadership and strong customer base. In particular, we focus on ultrasound equipment, flow sensors, disposable medical glove formers and other applications in the medical field such as hermetic products for medical, pharmaceutical or laboratory environments. In addition our ceramic sensor components, actuators, valves, connectors and vacuum connections can be used in a wide range of medical engineering applications, including analysis and sensor technologies. Further, piezo-ceramics can be used for ultrasound equipment and for high-powered ultrasonic transducers to send out wave signals (which are needed in treatment applications or as dental/surgical tools). In addition, piezo-ceramics can also be employed in ultrasonic sensors for drug delivery devices. Piezo-ceramic components are electromechanical transducers, and as such are able to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice-versa. Piezo-ceramic components help break up kidney and gall stones, give ultrasound diagnostics and treatment devices the necessary impulses and oscillate surgical knives and dental cleaning tools. Further application include their use as in lithotripter devices and surgical knives. Ceramic hand formers are also used in the manufacturing process for disposable medical gloves and particularly valued for their heat resistance. Our advanced ceramics ensure that dialysis machines, endoscopic equipment and heart pumps function reliably. In aerosol therapies, piezo-ceramic components are used in nebulizers. These appliances are complemented by our Ceramaseal[®] hermetic feedthroughs, which are used in X-rays and MRI scans. _Additional Orthopedic Applications_ In addition to our core business in the hip joint replacement market, we believe that the markets for spine replacement disc products, knee joint replacements and shoulder joint replacements could also contribute to the growth of the business generated by our products and solutions for Medical markets. We market and sell ceramic spine products, although our hip joint components sales still constitute the vast majority of our sales. We are in the process of the design and validation phases to develop our BIOLOX[®] knee implant. The total knee joint replacement market is larger than the total hip joint market, and, unlike hip systems where we supply ball heads and inserts in ceramics, the entire knee replacement implant system can be made of ceramics. However, ceramic components have not reached a significant market share of the total knee implant market to date. We also view the market for shoulder prostheses as another attractive area of application for ceramic components and have products for this market in our development pipeline, which are currently undergoing clinical trial. _Adjacent Medical Services_ We aim to maintain our position as a trusted strategic innovation partner within the end-markets addressed by our offering of medical products and solutions. Our product portfolio is therefore complemented by a wide range of value-adding services. Our services are designed to reflect the complete product lifecycle workflow of our customers, end-users and partners, from ideation over engineering, manufacturing, regulatory through marketing and education. Each service can be tailored to our customers’ needs, in order to achieve maximum value. In particular, services can be booked individually, or potentially being provided as a bundle, effectively outsourcing the entire product management workflow to us. Our service bundle can be divided into six categories: Ideation, Engineering, Manufacturing, Regulatory, Marketing and Education. As part of the “Ideation” services, we offer a range of solutions to support business partners in their innovation process. Our “Engineering” solutions cover wide range of engineering services, from 3D scanning, CAD modeling and design evaluation through FE Analyses, risk assessment, and rationales for regulatory purposes, standard testing, product-specific setups, and statistics. If required, through our “Manufacturing” services bundle we can support customers with our ISO-audited manufacturing equipment and production capacity, specifically deployed to assist with prototype and contract manufacturing (free of internal production capacity limitations or quality management investments). “Regulatory” services include customized projects and regulatory pathway planning, device classification and evaluation of predicate devices, technical file preparation and submission, as well as negotiations and communication with the responsible national authorities. In addition, as part of the “Marketing” offering, we provide a complete range of marketing solutions aimed at facilitating and accelerate successful product launches, while reinforcing brand visibility (for example, through the use of premium brands, clinical benefit assessments, dedicated scientific affairs, and market access expertise). Lastly, as part of our “Education” offering, we provide first-hand tailored training sessions directed at medical professionals, as well as at our customers’ marketing and sales teams. -119 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

(2) Industrial Applications revenue calculated as the sum of “Industrial Applications” and “Consolidation Industrial”. -122 ----- Our targeted Industrials end-markets are summarized below. _Mobility_ Ceramics offers significant contributions to mobility. For example, HPC components can be employed in vehicles as well as in production facilities for vehicle construction processes and as components and parts in a wide variety of applications (i.e., ceramic tapes for oxygen sensors and direct injection, or piezo-ceramic parts and assemblies for knock and parking sensors). We believe that our advanced ceramics play a key role in increasing safety, cost effectiveness and comfort in vehicle engineering. Our production of solutions for the mobility end-market is stable and reliable, ensuring quality. In addition, we maintain design and quality control measures which are based on mobility market quality control systems (such as ISO 16949), and strong collaboration ties with our customers’ technical teams. We maintain a resilient offering of solutions for internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicle and products. Our range of ceramic products includes applications across drivetrain, electronics and process technologies. We believe that the current declining trend of ICE demand will be overcompensated by growing demand in the e-mobility area, through the increasing market penetration of solutions dedicated to hybrid and electric vehicles. In the e-mobility sector, we provide high-performance components for electrical vehicles, which can be implemented both on fully electric or hybrid vehicles. New high power chip sets being developed in the e-mobility sector, as well as ongoing development of miniaturized power electronics, constantly require the research of newer and more efficient heat management solutions. Our ceramic solutions for e-mobility are specifically designed to contribute towards increasing battery power, comfort and safety of the e-vehicle. In particular, we developed solutions covering electric motors, charging units and passenger cells, as well as different substrates for high- and low-voltage circuit carriers (also through passive and active components installed on circuit protection appliances and circuit boards). Our products include piezo-ceramic components, which act as sensors for electronic controls and are therefore able to provide information on the vehicle’s quiet engine operation, position and changes in direction (see “—Ceramics Solutions in Industrials Markets”). Electronic components based on ceramic substrates react to this information and activate their control of motor management functions and vehicle safety systems, such as ABS and ASR (being also able to release the airbag when necessary). With regard to engines, heat-resistant ceramic parts such as valve components, backings in the crankshaft housing and components for water and fuel pumps, ensure increased efficiency, reduced wear and lower noise emissions. Our high-performance technical ceramics products are suitable for vehicles with combustion, hybrid and electric engines. In electric vehicles, HPC are used in thermal management systems, power electronics, bearing and other electrical components. In addition, hybrid vehicles include HPC components from both ICE and EV drivetrains, offering a high potential for bridging the transition to electric vehicles. Our ceramic-metal composites also include solutions for the light metal construction aspects of the mobility industry, while modern halogen or xenon light systems with ceramic components significantly improve visibility. The use of SPK[®] ceramic cutting materials and precision tools in mobility manufacturing also ensures the efficient production of vehicle components made of cast iron or hardened steels. Within the mobility end-market, our key customers include well-established mobility suppliers with whom we maintained strong relationships, such as BOSCH, Federal Mogul, Brembo, Faurecia, Hella and Schaeffler. We maintain a lead supplier role for most of our mobility end-market customers. _Electronics_ We are one of the leading manufacturers of HPC components in electronic applications, focusing on substrates and various other components are used throughout the field of power electronics, and particularly power modules. For example, ceramic heat sinks provide the right thermal environment for high power electronics, while ceramic substrates can be employed for metallized power electronic boards. In addition, components are used in the mobility industry, optoelectronics, measurement and control technology and in industry and entertainment electronics, while our dedicated teams operate in close integration with our customers’ R&D teams to develop next generation solutions. The Electronics end-market is currently driven by global trends and increasing technology requirements. For example, in the renewable energy area, newer generations of solar and wind plants require upgraded power electronics, able to increase efficient power transmission over long distances, and to support a more compact power conversion system. Moreover, increasing automation of manufacturing processes is driving demand for efficient power electronics solutions, while energy efficiency concerns and increased sector regulation are shaping the characteristics of electronic inverters and converters (for example, driving the development of variable speed control systems). We believe the above trends will result in increased demand for ceramics, to be primarily employed for high performance substrate materials meeting the needs for next-generation high power electronics, heaters and coolers, insulators and passive/active electrical components. Our leadership position largely relies on our Rubalit[®] and Alunit[®] substrates (which are industry standards for electronic circuit carriers), as well as on our high dimensional accuracy on an industrial scale. We believe we have the necessary manufacturing infrastructure to provide the next generation of substrate components, and to deliver products with -123 ----- unique characteristics which cannot be easily replicated by competitors (such as substrate surfaces), enabling us to deliver higher return yields with lower costs. Further, we deliver high-quality and reliable solutions, with no recorded critical defects. Our key customers include tier-2 and tier-3 suppliers placed at the beginning of the value-chain and global specialty electronic components providers, including among others Rogers, Heraeus, Littelfuse, IST, Vishay and TDK. _Industrials Applications_ The Industrials Applications end-market is very diverse, and spans across industries and niches such as metalworks, energy infrastructure, textile machinery, mechanical engineering, sanitary goods, white goods and chemicals, pumps and sealings, among others. These industries require the material properties of our ceramics solutions to manufacture bespoke and mission critical components. In this end-market we develop highly customized solutions, based on unique technological capabilities. We believe we act as an innovation partner for our customers, and represent a high quality and reliable supplier for the delivery of high precision and tight tolerance critical parts. In addition, HPC solutions can also be successfully used in markets including chemical processing, sanitary applications and consumer goods. For example, our HPC products are employed as catalysts in the production of chemicals, as seals in certain domestic appliances and in water faucets cartridges. Our advanced ceramics are capable of facilitating the secure control of industrial processes, enabling our customers to reduce production emissions and effectively manage scarce resources in a wide range of areas of chemicals and process engineering. For example, we provide silicon carbide (“SiC”) plates for semiconductor machinery, ongoing development efforts to expand our manufacturing scope. Specifically, advanced ceramics characteristics such as high wear resistance, temperature resistance and high corrosion resistance make our products an alternative to other materials in equipment, machine and plant engineering. We believe that the demand for HPC solutions for diversified industrial applications will increase, as machine become more complex in both design and manufacturing process, therefore requiring more resilient and efficient components to reduce both maintenance costs and unit failure rates. Our products contribute to the operating life and performance capabilities of machines and plants specifically in chemical, environmental or energy technology, in precision engineering or in metal forming. In addition, high-performance machining with SPK[®] cutting materials and tools offers a high degree also in the metalworking sector, significantly contributing to the shorter production times and decreased costs. Additional product applications include ceramic components for bearings, seals, valves, and texturing discs for the textile industry. Similarly, we provide solutions for different areas in the defense market including ballistic protection and reliable piezo-ceramics sensor components for sonar equipment. Ceramic armor components designed for ballistic vehicle protection deliver the required safety for military and emergency vehicles. Key customers in the Industrials Applications end-market include well-established blue-chip entities, such as, among others, Ideal Standard, Rheinmetall, Berliner Glas, BASF, Oerlikon and Hansgrohe. _International Affiliates_ Our non-German operating subsidiaries (“International Affiliates”) deliver highly customized product solutions in all Industrials end-markets. Our International Affiliates along with their main business activities, are set forth below. - _CeramTec North America._ CeramTec North America has special ceramic-to-metal and glass-to-ceramic seal technology capabilities. Key product groups for ceramic-metal connections are various hermetically sealed (Ceramaseal[®]) components including feedthroughs, multipin accessories and coaxial isolators, high-voltage bushings and ultra-high vacuum applications. In addition, CeramTec North America produces ceramics specifically formulated for the mobility, defense, energy & electronics, laser & high energy physics, scanning & analytical equipment, and semiconductors sectors. - _CeramTec Suzhou/China._ CeramTec Suzhou/China produces advanced ceramic components for the application of high-tech ceramic materials in the Chinese market, in particular, textile machine components, including thread guides, eyelets and extractor nozzles.

Key customers of our International Affiliates include well-established blue-chip entities, such as, among others, Raytheon, Oerlikon and Ferrotech Group. -124 ----- _Ceramic Solutions in Industrials Markets_ A selection of key products offered across our portfolio of solutions for Industrials markets is further described below. - _Piezo-ceramics._ Piezo-ceramics are capable of converting mechanical energy such as pressure or acceleration into electrical energy or, conversely, of transforming electrical signals into mechanical movement or oscillation. Our piezo-ceramic components and tapes are used in sensors, actuators and in power transducers for high-power ultrasonic applications, non-destructive material testing and sonar applications. Piezo-ceramics are also used in the medical industry for high frequency medical imaging. We have developed special highperformance materials for implementation in piezo applications, as piezo-ceramic components are sometimes exposed to high stress environments, while fulfilling their functions with maximum reliability. Further, our customers use piezo-ceramic components for a variety of purposes in automobiles, acting as sensors for electronic controls such as safety airbags and anti-lock braking systems (“ABS”) and providing information on a vehicle’s engine performance. - _Substrates for electronics._ We produce substrates as carriers for electronic circuits. Substrates are ceramic plates with electrical, thermal and mechanical properties that serve as heat conductors in electronic applications. Our substrates are mainly used for power electronic applications. We believe that we are among the top manufacturers of aluminum oxide substrates in terms of technological leadership. - _Ceramic tapes for lambda sensors._ We produce ceramic tapes for lambda sensors, which can be used to measure the oxygen content of exhaust gases in a car. Benefitting from uniform material properties, such tapes are thermal-shock resistant and can be produced on a large scale. - _Sealing discs and cartridges._ Our sealing discs and cartridges are used in the sanitary fittings and mobility supplier industries in areas where fluids are pumped, compressed or stirred, such as bushings, face seal rings, pump components, valve shims and sealing discs. Through different combinations of aluminum oxides and silicon carbides, we are able to fine-tune the sliding and sealing properties of seal rings and bearings to closely match the actual operating environments. For example, we supply sealing discs for single lever mixers in the sanitary fittings market comprised of Ceramdisc[®]-branded ceramic discs, for customers such as Ideal Standard. Mobility uses of sealing rings and discs have become an increasingly important part of our product mix, based on the multitude of uses from valves and sensor bodies to seal rings, seals and rollers for fuel and water pumps or roller bearings all the way to friction bearings and shafts. We also offer sanitary fitting cartridges which are designed to use in high-end faucet and mixing units. - _Friction discs._ Our friction discs are used for three-axle spindle units in the friction texturing of yarns and other small components such as needle guides in machine parts used in textile manufacturing. We recently introduced our CeramTec Standard S friction disc, which has an improved surface structure. Our friction discs exhibit high wear resistance as well as corrosion resistance, resulting in a long service life. - _Wear protective solutions._ Though our Alotec[®] product line, we provide solutions for wear, corrosion and temperature protection in industrial plants. Our wear solutions are mainly used in machines and systems in steel plants, in foundries, in the mining, processing and preparation of minerals. Customers of our wear solutions are mostly active within the paper, pulp, chemical and pharmaceutical industries, in power plants, in cement production, and in concrete production and transportation. - _Cutting tools._ We are a leading supplier of ceramic cutting tools as well as other tools and tooling systems for high speed processing in the mobility, metalworking and mechanical engineering industries. Beneficial properties of ceramic materials such as high melting points, excellent hardness and superior wear resistance make ceramics a favored high-speed cutting tool material. In addition, the longer life and faster cutting speeds possible with ceramics allow customers to save costs by increasing their throughput and reducing the downtime for replacing their cutting tools. Under the SPK[®] brand name, we offer a wide range of cutting ceramics and precision tools for machining applications. Additionally, our polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (“pCBN”) product range, made of the second hardest material on Earth and characterized by outstanding hardness especially under high temperatures has been a key growth driver for cutting tools product range.

We have a strong, centralized R&D infrastructure with over 150 scientists and engineers who work in modern laboratory facilities and collaborate with leading research institutions globally. Our total R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were €20.6 million (representing 3.7% of our total revenue for the period). Parts of the development costs are customer-related. While we cooperate with many leading research institutions and universities, we aim to focus on commercial applications rather than being the first in innovations with unclear commercial potential. Our R&D efforts are also directed towards the innovation of new products and development of new materials to respond to anticipated customer needs. For example, to address needs of both surgeons and patients, we research and regularly develop upgrades to our existing medical product portfolio and, more recently, have developed BIOLOX CONTOURA[®] in cooperation with the Harris Orthopedics Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, a novel licensed design ball head line, with an oval, more anatomical, geometry. BIOLOX CONTOURA[®] has received FDA clearance for use in certain prosthetic hip replacements without bone cement and was launched in the United States in 2019. In addition, over the same period we also developed and launched on the market the ceramic core for the Simplify[®]Disc spinal disc implant by Simplify Medical (now part of the NuVasive group). Simplify[®]Disc received FDA approval for use in certain 1-level implants in 2020, and approval for use in certain 2-level implants in 2021. While specific development topics for product groups are addressed in follow-up projects, the development of new technologies in materials preparation is facilitated and aided by laboratory equipment for the development of materials and formulations on a pilot scale. For example, we also launched two resurfacing projects now undergoing clinical trials. In recent years, we succeeded in developing various R&D innovations including: - a ceramic cooling solution for a power module to be placed in inverters in the drive trains of electric cars; - a ceramic cooling solution for a power module for use in drive inverters in e-mobility; - a cooling solution for the e-mobility sector, based on chip-on-heat sink technology ceramic power module for drive inverters ; - Solid PcBN and ceramic indexable inserts solutions for machining of hardened components; and - producing ceramic sample containers for a space experiment facility on the International Space Station. Our R&D innovations have received various awards and most recently in 2021, we have been awarded the “Certified Production Quality” certificate by CleanImplant Foundation CIF GmbH in relation to our DENSILOX[®] dental implant sub-area and the “Weber Ultrasonics Supplier Excellence Award” in the category “Best Improving supplier” by our customer Weber Ultrasonics).

See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to our Business—We are subject to the risk of litigation and other claims,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—We may have only limited protection for our intellectual property and know-how and if it were copied by competitors, or if they were to develop similar intellectual property independently, our results of operations could be negatively affected” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Due to the nature of our business and products, we may be liable for damages arising out of product liability claims.” These legal proceedings include a variety of product_ liability cases in Europe brought by individuals. Additionally, we have been subject to legal disputes relating to intellectual property. For example, since 2013 we have been involved in a series of legal proceedings against C5 in Germany, the United States and France in relation to our trademarks for the distinctive pink color of our ceramic hip implant component BIOLOX[®] delta, in respect of which we incurred significant expenses and which remain ongoing. In France, we plan to challenge a recent judgement granted in favor of C5. In addition, we are and have been subject to certain employment-related disputes. There are no pending product liability cases in the United States as of the date of this offering memorandum. In Europe, there are 13 pending product liability cases involving fractured ceramic ball heads and cup inserts. When we determine that a significant risk of a future claim against us exists, we record provisions in an amount equal to our estimated liability. As of December 31, 2020, we set aside total provisions for legal disputes in an amount of €0.5 million and total provisions for tax-related disputes in an amount of €3.2 million. Further, as of December 31, 2020, we have set aside provisions in an amount of €3.4 million to cover for claims related to breach of warranties and product liability. We are not currently involved in any legal proceedings which, either individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse impact effect on our business or financial position and have allocated provisions which we believe to be sufficient to cover our perceived risk in connection with pending product liability claims. However, the outcome of legal proceedings can be extremely difficult to predict, and we offer no assurances in this regard. -132 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date. If the Issuer delivers global notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of Relevant Clearing System, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer. Any Notes represented by global notes held by a nominee of the Relevant Clearing System will be subject to the then applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, as applicable. Euroclear’s and Clearstream’s current practice is to make payments in respect of global notes to participants of record that hold an interest in the relevant global notes on the business day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Such Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account in connection with the Notes (less any property or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement such as ordinary course charges and fees paid to the bank holding the Escrow Account) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.” The Escrow Agent will be entitled pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to deduct amounts from the Escrowed Property in respect of negative interest having accrued on the Escrowed Property. The Issuer will be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to release any Escrowed Property (in which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Issuer) (the “Escrow Release”) (the date of the Escrow Release being referred to as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon delivery to the Escrow Agent, on or prior to August 31, 2022 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), of an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate”), upon which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely absolutely without further investigation, certifying that the following conditions (collectively, the “Escrow Conditions”) will be met substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Release on the Escrow Release Date: - the Escrowed Property will be applied in substantially the same manner as described in this offering memorandum; - the Acquisition will be consummated no more than five Business Days following the release of the Escrowed Property substantially on the terms set forth under “Summary—The Transactions” except for any changes or other modifications that will not, when taken as a whole, have a material adverse effect on the Holders of the Notes; and - as of the Acquisition Closing Date, there is no Default or Event of Default in respect of the Issuer under clauses (a), (b) or (e) of the first paragraph under the section titled “—Events of Default”. Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Escrow Accounts in accordance with the Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds” and the Escrow Accounts will be reduced to zero. In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date occurs and the Escrow Agent shall not have received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date or (ii) the Issuer informs the Escrow Agent and the Trustee in writing -170 ----- that, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Issuer will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the issue price of the Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below), subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer no later than one Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent (copied to the Paying Agent), and will provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the tenth Business Day after such notice is given by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder of Notes, the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes, shall be entitled to use the Escrowed Property to make such payments and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property to the Issuer. The Escrow Accounts will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the Notes that is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption of the Notes exceeds the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, the Parent will have committed to make an equity contribution to the Issuer to fund the difference between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the Escrowed Property. In order to secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) of the Notes, if applicable, the Issuer will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, subject to certain liens of the Escrow Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account and the Issuer’s rights under the Escrow Agreement, pursuant to one or more escrow account charges dated on or about the Issue Date between the Issuer, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent (the “Escrow Charge”); provided that such liens and security interest shall automatically be released and terminate upon receipt by the Trustee of either an Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined below). The Escrow Charge will provide that the funds will be segregated and held for the purposes specified herein.

The Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property as directed by the Issuer in such short-term liquid investments (including bank deposit products) as permitted under the Escrow Agreement, and liquidate such investments, as the Issuers will from time to time direct in writing. Receipt by the Trustee of either an Officer’s Certificate for the release or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Charge. The Issuer from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or more replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, which, in each case, must be the Trustee, Escrow Agent, an Initial Purchaser or one or more of their respective banking affiliates, and may transfer any portion of the Escrowed Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”) without such Transfer being deemed a Release; provided that the Issuer provides a substantially equivalent security interest to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or accounts if such security interest was initially granted in connection with the original Escrow Account; provided, _further, that use of the funds from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as applied to the original Escrow_ Account. In such an event, any replacement or alternative accounts into which Escrowed Property is transferred shall be deemed to be an Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee from the Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the transfer of the Escrowed Property from the original Escrow Account to a new Escrow Account. If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption to the extent so required. Any of the provisions in this section, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Escrow Conditions and the conditions applicable to a Special Mandatory Redemption (other than the Special Mandatory Redemption Price) may be waived or modified by Holders representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.10,Note Guarantees,21.10.1,General,"On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and severally and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by CTEC III GmbH, a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) organized under the laws of Germany, registered in the commercial register of the local court (Amtsgericht) of Munich under HRB 267814, with business address at Schwanthalerstraßse 73, 80336 Munich, Germany (“Bidco”). Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material -171 ----- limitations pursuant to applicable laws, within 120 days from the Business Day immediately after the Acquisition Closing Date, and substantially concurrently with the Guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement, the Notes are expected to be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by certain members of the Target Group that will guarantee the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (the “Post-Closing Guarantors”). Such members of the Target Group granting such Note Guarantees are currently expected to be CeramTec GmbH and CeramTec North America LLC. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each Post-Closing Guarantor. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by _Restricted Subsidiaries” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles and certain material_ limitations pursuant to applicable laws, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Post-Closing Guarantors accounted for 79.8% of total assets of the Target Group (before giving effect to purchase price allocation adjustments and minor top level adjustments, but after giving effect to intercompany eliminations other than intercompany profit eliminations), 78.3% of the revenue (before giving effect to consolidation adjustments) and 88.7% of the EBITDA (before giving effect to consolidation adjustments) of the Target Group. By its terms, the obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws and the Note Guarantees of, or the relevant Note Documents to be entered into by, certain Guarantors organized in certain jurisdictions, including, without limitation, Germany and the United States, will contain language limiting the amount of indebtedness guaranteed or qualifying the Note Guarantee in order to address applicable local law considerations (including preservation of share capital and statutory reserves, capitalization, prohibited financial assistance, corporate benefit principles and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders and directors or managers). In addition, the Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles as described below under “—Security—General.” The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, liquidity impairment rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. However, such limitations may not be effective under local law. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the _Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The insolvency laws of Germany and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests (as defined herein), including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability_ of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on _the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_ The Issuer is a holding company and its only material assets are its interests in the capital stock of its Subsidiaries. As such, the Issuer will be dependent upon the Restricted Subsidiaries to make payments to it to service interest, principal and other payments on the Notes. A significant portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security granted over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles or other limitations. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (including Disqualified Stock, and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on _Indebtedness.”_",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.10,Note Guarantees,21.10.2,Subordination of the Note Guarantees,"The Note Guarantees will be senior subordinated indebtedness, which means that, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, the Note Guarantees will rank behind, and will be expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors, including any obligations under the Senior Secured Credit -172 ----- Facilities and any future Indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. As a result of this subordination, holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Guarantor will be entitled to receive full payment on all obligations owed to them before any payment can be made to Holders of the Notes in respect of such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date. For example, the ability of the Trustee or the Holders to take enforcement action with respect to the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain standstill provisions and payment blockage and other limitations on enforcement. The Trustee and the Holders will not be able to enforce the Note Guarantees until the expiration of the applicable standstill period (generally 179 days) for so long as amounts under Senior Indebtedness remain outstanding. For a description of the restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the sale of Bidco pursuant to an enforcement of security over shares of Bidco taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) of the Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes recover in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness.

Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

In addition, on the Issue Date, subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes and the Note Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured by: - on a first-priority basis, a share pledge in respect of the shares in the Issuer and any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Parent by the Issuer (the “SUN Collateral”) - on a second-priority basis, pledges of the shares in Bidco and any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer by Bidco (collectively, the “Shared Collateral” and, together with the SUN Collateral and the Escrow Charge, the “Collateral”). The Collateral and any other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Note Guarantees and the Indenture in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement constitute “Charged Property.” The Shared Collateral will secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on a senior basis to the Notes and Note Guarantees, and may also secure certain Hedging Obligations and certain future Indebtedness on a senior basis. The Collateral may also secure any Additional Notes and certain other future Indebtedness on a pari passu or junior basis.

Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement of, or certain distressed disposals of, the SUN Collateral on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. In addition, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement of, or certain distressed disposals of, the Shared Collateral only after any existing or future Indebtedness with a prior-ranking Lien on such Shared Collateral is repaid in full, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor _Agreement.”_ In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The circumstances in which the holders of the Notes may instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action in respect of the Security Interests over the Shared Collateral are significantly limited. Generally, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the holders of prior- ranking security interests in the Shared Collateral will be entitled to control virtually all decisions relating to the exercise of remedies with respect to these Security Interests, will be able to block enforcement of such Security Interests, will be able to release the Security Interests constituting Shared Collateral in certain circumstances and will receive any proceeds from the enforcement of those Security Interests before amounts will be available to the holders of the Notes. In general, the rights of the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf or on behalf of the holders of the Notes) to take enforcement action under the Transaction Security Documents with respect to the Shared Collateral will be subject to certain standstill provisions and payment blockage and other limitations on enforcement. The Trustee and the holders of the Notes may only act through the Security Agent and will not be able to independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the Transaction Security Documents or until the expiration of the applicable standstill period (being a period of up to 179 days subject to certain exceptions) and for so long as any amounts under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations and any such other Senior Indebtedness or obligations remain outstanding, force a sale of such Shared Collateral.

The Transaction Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent for itself and as agent for the secured parties. When entering into such Transaction Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws governing the creation and perfection of Security Interests and local court decisions, the relevant Transaction Security Documents will secure “parallel debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees). The parallel -177 ----- debt construct has not been fully tested under the law in certain of these jurisdictions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the _Notes—The Escrow Charge will be granted to the Trustee and the security interests in the remaining Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent, in each case, rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_ The Escrow Charge (pending release or Special Mandatory Redemption as described under “—Escrow of Proceeds; _Special Mandatory Redemption” above) will be granted solely for the benefit of the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of the_ Notes, and no other persons (including for the avoidance of doubt any lender under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, counterparties under any Hedging Obligations or any other creditors) will be entitled to benefit from the Escrow Charge. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Transaction Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent. In addition, prior to the discharge of obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations and other obligations constituting priority indebtedness under the Intercreditor Agreement, the representatives of the Holders will be subject to a 179-day standstill on the taking of any enforcement action over the Shared Collateral. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor _Agreement.”_ The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Charged Property until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Security—Release _of Liens.”_ In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Transaction Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Transaction Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests in _connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.”_",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitations on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the Permitted Holders, their respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Notes or derivative instruments related thereto, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities.

The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by the Relevant Clearing System, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such global Note (or any portion thereof). Under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a pro rata basis (such as by way of a pool factor), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate and in accordance with their applicable procedures (unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange rules); provided that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part. If the Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, the Notes will be selected on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of any Notes below €100,000. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made under this paragraph. Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a legal or covenant defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to the Holders of the Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. When the Notes are held in certificated form, a new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. When the Notes are held in the form of global notes, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note (or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems) to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

or (2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by any Payor or the Paying Agent on behalf of any Payor, with respect to any Note, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, such Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received by each Holder in respect of such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of: (1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any actual or deemed present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the -183 ----- Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place of management present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Note Guarantee; (2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before payment from which any such withholding or deduction is required would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so; (3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly. The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable efforts to provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of such other reasonable evidence as is available of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date).

79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.19,Change of Control,21.19.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a Change of Control Offer or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described in the seventh paragraph under this heading “—Change of Control,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (provided that Notes of €100,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control would entitle each lender under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (individually) to cancel its commitments and require prepayment of amounts outstanding to it under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and could trigger a change of control under other financing arrangements of the Group. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a change of control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a change of control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. -185 ----- Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

If and while the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating or a Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the relevant series of Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (in each case, to the extent given an Investment Grade Rating by such Rating Agency), then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Note Guarantees will be suspended during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Dispositions shall be reset to zero. During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to the extent provided for under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) and any Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the definitions of “Permitted Liens” and “Permitted Collateral Liens” and for no other covenant). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to exist or have occurred as a result of any failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any of the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period; provided, that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments (as defined herein) made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted _Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to an Applicable_ Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period); (2) all Indebtedness incurred, committed or issued during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (iv)(A) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness”; (3) any Affiliate Transaction (as defined herein) entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (vi) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”; (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”; (5) no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of _Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee or obligation entered into by_ such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; and (6) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made under clause (i) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.” Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period) and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Issuer shall not permit any Guarantor to, and no Guarantor shall Incur any Indebtedness that is or purports to be contractually subordinated (either by its terms or the terms of the agreement governing such Indebtedness) in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness ranks pari passu with such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or is also contractually subordinated (either by its terms or the terms of the agreement governing such Indebtedness) in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee; provided that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of the Notes or where such ranking or subordination arises as a matter of law; provided, further, that this limitation shall not apply to distinctions between categories of Senior Indebtedness that exist by reason of any Liens or Guarantees or the ordering of payment for any Liens or by virtue of being secured on a junior-priority basis (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Indebtedness incurred under any asset-backed loan facility or other facility secured on the Collateral on a junior-ranking basis to such Senior Indebtedness); provided, further, that and that Indebtedness under a Credit Facility that is Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor may provide for an ordering of payments among the tranches of such Credit Facility.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

(B) to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary); and/or (C) to make any Permitted Investment, in each case, within 455 days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition and (2) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided that: (1) in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to sub-clause (iii)(A) above, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) (other than in the case of any asset-based credit facility or any revolving credit facility (including a Revolving Facility)) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; (2) a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later than such 455[th] day shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment -204 ----- or letter of intent so long as the Issuer, or such Restricted Subsidiary, enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith expectation that such Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within the later of such 455th day and 180 days of such commitment or letter of intent (an “Acceptable Commitment”) or, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Available Cash is applied in connection therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Available Cash is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds; and (3) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with sub-clauses (iii)(A) to (iii)(C) above or otherwise in accordance with this covenant, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The following amount of Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture: (i) if the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset Disposition exceeds 4.95:1.00 on a pro forma basis, 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition; or (ii) if the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset Disposition exceeds 4.70:1.00 but does not exceed 4.95:1.00 on a pro forma basis, 50% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition; or (iii) if the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset Disposition does not exceed 4.70:1.00 on a pro forma basis, 0% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition; provided that: (A) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase any amount of Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, to the extent the creditors in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (including the Holders) elect not to tender their Pari Passu Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or purchase, the Issuer will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered under this clause (A), and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (such amount, together with the aggregate amount described under the fourth paragraph of this covenant, the “Declined Proceeds”); and (B) for the avoidance of doubt, Net Available Cash that will not constitute Excess Proceeds pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph above shall be immediately available to the Group for any purposes permitted by the Indenture, including to make Restricted Payments in accordance with clause (xxiv) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” without regard to the periods specified in clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant. On the 456[th] day (or such longer period permitted by the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under this covenant exceeds the greater of (x) €55.2 million and (y) an amount equal to 20% of LTM EBITDA in a single transaction, the Issuer will within 10 Business Days make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any other Pari Passu Indebtedness, to the holders or lenders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to (i) in the case of the Notes, 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and (ii) in the case of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness, the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement(s) governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 455 days (or such longer period provided above) (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”) with respect to all or part of the Net Available Cash (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”). -205 ----- If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes tendered and other Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders or lenders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Disposition Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall prepay, repay or purchase the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis (or otherwise in accordance with the Relevant Clearing System) based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Disposition Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Disposition Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the amount offered in the Asset Disposition Offer (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors or managers), (y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, or (z) a contribution or distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or to a Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is subject to a contractual encumbrance or restriction affecting the distribution and such encumbrance or restriction is not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. An Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees (but the Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. The provisions under the Indenture related to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro Equivalent amount determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer or another member of the Group becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of the lenders under such agreements to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes could constitute an Event of Default (subject to the relevant grace periods and other provisions described under “—Events of Default” below) under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Unless a contrary indication appears, a reference in the Note Documents to Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA, LTM EBITDA, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is to be construed as a reference to Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA, LTM EBITDA, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Group on a consolidated basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions set out in the Indenture), when calculating any Applicable Metric, the financial definitions or component thereof but excluding Excess Cash Flow, the Issuer shall be permitted to: (a) exclude all or any part of any expenditure or other negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from: (i) the Transaction; (ii) any other acquisition, Investment or other joint venture permitted by the terms of the Indenture or the impact from purchase price accounting; (iii) start-up costs for new businesses and branding or re-branding of existing businesses; (iv) Restructuring Costs; (v) research and development expenditure (and the capitalization thereof); and/or (vi) the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and/or IFRS 16 (Leases) and, in each case, any successor standard thereto (or any equivalent measure under the accounting principles) or any other changes in the applicable accounting principles; and/or (b) include any addbacks (without further verification or diligence) for adjustments (including anticipated Synergies) or costs or expenses of a type included in “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” in this offering memorandum or otherwise related to the Transaction and/or any base case model or quality of earnings report relating to a Permitted Acquisition prepared by an independent third party and/or taken into account in determining “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” or any financing EBITDA to be used in connection with financing for a Permitted Acquisition and/or any research and development expenditure (which is not otherwise capitalized). When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in connection with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall, at the option of the Issuer, be any Applicable Test Date. If the Issuer elects to determine any Applicable Metric as of any Applicable Test Date, it shall give pro forma effect to any other Applicable Transactions that have occurred up to (and including) such Applicable Test Date. If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph, such Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that (a) the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and (b) save as contemplated in clause (a) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto. If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations. If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing). Subject to clause (viii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” in calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to the Applicable Transaction following the relevant Applicable Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Applicable Transaction is consummated or the Issuer determines (in its sole discretion) that such Applicable Transaction will not be consummated, any such Applicable Metric shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Applicable Transaction. If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed, Incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is tested in reliance -218 ----- on a ratio-based basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio or any other ratio-based Applicable Metric, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the Incurrence or drawing of any Indebtedness under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee facility and/or other debt which is available to be re-drawn (including under any Revolving Facility or any ancillary facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement), in each case, to the extent drawn for working capital purposes and, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to clause (viii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a Revolving Facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric. If, in connection with the same Applicable Transaction or otherwise substantially simultaneously: (a)(i) any Applicable Metrics required to be determined by reference to a fixed currency amount or a percentage of LTM EBITDA (a “fixed permission”) are intended to be utilized; and/or (ii) revolving Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness under the Reserved Indebtedness Amount) is intended to be Incurred; and (b) any Applicable Metric required to be determined by reference to the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or any other ratio-based Applicable Metric (a “ratio-based permission”) are intended to be utilized (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination of any increase or decrease in any such Applicable Metric, including in accordance with the clauses (v)(B)(1)(I), (v)(B)(1)(II) or (v)(B)(1)(III) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”), then (x) amounts available to be incurred under the applicable ratio-based permissions shall first be calculated without giving effect to amounts to be incurred under the applicable fixed permissions or the applicable Incurrence of revolving Indebtedness, or amounts previously incurred under such fixed permissions and not reclassified that are being repaid in connection with such Applicable Transaction, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer; and (y) thereafter, compliance with any relevant fixed permissions shall be calculated, and in each case, full pro forma effect shall be given to all increases to LTM EBITDA and repayments or discharges of Indebtedness in connection with such Applicable Transaction in accordance with the Indenture. If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “numerical permission”) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the “grower permission”) and the grower permission of the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a result of a Permitted Acquisition or Permitted Investment, the numerical permission shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time as a result of any such Permitted Acquisitions and/or Permitted Investments and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower permission. In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one Applicable Metric, the Issuer may (in its sole discretion), subject to the limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” classify and reclassify that amount or transaction to a particular Applicable Metric and will only be required to include that amount or transaction in one of those Applicable Metrics (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount may at the option of the Issuer be split between different Applicable Metrics). Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission. The Indenture will provide that references to (i) any matter being “permitted” under the Indenture or any other Note Document shall include references to such matters not being prohibited or otherwise being approved under the Indenture or such other Note Document and (ii) any transaction being in the “ordinary course of business” of a member of the Group shall be construed to include any transaction that is consistent with industry practice in the industries in which the Group operates or consistent with past practice of any member of the Group or the Target Group. For purposes of determining compliance with: (i) any euro-denominated Applicable Metric (other than in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or ratio under the Note Documents or related usage, ratchet or permission), the euro equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated using a rate of exchange selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the Applicable Test Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rate of any foreign exchange hedging entered into by the Group in relation to the Applicable Transaction); or (ii) any other Applicable Metric (including in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or ratio under the Note Documents), the euro equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated, at the Issuer’s option, using any of: (A) any applicable weighted average spot conversion rates over the relevant testing period; (B) any applicable conversion rates used in any relevant financial statements or management accounts; (C) any applicable conversion rate selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the relevant date of determination (including the Applicable Test Date, if applicable); or (D) any applicable conversion rate under any foreign exchange hedging arrangement entered into by any member of the Group, and, in each case, no Default, Event of Default or any breach of representation or warranty or undertaking shall arise merely as a result of a subsequent change in the euro equivalent amount of any relevant amount due to fluctuations in exchange rates. -219 ----- For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a Relevant Period, a fourquarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”): (i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and (ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount. For the purpose of this section and to the extent any Applicable Metric is used as the basis (in whole or in part) for permitting any transaction or making any determination under the Indenture (including on a pro forma basis) no item shall be included or excluded more than once where to do so would result in double counting.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request thereof (a “Verification Covenant”).

If there is any breach of the Position Representation or failure to satisfy its Verification Covenant in accordance with a final and non-appealable court determination or order, then for purposes of determining the requisite level of consent for such Noteholder Direction, that breaching Holder’s position shall be treated as “not outstanding” for purposes of determining the denominator in the calculation of the requisite level of consent (and their position may not also be included in the numerator); and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction (provided that the relevant Position Representations are provided in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph) or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any Agent) shall not be liable to any party howsoever arising for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in good faith (provided that the Trustee’s conduct does not constitute gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud). The Trustee shall have no obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has a Net Short position, (ii) investigate the merits, validity, accuracy or authenticity of any position representation or Officer’s Certificate, as the case may be, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its position representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any derivative instruments, Net Short position, long derivative instrument, short derivative instrument or otherwise. If an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this section occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Transaction Security Documents except as provided in such Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant titled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clauses (c), (d) or (f) of the first paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant; -224 ----- (2) Holders, or in the case of clauses (c), (d) or (f) of the first paragraph of this section, Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders, or Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation (as applicable) have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines (after consultation with counsel) is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) after the end of each fiscal year (or in the case of the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date, 150 days), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that has occurred during the previous year, and is continuing. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events that are continuing of which it is aware the occurrence of which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form (subject to very limited exceptions) and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holder” of the Notes under the Indenture for any purpose. So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or its respective nominee), will be considered the holder of the Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the Indenture. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests. In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law. In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of one -282 ----- Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed; provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee and the applicable Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We and/or the Trustee may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their respective operational procedures; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount at maturity may be redeemed in part.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents are responsible for those operations or procedures. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.

79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.48,CERTAIN TAX CONSEQUENCES German Taxation,21.48.1,Withholding Tax,"_Resident Holders_ Ongoing interest payments received by an individual holder of the Notes who is a German tax resident (i.e. persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management is located in Germany) will be subject to German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Notes are kept or administered in a custodial account with or presented for an over the counter payment to a German branch of a German or non-German bank or financial services institution, a German securities trading company or a German securities trading bank or if no German bank or financial institution is the Disbursing Agent, the Issuer (each, a “Disbursing Agent,” inländische auszahlende Stelle). The withholding tax rate to be withheld by the Disbursing Agent is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable). Church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the holder has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für _Steuern) in which case the holders will have to include the income in the tax return and will then be assessed for church tax._ The Issuers of the Notes should under German law not be required to deduct withholding tax from the proceeds of the investment in the Notes. The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition taking into account currency gains and losses, if any) and interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest,” Stückzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a German tax resident irrespective of any holding period provided that the Notes have been held in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e., without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the redemption of interest coupons or the payment of interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately. To the extent that the Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any), unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution within the European Union, the EEA or the countries/territories Luxembourg, Austria, the Swiss Confederation, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Republic of San Marino, the Principality of Monaco, the Principality of Andorra, Curacao and Sint Maarten. If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax resident individual holder may also apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs; however, in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds a German tax resident individual holder is obliged to apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs. In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent. Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent, the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld from the gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the competent tax authorities. -287 ----- German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German tax resident (including via a commercial partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax authorities) while ongoing payments, such as interest payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The same may apply where the Notes form part of a trade or business (of an individual or of a commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met. _Non-Resident Holders_ Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income and the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German taxation (as outlined below under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non Tax Residents”) and the Notes are held in a custodial account with a German Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain circumstances. The withholding tax may be refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen). Furthermore, payments made to a holder resident in a so-called “non-cooperative jurisdiction” (nicht kooperatives _Steuerhoheitsgebiet) may be subject to a tax deduction by the Issuer in Germany at a rate of 15% (plus solidarity surcharge) of_ the gross payment pursuant to the Defence against Tax Havens Act (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem _Steuerwettbewerb und zur Änderung weiterer Gesetze—“StAbwG”) which was passed by the Bundesrat on June 25, 2021_ (see BR-Drs. 509/21(B) and BGBl. I p. 2056). The exact scope of this new law, in particular the application to third party financings, is, however, unclear.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.48,CERTAIN TAX CONSEQUENCES German Taxation,21.48.2,Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains,"_Tax Resident Holder_ This subsection “—Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is located in Germany). Income derived from capital investments under the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatvermögen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene _Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are_ not deductible. The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under “—Withholding Tax” above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes kept in custody abroad or if no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process or if the withholding tax on disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than the actual gain), the individual holder must include its interest income and capital gains derived from the Notes in its annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income of a given year at its lower individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted. Losses incurred with respect to the Notes may only be offset with investment income of the individual holder realized in the same or following assessment periods. Pursuant to recent legislative changes, losses arising from a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall), a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht) or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a third-party or from any other default can only be offset against other income from capital investments and only up to an amount of €20,000 per year. Respective losses exceeding the amount of €20,000 can be carried forward and might be usable in future tax periods (together with current capital investment losses of each such tax period) up to an amount of €20,000 per year. Given that this offset with losses will not be applied by the Disbursing Agent (as defined above) holding the Notes in custody, holders suffering losses are required to declare such losses in their income tax return. Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or the income from the Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective holder must include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business -288 ----- the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz) applicable to the holder. If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method. _Non-Tax Resident Holder_ This subsection “—Non-Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management and control is not located in Germany). Interest and capital gains (which include Accrued Interest and currency gains and losses, if any) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax resident in Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income (such as income from the letting and leasing of certain German situs property or income from capital investments directly or indirectly secured by German situs real estate or income from a hybrid instrument issued by a German tax resident issuer, unless the Notes qualify as global certificates (Sammelurkunden) within the meaning of Section 9a of the German Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen)). We expect the Notes to qualify for this exception so long as they are held in global form. In cases (i) and (ii) a tax regime similar to that explained above under “—Tax Residents” applies. Furthermore, the holders who are not tax resident in Germany may become subject to German withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of an over the counter payment by a German Disbursing Agent and the Notes are not held in custody with the same German Disbursing Agent. Subject to certain requirements a holder who is not tax resident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided by an applicable tax treaty. Where the Issuer makes a tax deduction from a payment to a holder of the Notes tax resident in a non-cooperative jurisdiction under the StAbwG (as set forth under “—Withholding Tax”), such holder should in principle incur a definitive tax charge.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

The solidarity surcharge, however, continues to apply for capital investments and, thus, on withholding taxes levied.

In such event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the indenture governing the Notes. Such a modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such modifications (“New Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange, such a deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which certain beneficial owners of the Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss. The amount of any gain or loss recognized upon such a deemed exchange of a Note for a New Note would be determined by reference to the “issue price” of the New Note. The issue price of a New Note will equal the fair market value of such Note or such New Note at the time of the deemed exchange if, as seems likely, such Note or such New Note were considered “publicly traded” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IPO Debt Pushdown is treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder’s holding period in a New Note treated as received in the IPO Debt Pushdown generally will commence on the day after the IPO Debt Pushdown, and tax basis in such New Note would generally equal the issue price of such New Note. Generally, any gain or loss recognized as a result of such deemed exchange will be taxed under the rules described below under “—Sale, Exchange or _Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes.” If the issue price of such New Note is less than its stated redemption price at_ maturity by more than a de minimis amount, such New Note will be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. Holders would be required to include that OID in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the Notes in connection with the IPO Debt Pushdown, including the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange and resulting OID, if any.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.49,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,21.49.2,Additional Payments,"In certain circumstances (see, e.g., “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” “Description of the Notes— _Optional Redemption,” “Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”) we may be obligated or elect_ to pay amounts in excess of stated interest and principal on the Notes. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of such additional amounts payable on the Notes is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations as of the date hereof, and thus does not result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless such holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, among other adverse tax consequences, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue income on its Notes based on a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of the Notes. In addition, a U.S. Holder may be required to treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain some or all of any income recognized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement, or other taxable disposition of the Notes, and, with respect to a U.S. Holder of a Note, to recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such income in a manner different than that described below. In the event a contingency occurs, the amount, timing and character of a U.S. Holder’s income, gain or loss with respect to the Notes may be affected. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisor regarding the tax consequences if the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The discussion below assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.49,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,21.49.3,Payments of Stated Interest,"We expect, and this discussion assumes, that the Notes will not be considered as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Notes generally will be treated as issued without OID if the difference between their principal amount and their issue price is less than the product of one fourth of one percent (0.25 percent) of their principal amount multiplied by the number of full years to their maturity. In general, however, if the Notes are issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder will be required to include OID in gross income, as ordinary income, under a “constant-yield method” before the receipt of cash attributable to such income, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, payments of stated interest on the Notes (as well as any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. Holder of the Notes that uses the cash method of tax accounting will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro denominated interest payment on the Notes based on the spot rate of -291 ----- exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars on that date. No foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be recognized with respect to the receipt of such payment, but such U.S. Holder may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros so received. A U.S. Holder of the Notes that uses the accrual method of tax accounting (or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will accrue interest income on the Notes in euro and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on either: - the average spot rate of exchange in effect during the interest accrual period, or portion thereof, within such U.S. Holder’s taxable year; or - at such U.S. Holder’s election (a “Spot Rate Convention Election”), at the spot rate of exchange on (1) the last day of the accrual period, or the last day of the taxable year within such accrual period if the accrual period spans more than one taxable year, or (2) the date of receipt, if such date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. Such election must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisor regarding the advisability of making the Spot Rate Convention Election. Whether or not the Spot Rate Convention Election is made, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), a U.S. Holder of the Notes that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the Notes on the receipt of an interest payment equal to the difference between (i) the value of the euro received as interest, as translated into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars on such date, and (ii) the U.S. dollar amount previously included in income with respect to such payment. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss. _Foreign Tax Credits_ Interest attributable to the Notes generally will be income from sources outside of the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income or, in certain cases, general category income. Any non-U.S. withholding tax with respect to the Notes held by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.49,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,21.49.4,"Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes","Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, except as noted below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized by such U.S. Holder (except to the extent such amount is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as described above under “—Payments of Stated Interest”) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Note, in each case as determined in U.S. dollars. Subject to the discussion below, the adjusted tax basis of a Note to a U.S. Holder will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price of that Note calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase. The amount realized by a U.S. Holder upon the disposition of a Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro received calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. If the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting, and if it so elects, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting, will determine the U.S. dollar values of its adjusted tax bases in a Note and the amount realized on the disposition of a Note by translating euro amounts at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or the disposition, respectively. The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders discussed above must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder of Notes that does not make the special election generally will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Note exceeds one year on the date of disposition. Long term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders generally are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. Capital gain or loss, if any, recognized by a U.S. Holder generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss for purposes of calculating the U.S. foreign tax credit limitation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. -292 ----- Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is attributable to changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate with respect to the principal amount of such Note during the period in which the U.S. Holder held such Note. For these purposes, the “principal amount” of a Note is the U.S. Holder’s foreign currency purchase price of the Note. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date (1) the Note is disposed of (or the spot rate on the settlement date, if applicable) and (2) of purchase (or the spot rate on the settlement date, if applicable). In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to previously accrued but unpaid interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” The recognition of foreign currency exchange gain or loss described in this paragraph will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of a Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Any such gain or loss generally will be ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as interest income or expense, except to the extent provided by administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Foreign currency received as interest on a Note or on the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will have a tax basis equal to its U.S. dollar value at the time the foreign currency is received (except that foreign currency received from the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note that is traded on an established securities market will have a tax basis equal to its U.S. dollar value on the trade date in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer that does not make the election described above).",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

However, under proposed U.S. -293 ----- Treasury regulations issued in December 2018 (and upon which taxpayers may rely until final regulations are issued), such withholding does not apply to any “foreign passthru payment” that is made before the date that is two years after the date on which applicable final U.S. Treasury regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are issued. Additionally, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are issued generally would be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are materially modified more than six months after such date. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, applicable final Treasury Regulations have not yet been issued. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into, and others are expected to enter into, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein.

Accordingly, a beneficial owner of a Note that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “non-U.S. holder”) should not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to the Notes. Because, however, a portion of the net proceeds of this offering is expected to be directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer to a U.S. subsidiary and used in the United States to repay existing debt, the IRS may successfully assert that there is a potential tax avoidance plan and that all or a portion of any payment of interest on the Notes should be treated as from sources within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In that case, a non-U.S. holder may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) with respect to interest payments on the Notes unless certain certification requirements have been fulfilled (such as providing applicable IRS W-8 Forms). We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS with respect to the tax treatment of the Notes and there can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position concerning the tax treatment described in this paragraph. We currently do not intend to withhold on any payment made with respect to the Notes to non-U.S. holders. However, in the event that the interest income were treated as from sources within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purpose, we or the applicable withholding agent may withhold on payments made with respect to the Notes to non-U.S. holders unless the certification requirements described above are met, and we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld. In that connection, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes, by its purchase and acceptance of the Notes, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows: (a) if such holder or beneficial owner is not a United States person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, (i) such holder or beneficial owner qualifies for an exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to payments of interest pursuant to an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party; or (ii)(x) such holder or beneficial owner does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the Issuer’s voting stock within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3) of the Code; (y) such holder or beneficial owner is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Issuer through actual or constructive stock ownership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and (z) such holder or beneficial owner is not a bank; (b) such holder or beneficial owner (and any intermediary through which such holder or beneficial owner holds the Notes) qualifies for an exemption from any taxes imposed under the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (which shall, for this purpose, refer to any taxes imposed under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (and any amended or successor version), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code, or any law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing); (c) such holder or beneficial owner is able to provide any required U.S. tax documentation to certify to the foregoing representations or to such holder’s or beneficial owner’s status as a United States person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code upon reasonable request by the Issuer or an applicable withholding agent; (d) such holder or beneficial owner agrees to give to each person to whom such holder or beneficial owner transfers the Notes notice of its requirement to meet the foregoing tax representations and documentation requirements.

The summary does not address any U.S. federal income tax consequences to Non-U.S. Holders relating to the Notes, nor does it address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the federal income tax laws of the United States, including the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof and other applicable authorities, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect which could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes than those discussed herein or that any such position would not be sustained in the event of litigation. A different treatment than that assumed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss, or otherwise result in adverse tax consequences, in respect of an investment in the Notes. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more “United States persons” (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if the trust has a valid election in place to be treated as a “United States person” (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code). This summary is general in nature and does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a U.S. Holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or special tax accounting rules that apply as a result of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account on an applicable financial statement. In addition, this summary does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to U.S. Holders that are subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address tax consequences to banks, broker dealers, mutual funds, certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement and other tax deferred accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships, subchapter S corporations, or other pass through entities or arrangements and investors in such entities or arrangements, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, and persons who own, actually or under applicable constructive ownership rules, 10% or more of our ordinary shares (by vote or value). In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes in the offering hereby at the “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of such Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers), and who hold the Notes as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. If any entity or arrangement which is treated as a partnership (or other pass through entity) for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner or member in the partnership (or other pass through entity) generally will depend upon the status of the partner or member and the activities of the partner or member and the partnership (or other pass through entity). A partnership (or other pass through entity) considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. The summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations set forth below is for general information purposes only. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and the applicability of any applicable tax treaty. -290 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

The Notes will be issued by CTEC II GmbH, a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter _Haftung) organized under the laws of Germany, having its registered office at Schwanthalerstraße 73, 80336 Munich,_ Germany, and registered with the commercial register (Handelsregister) of the local court (Amtsgericht) of Munich under registration number HRB 267748 (the “Issuer”). For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” (i) the “Issuer” refers only to CTEC II GmbH, and none of its subsidiaries, (ii) the “Target Group” refers to CeramTec TopCo GmbH (the “Target”), together with its Subsidiaries, and (iii) the “Group” refers to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, collectively. The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date, among, inter _alios, the Issuer, Bidco, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), and Deutsche Bank AG, London_ Branch, as security agent (the “Security Agent”). The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and will be subject to certain terms restricting their transfer. See “Notice to _Investors.” The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, and Holders are referred to the_ Indenture for a statement thereof. The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below), and in the case of a conflict between the Indenture, the Notes or the Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, enforcement standstill, payment blockages, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— _Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._ The Issuer will not be required to, nor does the Issuer currently intend to, offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for resale under the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, or incorporate by reference or include, or be subject to, any provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) thereof. Accordingly, the terms of the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture, and the Holders will not be entitled to the protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships between it and us. The Issuer will, concurrently with the closing of the Offering of Notes on the Issue Date, deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account (as defined below) pending consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below. Following release from the Escrow Account in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, as further described below, the proceeds from the offering of the Notes issued on the Issue Date, together with proceeds from the Senior Term Facilities and the Equity Contribution, will be used to (i) fund the consideration payable for the Acquisition and repay certain net Existing Target Debt, including amounts outstanding Existing Credit Facilities and Existing Notes, and (ii) to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions, as set forth in this offering memorandum under “Use _of Proceeds.” In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined below) occurs and the Escrow Agent and the Trustee_ (each, as defined below) shall not have received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) on or prior to such date or (ii) the Issuer informs the Escrow Agent and the Trustee in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes at a price equal to 100% of the issue price of the Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See “—Escrow of _Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_ Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and Bidco and will not be guaranteed by any member of the Target Group. Within 120 days from the Business Day immediately after the Acquisition Closing Date, and subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Post-Closing Guarantors (as defined below) are expected to accede to the Indenture (as defined below) and the Intercreditor Agreement and guarantee the Notes on a senior subordinated basis. Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, neither the Issuer nor Bidco will control the Target Group, and no member of the Target Group will be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of the Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Target Group will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities as of the Issue Date, and any such non-compliance will not constitute a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture if occurring prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring. The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,64,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS,64.1,European Union,64.1.2,,"The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Germany, which is a Member States of the European Union. Pursuant to Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), and starting from June 26, 2017, which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the court which shall have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company organized under the laws of a Member State is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings, which are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. The “centre of main interests” is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its “centre of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary (which presumption shall not apply if the registered office has been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1), second sentence, of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the “centre of main interests” shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “which is ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the “centre of main interests” of a company in that respect, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office, and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established. If the centre of main interests of a company is and will remain located in a Member State in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings initiated in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are automatically recognized in the Member States (other than Denmark), although territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State, subject to the conditions set out below. If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a company carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in another Member State will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the three month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its “centre of main interests” have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the company’s “centre of main interests” is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial (secondary) proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local -296 ----- insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s “centre of main interest” is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. The insolvency practitioner may, in particular, remove the debtor’s assets from the territory of the Member State in which they are situated. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the company (as debtor-in-possession) or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. The EU Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of the group’s members. The EU Insolvency Regulations provides - for cooperation between (i) insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings, (ii) jurisdictions and (iii) jurisdictions and insolvency practitioners; - for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group; - that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and -297 ----- - that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers. In the event that the Issuer or a Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,64,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS,64.2,Germany,64.2.1,Insolvency,"The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany: Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due for a period longer than three weeks. According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on a 12 months’ forecast horizon (positive Fortführungsprognose). If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or a partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) or limited liability partnership not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or partner (e.g., GmbH & Co. KG) finds itself in a situation of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or over indebtedness (Überschuldung), each managing director or general partner (in the case of a partnership) of such person and, in certain circumstances, its shareholders or members of the supervisory board, are obligated to file for insolvency without undue delay but not later than three weeks after such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or six weeks after such over indebtedness (Überschuldung) occurred or (as the case may be) was established. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damages claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings or for restructuring proceedings (see “—Preventive Restructuring Framework”) in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk of the company being unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due at_ some point in time within a prognosis period of usually 24 months, whereas imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit) does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings._ The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID 19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (as amended from time to time, the “COVInsAG”), provided, inter alia, for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency until April 30, 2021. The suspension—as in force from January 1, 2021 until April 30, 2021—applied to debtors who, in the period from November 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021, have applied for financial assistance under state assistance programs to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic or have been prevented, as eligible debtors, from filing such application for financial assistance for legal or factual reasons, unless the insolvency is not caused by consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and there is obviously no prospect of obtaining the state financial assistance or the assistance that can be obtained is insufficient to eliminate the over-indebtedness or illiquidity. If the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of filing duties, the COVInsAG also provides for a certain relief from claw back provisions for the satisfaction of claims or the provision of collateral for these claims, which the creditor was entitled to receive and unless the creditor knew that the restructuring and refinancing efforts of the debtor were not suitable to eliminate an existing illiquidity of the debtor in the meaning of section 17 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Furthermore, for an interim period until December 31, 2021, the COVInsAG reduces the forecast period (Fortführungsprognose) relevant for determining whether a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for the purposes of the assessment of the insolvency ground of over-indebtedness from twelve months to four months provided that the debtor’s over-indebtedness is caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which is assumed if (i) the debtor was not illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) as of December 31, 2019, (ii) the debtor’s result from its ordinary business activity was positive in the last financial year prior to January 1, 2020, and (iii) the revenue from the debtors’ ordinary business activity in calendar year 2020 was more than 30% lower than the revenue in calendar year 2019. Further, following heavy rainfall and floodings in parts of Germany in July 2021, on September 7, 2021 the German Bundestag passed an Act to establish a special fund “Aufbauhilfe 2021” of up to EUR 30 billion to finance aids for private households, companies and other facilities affected by the heavy rainfall and floodings (Aufbauhilfegesetz 2021—AufbhG _2021). To further supplement those financial measures, the above-mentioned Act also contains a temporary suspension of the_ obligation to file for insolvency until January 31, 2022 (which may be extended until April 30, 2022) if a debtor’s illiquidity or over-indebtedness directly results from the impact of the heavy rainfall and floodings in July 2021 and the relevant debtor conducts serious financing or restructuring negotiations and therefore has reasonable prospects for a successful reconstruction. A company may also file for preliminary “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung), if, in general, the company has developed a comprehensive and conclusive turn-around plan to be implemented by way of debtor-in-possession proceedings and the insolvency court is not aware of any circumstances that indicate that key aspects of the filed turn-around plan are based on incorrect assumptions. If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or is over-indebted (überschuldet), but not illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), it may also file for_ preliminary “debtor-in-possession” protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren), unless—from a third party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan, which ideally shall be implemented in -299 ----- formal “debtor-in- possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. During the period of either the preliminary debtor-in-possession proceedings (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung) or the protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren), the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan, which ideally shall be implemented in formal “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). In particular, the insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings (other than with respect to immoveable assets) or, to the extent required to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business, prohibit the enforcement of any collateral granted over claims, rights or other movable assets of debtor. If the enforcement of collateral is prohibited by the insolvency court, secured creditors have to be adequately compensated by the insolvency estate. Unless the debtor has applied for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger _Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator or the preliminary trustee depend on the decision_ of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may include safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), whilst in debtor-in-possession proceedings, the debtor’s management retains the right to manage business. However, the court may also order that certain disposals of the debtor may require the preliminary trustee’s (vorläufiger Sachwalter) consent also in debtor-in-possession proceedings. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three requirements: - a balance sheet total of at least €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted); - revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing; and/or - fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis (including, inter alios, part time employees). The requirements are assessed with reference to the entity subject to the proceedings only without taking into account the assets of other group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will, for example, have the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) / preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) / trustee (Sachwalter); and court orders for “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung). The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (drohend zahlungsunfähig) (if the petition has been filed by the debtor), illiquidity (zahlungsunfähig) and/or over indebtedness (überschuldet) and (ii) if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient to cover such costs, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Unless the court has granted “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor), upon opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial. Individual creditors, or the debtor, can request the insolvency court to remove the insolvency administrator only on the grounds of a lack of impartiality and only within six months from the appointment. The insolvency administrator (or in the case of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which will be preferred to any unsecured insolvency liabilities created by the debtor including, e.g., the Note Guarantees. Residual claims of a secured insolvency creditors remaining after realization of the respective collateral (if any) also qualify as unsecured insolvency claim in this regard. However, in “debtor-in-possession” proceedings, the debtor shall only incur estate liabilities in the ordinary course of business without the trustee’s (Sachwalter) consent. -300 ----- Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance. The insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (or trustee (Sachwalter) in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings) may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer”). For the holders of the Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency proceedings over the assets of any Relevant German Entity would include, among possible voidance actions and other things, the following: (a) unless the court orders “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of the Relevant German Entity’s assets would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate; (b) unless the court orders “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by the Relevant German Entity’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law; (c) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the relevant insolvency debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (d) claims against the relevant debtor may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and (e) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute a part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter). Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. Under German insolvency and restructuring law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or restructuring proceedings or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency or restructuring proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte _oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid in case of insolvency proceedings if such clause would frustrate the election right of the_ insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless such clause only reflects termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors (Massegläubiger) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and the rights they claim in the assets of the debtor with the insolvency administrator. With the exception of certain secured creditors, an individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings are opened). German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, all unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security interests after insolvency proceedings have been commenced to the extent the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral but have only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency proceedings. In this case, secured creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus costs and fees) from such realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured creditor remains entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security: The insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its possession that are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) and (ii) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). According to some voices in legal literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of pledged uncertificated -301 ----- shares on their own or, insofar as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. However, there is no authoritative case law on this question. That having been said, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) views the insolvency administrator competent to realize pledged shares in a corporation that have been certificated (verbrieft) and are hold in a custodian account (Depot) in Germany in case the shares represent more than 20% in the issued share capital of the pledged company. It therefore appears likely that in this particular case, secured creditors would not be held competent to realize the respective share pledges. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds (Ersatzabsonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges of 9% (or as agreed upon individually, but in any case at least 4%) for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the secured assets are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts (“excess proceeds”) will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) (being the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (e.g., fees for and expenses of the preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) and the insolvency court as well as the members of the (preliminary) creditors’ committee) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including the holders of the Notes (to the extent not satisfied after enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes). If a Relevant German Entity or a subsidiary thereof subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of creditors secured by such security (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the respective Note Guarantee by the respective Relevant German Entity after such secured creditors have been satisfied. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules. In addition, it may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator or, in debtor-in-possession proceedings, by the trustee (upon instruction of the preliminary creditors’ committee or the creditors’ meeting) and which requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. The insolvency court may order the deemed approval of one or more opposing creditor groups under certain conditions (cram down). The insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) may derogate from the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In particular, it may contain provisions regarding the discharge of secured and unsecured creditors, the disposal of the insolvency estate as well as procedure. It may also create, modify, transfer or terminate rights in rem such as property rights or security interests. If the debtor is a corporate entity, the shares or, as the case may be, the partnership interests in the debtor can also be included in the insolvency plan, including an issuance of shares or partnership interests to third parties or to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an insolvency plan could under certain circumstances provide for provisions, inter alia, regarding the Notes or the Note Guarantees or the Collateral which are less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), such as the release of the Collateral or the release of obligations under the Notes or the Note Guarantees. Under certain conditions, such provisions could be adopted against the votes of the affected holders of the Notes. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt-for-equity swap under the proposed insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). An insolvency plan can further provide for the release or other impairment of guarantees or other security interests provided by debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten), without such debtor affiliates being required to become subject of the debtor’s or separate insolvency proceedings, provided that the relevant debtor affiliate consents to the impairment. Creditors affected by such impairment are entitled to receive adequate compensation. This means that the claims under the Note Guarantees can get impaired if a Relevant German Entity would enter into German insolvency proceedings, regardless of whether or not the Relevant German Entity is itself subject of insolvency proceedings. Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis à vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. However, the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) has provisions to facilitate the coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. Whereas these provisions do not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, they stipulate four key measures in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppengerichtsstand); (ii) a -302 ----- single person may be appointed as insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) for all relevant group companies; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordinator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan) for approval by the coordination court (Koordinationsgericht). As a general principle, the claims arising from the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be enforced against a Relevant German Entity outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Relevant German Entity. Any insolvency proceedings over the assets of a Relevant German Entity would, however, be a rather strong indication that the overall financial situation of the entire group of affiliated companies has significantly deteriorated, which may cause other Relevant German Entity or other affiliated companies to subsequently file for insolvency. German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions, but except for government developments banks and its affiliates). The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the Indenture may result in the holders of the Notes and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a “shareholder like” position (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of a Relevant German Entity, the claims arising from the Notes or a Note Guarantee could be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of a Relevant German Entity unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to claims of regular, unsecured creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,64,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS,64.2,Germany,64.2.2,Hardening periods and fraudulent transfer,"Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or, in the event that “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) have been granted, the trustee (Sachwalter) may also challenge (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during the applicable voidance periods. The administrator’s or the trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders of Notes as well as the granting of Collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) or, as the case may be, a trustee (Sachwalter) under the rules of avoidance as set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). If the validity or enforceability of the Notes, the respective Note Guarantees or any Collateral in favor of the Notes is challenged successfully, the holder of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes, the respective Note Guarantees or the relevant Collateral. If payments have already been made under the Notes, the respective Note Guarantees or Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. In this case, holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes or relevant Note Guarantee without preference in insolvency proceedings. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases: - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (a) during the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig)) at such time, or (b) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or filing); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings; - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (a) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (b) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at such time or (c) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of -303 ----- insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental effect); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the detrimental nature of such transaction for other creditors; - any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (a) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at such time or (b) after the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or such filing at the time of the transaction (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or filing); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings; - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security (including a guarantee) for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings; - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to prejudice the insolvency creditors if the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was at least imminent (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. For granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled, such knowledge is (solely) presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) (as opposed to the knowledge of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in regular cases) and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. Apart from that, such acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) (whether or not it was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction), may only be avoided if they were effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at a time after the filing. There is a rebuttable presumption that, if the debtor reached a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with the creditor or the creditor granted any other form of deferred payment (Zahlungserleichterungen) to the debtor, he had no knowledge of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at the time of the transaction; - any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person), as described below, which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be challenged unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; - any act that grants security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim under a shareholder loan granted to the debtor or an equivalent claim if (a) in the case of the granting of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (b) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. This does not apply (a) to shareholders that own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged in management and (b) until the sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige Sanierung) of the debtor in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity with the intension to restructure the debtor; and - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction to a third party for a loan claim or an equivalent claim if (a) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (b) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security for such loan or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder Bürge) for such loan (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that, e.g., the respective debtor (e.g., a Relevant German Entity) was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. Knowledge of pending restructuring -304 ----- proceedings (see—“Preventive Restructuring Framework”) per se does not suffice for a creditor to be deemed to have such “knowledge.” A person is further deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted an insolvency creditor, or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words “imminent illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the preceding sentence have to be replaced by “actual illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). With respect to an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as described below there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge” as indicated above. In relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons. The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt funded as new money may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such be privileged. Meaning, under certain circumstances it may not be subject to avoidance rights under the German Insolvency Code (Bargeschäftsprivileg). According to recent case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), however, this privilege does not apply to claims under a shareholder loan agreement or economically equivalent transactions as described above. Furthermore, any transactions contemplated by a restructuring plan (see—“Preventive Restructuring Framework”) are not subject to avoidance actions until a sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige Sanierung) of the debtor is achieved, unless the restructuring plan was based on incorrect or incomplete information presented by the debtor and the addressee of the avoidance action had knowledge thereof. This privilege does not apply to shareholder loans or economically similar transactions or collateral provided therefor. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable towards another creditor if (i) such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency (for which knowledge of pendent restructuring proceedings (see —“Preventive Restructuring Framework”) per se does not suffice) at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted and (ii) the other creditor suffered losses caused by a delayed filing for insolvency based on the additional or extended existing funding. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, e.g., the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. If, however, such was additional funding has been provided or existing funding has been extended or respective collateral has been granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (in certain cases, until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021), any such transaction is statutorily exempted from the lender liability concept as laid out above. The COVInsAG provides for privileged treatment of new financing and shareholder loans under German insolvency law claw-back provisions during a certain time during the COVID-19 pandemic. On that basis, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by before September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time. This privilege also covers the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral to secure the repayment of shareholder loans or receivables resulting from legal transactions which are economically equivalent to such a loan.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,64,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS,64.2,Germany,64.2.4,Preventive restructuring framework,"The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG). In transforming the EU Restructuring Directive (see “—European Union—EU directive on preventative _restructuring frameworks”) into national law, the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has come into_ force on January 1, 2021 in Germany. The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a new pre-insolvency procedure to restructure the liabilities of debtors, whose “centre of main interest” is located in Germany. This may apply as of the date of this offering memorandum to certain of the Guarantors as well as to the Issuer. As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1, 2021, little corresponding (court) practice exists as of the date of this offering memorandum and consequently any proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) come with uncertainty. For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of an initiation of restructuring proceedings by a Relevant German Entity having its “centre of main interest” in Germany would be in particular the following: - potentially no or limited court review and/or supervision of the restructuring proceedings; - any measures (such as reduction in principal and/or interest or deferrals) regulated by the restructuring plan may be approved within a class of creditors (e.g., the holders of the Notes) with a majority of 75% of the claims or by way of a so-called cross-class cram down by other classes under certain presumptions; - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to restructuring proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and - restrictions on individual enforcement actions for all or certain creditors regarding their claims, or, if applicable, their respective collateral over moveable assets of up to eight months due to a moratorium. _Restructuring proceedings_ Restructuring proceedings may only be initiated by the relevant debtor with a notification of the competent restructuring court of the commencement of restructuring proceedings. A debtor is eligible to file for restructuring proceedings if it has become imminently illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig). Such imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit) occurs if it is more likely than not that the debtor will be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall_ due within a two years’ look-forward period. During the restructuring proceedings, the debtor has to observe the duty of a prudent business manager, which includes safeguarding the best interest of all of the debtor’s creditors. In particular, the debtor has to refrain from any actions, which cannot be reconciled with or potentially frustrate the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel). This means that, generally, any claims, which shall be subject to the envisaged restructuring plan, must not be settled or collateralized during the restructuring proceedings. During the restructuring proceedings, the duty to file for insolvency without undue delay if the debtor becomes illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) or over-indebted (überschuldet) is generally suspended. However, if such an insolvency event occurs, the debtor is obliged to notify the restructuring court accordingly without undue delay. The restructuring court then abrogates the restructuring proceedings unless, in the restructuring courts discretion, (i) the abrogation of the restructuring proceedings is, against the backdrop of the advanced status of restructuring proceedings, evidently not in the interest of all creditors or (ii) the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over- indebtedness (Überschuldung) is caused by the enforcement of any such claim that is envisaged to be subject to the restructuring plan provided the achievement of the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) remains predominantly likely. Once restructuring proceedings have been abrogated by the restructuring court, the debtor is again obliged to file for insolvency under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). If (i) the envisaged restructuring also comprises of consumer claims or claims of small or medium enterprises or respective collateral granted for the benefit of such claims, (ii) the debtor has filed for a moratorium against all or essentially -306 ----- all creditors or (iii) the envisaged restructuring plan provides for specific supervision of the settlement of claims subject to the plan, the restructuring court has to appoint a mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter). A mandatory restructuring officer is also to be appointed by the restructuring court if the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) can predictably only be achieved by a cram-down of dissenting classes (unless only claims originated by financial institutions and/ or shareholders are to be compromised). The restructuring court may appoint as mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) any person with experience in restructurings and insolvencies who is suitable for the respective individual case and who is qualified as a tax advisor, accountant, lawyer or has comparable qualifications (an “Eligible Restructuring Officer”); the court may take suggestions by the debtor, creditors or shareholders into account. If (i) the debtor is, based on expert opinion provided by an Eligible Restructuring Officer, eligible for a moratorium (see “—Moratorium”), or (ii) creditors of one class with at least 25% of the corresponding votes in such class propose a mandatory restructuring officer, the court may only appoint a mandatory restructuring officer different from the proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer if the proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer is evidently inadequate. If a mandatory restructuring officer is appointed based on the proposal of the debtor or a group of creditors, the restructuring court may appoint an additional mandatory restructuring officer in its own discretion. The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) is entitled to decide on the procedure to be elected for the voting on the restructuring plan and can be empowered by the restructuring court to (i) supervise the debtor’s board and business situation and (ii) receive payments to and approve payments made by the debtor. If a moratorium is granted, the mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to monitor that the respective prerequisites of such moratorium persist and, in case such prerequisites do not persist, entitled to file for a lifting of such moratorium. Additionally, the mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to comment on the proposed plan’s prospects to remove the debtor’s imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and restore the debtor’s viability. The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has to perform its duties independently and the debtor is obliged to share all relevant information with the mandatory restructuring officer. The restructuring court can remove the mandatory restructuring officer from office for good cause ex officio or, if the mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has not acted independently, on the debtor’s or a creditor’s petition. Furthermore, the debtor or at least 25% of creditors in a voting class, can request the appointment of an optional restructuring officer to facilitate the development and negotiation of a restructuring plan. Creditors may only request such appointment if they agree to be jointly and severally liable for the costs of the optional restructuring officer. The optional restructuring officer is only obliged to support the stakeholders involved in the negotiations of the restructuring plan, but has no further powers. An optional restructuring officer can also be removed from office by the restructuring court ex officio for good cause or, if the optional restructuring officer has not acted independently, on the debtor’s or a creditor’s petition. Prior to a confirmation and implementation of a restructuring plan, the restructuring court may terminate the restructuring proceedings for certain reasons, e.g., if the debtor notifies the restructuring court of the occurrence of an insolvency event unless, in the restructuring court’s discretion (taking into account the actual status of the relevant restructuring proceedings), the opening of formal insolvency proceedings is obviously not in the interest of the entirety of the creditors or if the debtor files for insolvency or insolvency proceedings are opened over the assets of the debtor based on a creditor’s filing. _Restructuring plan_ Key element of the restructuring proceedings is the restructuring plan, which can comprise certain selected or all (with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and claims based on intentionally committed acts of tort) of the debtor’s liabilities, or amend the terms of financial and other agreements to which more than the debtor and one other party are parties, including the terms and liabilities relating to the relevant debtor under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Any form of financial or operational debt may be compromised, including contingent claims and undue claims, and relating contractual arrangements including syndicated credit facilities and intercreditor agreements can be amended by virtue of the plan. Corresponding collateral provided by debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten) may also be released and/or granted under a restructuring plan, provided that affected creditors are adequately compensated. Consequently, the Notes or the Note Guarantees could also be subject to a restructuring plan provided the respective debtor has its “centre of main interest” in Germany. Further, a restructuring plan may provide for a (partial) debt-to-equity swap or other corporate law measures like a share-capital increase. Debt-to-equity swaps can be implemented without the shareholders’ consent but require the willingness of at least certain creditors to equitize their debt claims as no creditor can be forced to take equity as a consideration under a restructuring plan. Hence, if, the Notes or the Note Guarantees were subject to a restructuring plan providing for debt-to-equity swap, single holders of the Notes could not be forced under the restructuring plan to take equity in the Issuer or a Guarantor without their respective consent. -307 ----- The restructuring plan will be voted on by creditors of the debtor and must subsequently be confirmed by the restructuring court. The vote may take place by way of consent solicitation process or in a (virtual) creditors’ meeting. Creditors will be divided into classes determined on the basis of the respective creditors’ economic interests in the debtor. As a minimum distinction, secured creditors, unsecured creditors, creditors that benefit from intra-group credit support and subordinated creditors (e.g., shareholders) will form separate classes. However, also other factors like, e.g., cross-holdings, could be taken into account for class composition. 75% by value of all claims of one class will be required to approve the plan for such class. There is no numerosity requirement. Dissenting classes can be crammed down (or up), if - the class members can be expected to be no worse off under the plan than absent the plan (whereby the alternative scenario must not necessarily be an in-court insolvent liquidation, but can also be an alternative out-of-court restructuring on a going concern basis); - the crammed down (or up) class members receive an adequate share in the economic value created by the plan; and - a majority of classes has accepted the plan. A crammed down (or up) class receives an adequate share in the economic value created by the plan if (i) no other creditor receives more than its claim’s par value, (ii) no creditors that would rank junior in insolvency proceedings, the debtor or its shareholders receive any value through the plan which is not covered by a respective stakeholder’s contribution to the plan and (iii) no creditor that would rank pari passu in insolvency proceedings receives a preferential treatment compared to the dissenting class under the restructuring plan (unless such preferential treatment is appropriate (sachgerecht) in light of the individual situation of distress to overcome and the dissenting class accounts for no more than 50% of the rank’s total claims). However, despite the prerequisite described under (ii) in the foregoing sentence, a creditor class can also be crammed down in case a shareholder retains equity without any additional contribution if the shareholder itself is crucial for and bindingly committed to the continuation of the debtor’s business and the realization of the restructuring plan or the creditors’ rights are only compromised marginally (e.g., by a maturity extension of no more than 18 months). Upon the debtor’s decision, either the debtor or the restructuring court can lead the voting on the plan. In case the voting has been led by the debtor, the restructuring court has to hold a hearing of affected stakeholders before the plan can be confirmed. The restructuring court will confirm the plan unless (i) the debtor is not (longer) imminently illiquid (drohend _zahlungsunfähig), (ii) there is a material breach of statutory provisions regarding the procedure to adopt the restructuring plan_ or its permitted content that cannot or has not been cured upon the restructuring court’s notice, (iii) claims contemplated by or surviving the restructuring plan can obviously be not satisfied by the debtor or (iv), if new money financing is contemplated under the restructuring plan, the underlying restructuring concept is incoherent or appears to be based on incorrect facts or to have no reasonable prospect of success. Additionally, dissenting creditors can request the restructuring court to reject the restructuring plan if the applicant will be expectedly worse off under the restructuring plan than without the proposed restructuring plan and the applicant has already raised such concern in the creditors’ meeting or creditors’ hearing, as applicable. However, such application has no merits if the restructuring plan provides for funds to be distributed to creditors that can prove to be worse-off, irrespective of whether any such applicant actually benefits from such funds. Dissenting creditors can appeal against the restructuring court’s confirmation order of the plan if they are able to produce prima facie evidence (glaubhaft machen) that they are worse-off under the restructuring plan and funds provided thereunder to compensate worse-off creditors (if any) will not suffice for their individual compensation. Such appeal will only have suspensive effect (aufschiebende Wirkung) against the effectiveness of the restructuring plan if requested by the dissenting creditor and ordered by the court based on serious and irreversible disadvantages for such dissenting creditor that are not in proportion to the benefits of an immediate implementation of the restructuring plan. Restructuring plans, which are negotiated and approved in public proceedings and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation upon the restructuring proceedings being included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation. This is expected to occur in July 2022. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law. As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1, 2021, any such recognition has not yet been tested as of the date of this offering memorandum. _Moratorium_ In order for the debtor to be able to draw up and negotiate the restructuring plan, the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) offers the possibility of having a moratorium ordered by the competent court upon application by the debtor, which can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors with regards to their payment claims or the realization of respective collateral over moveable assets. The moratorium can initially be ordered for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the moratorium up to a maximum of eight months permissible under certain conditions. Such moratorium may also be sanctioned with regards to collateral provided by the debtor’s affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten). -308 ----- The moratorium does not suspend the relevant creditor’s interest claims. However, whereas creditors may still file an insolvency petition against the debtor during a moratorium, correspondingly initiated insolvency proceedings are suspended for the time of the moratorium. Under certain conditions, in particular if the requirements to terminate restructuring proceedings are met or the debtor does not comply with certain statutory duties under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) the competent court may lift the moratorium, also on a creditor’s application.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

KG, such provisions apply to the general partner which is a GmbH. The granting or enforcement of guarantees or security interests by a GmbH or by a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures, certain credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and exemptions, to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a KG, its general partner that is a GmbH) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the Notes Guarantee, the Indenture and the Transaction Security Documents provided by the German Guarantors will contain such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees, the Indenture and the Collateral is limited in the manner described.

We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Guarantors to make payments on the Notes or the Notes Guarantees or the enforceability of the Notes Guarantees, the Indenture and the Transaction Security Documents relating to the Collateral provided by the German Guarantors. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (meaning, a situation in which a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a Guarantee or other collateral granted by the German Guarantors. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to nil. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Guarantee or any Collateral by the German Guarantors. The enforcement of security granted by a German Guarantor may also be excluded (entirely) in case the granting or enforcement of such security and/or the filing for insolvency as a consequence of a claim by any so secured finance party under such security resulted or would result in any personal liability of the relevant German Guarantor’s managing directors pursuant to Section 15(b) InsO. Furthermore, the beneficiary (for example, a holder of Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of a guarantee or security interest, as applicable, (for example, the provision or the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest) could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or provider of security interest is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the secured claim, will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claims is settled, discharged or novated, and may not be assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned. The holders of the Notes from time to time will not be party to the Transaction Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a Parallel Debt (as defined therein). Pursuant to the creation of the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent has its own separate and independent claim equal to each amount payable by each obligor under, in particular, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively secure the Parallel Debt rather than the obligations under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees or the holders of the Notes directly. The validity of the Parallel Debt concept and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such Parallel Debt has not been tested before German courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German law. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The Escrow Charge will be granted to the _Trustee and the security interests in the remaining Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent, in each case, rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_ German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. -313 ----- Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (meaning, the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors). In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. -314 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Accordingly, the Securities offered hereby are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and in offshore transactions outside of the United States (in each case, as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. We use the terms “offshore transaction” and the “United States” with the meanings given to them in Regulation S. Each purchaser of the Securities (other than the Initial Purchasers), by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to, warranted to and agreed with the Issuer, each Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers as follows: (1) The purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction and that the Securities are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and, in each case, in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below; (2) The purchaser is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Issuer or any Guarantor, is not acting on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor and is either: (a) a qualified institutional buyer, within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and is aware that any sale of these Securities to them will be made in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for their own account or for the account of another qualified institutional buyer; or (b) purchasing the Securities outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act and, if resident in a member state of the EEA or the United Kingdom, not an EEA Retail Investor or a UK Retail Investor (as applicable); (3) The purchaser acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing any of them, has made any representation to it with respect to us or the offer or sale of any of the Securities, other than the information contained in this offering memorandum, which offering memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Securities. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this offering memorandum.

If the purchaser purchases Securities, it will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to holders of beneficial interests in these Securities as well as to holders of these Securities.

If it is acquiring any Securities as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account; and (10) The purchaser understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Securities or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Securities in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Securities will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions.” (11) The purchaser acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of the Notes (including the Note Guarantees) is no longer accurate, it will promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If the purchaser is acquiring any Notes (including the Note Guarantees) as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, the purchaser represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account. (12) The purchaser represents, warrants and agrees that: (c) if such holder or beneficial owner is not a United States person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, (i) such holder or beneficial owner qualifies for an exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to payments of interest pursuant to an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party; or (ii)(x) such holder or beneficial owner does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the Issuer’s voting stock within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3) of the Code; (y) such holder or beneficial owner is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Issuer through actual or constructive stock ownership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and (z) such holder or beneficial owner is not a bank; (d) such holder or beneficial owner (and any intermediary through which such holder or beneficial owner holds the Notes) qualifies for an exemption from any taxes imposed under the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (which shall, for this purpose, refer to any taxes imposed under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (and any amended or successor version), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code, or any law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing); (e) such holder or beneficial owner is able to provide any required U.S. tax documentation to certify to the foregoing representations or to such holder’s or beneficial owner’s status as a United States person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code upon reasonable request by the Issuer or an applicable withholding agent; (f) such holder or beneficial owner agrees to give to each person to whom such holder or beneficial owner transfers the Notes notice of its requirement to meet the foregoing tax representations and documentation requirements.

79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.1,,25.1.1,,"The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes at the price specified on the cover of this offering memorandum. The sale of the Notes will be made pursuant to a purchase agreement among the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the date of the final offering memorandum (the “Purchase Agreement”). The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase the Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of them. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of this offering memorandum. Depending on market conditions, certain of the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the Notes for their own accounts. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the price at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates, including in respect of sales into the United States. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. Persons who purchase the Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out of pocket expenses. The Sponsor or its affiliates may place a purchase order for and be allocated the Notes at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum, subject to a pass through of the Initial Purchasers’ discount (ignoring any credit) in respect of the Notes purchased by such persons. Investment funds advised by entities affiliated with the Sponsor may purchase Notes in the Offering at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum, and in the case of investment funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), subject to the 1940 Act. The Purchase Agreement between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers will not restrict the ability of the funds and the affiliates of the Sponsor to buy or sell the Notes in the future and, as a result, these investment funds and affiliates of the Sponsor may buy or sell Notes in open market transactions at any time following the consummation of the Offering. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that, if an Initial Purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or, in some cases, the Offering may be terminated. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer and the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date falling 45 days after the closing of the Offering without the prior written consent of the representatives of the Initial Purchasers. The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and in offshore transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Notice to Certain Investors” and “Transfer _Restrictions.”_ Each Initial Purchaser has, severally and not jointly, represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor; and -318 ----- - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in this offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is ECPs and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to the Issuer’s obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in this offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the COBS, and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of UK MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the EEA or in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation and the UK Prospectus Regulation, respectively, from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation and the UK Prospectus Regulation. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Certain Investors” “Transfer Restrictions.” The Issuer has also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Issuer will apply, through their Listing Agent, for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange; however, the Issuer cannot assure you that such listing will be obtained or, if obtained, maintained. -319 ----- The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by law. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating the Notes—Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which _may adversely affect the value of the Notes.”_ In connection with the offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Transfer of _the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes.”_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 calendar days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 60 calendar days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6 1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be business days following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade such Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, are currently providing, or may in the future provide, investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking, various lending, hedging, cash management, guarantee or other banking or budgeting services to us and our affiliates under bilateral agreements or local facilities in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. In addition, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates will act as mandated lead arrangers and original lenders, as applicable, under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, which we will enter into as borrowers and draw to provide financing for the Acquisition. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also act as counterparties in hedging arrangements. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or certain of their respective affiliates advised the Sponsors on the Acquisition. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have provided a bridge facility that will be cancelled, including all commitments thereunder, on the Issue Date. In addition, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, an affiliate of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, will act as administrative agent and security agent under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or its affiliates are lenders under the Existing Credit Facilities Agreement which will be repaid and terminated on or around the Acquisition Closing Date. In connection with their services in such capacities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have received in the past, or will receive in the future, customary fees and commissions. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates, including the Notes. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to customers that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments. -320 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.1,Germany,23.1.1,,"We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore may depend on the laws of the relevant U.S. state and federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in section 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist: - if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment did not have jurisdiction; - if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense, provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly; - if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany; - if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible with a proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtshängig) before a German court before the U.S. federal or state court entered its judgment; - if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of German law, in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and - if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and enforce a comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances). Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the effect that reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets (vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts as incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being of a penal or punitive nature. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provided for -321 ----- pretrial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pretrial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such persons will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States. In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within Germany upon the German Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service violated the fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the action before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages. -322 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

January 1, 2019 The aforementioned changes will have no effect on the consolidated financial statements of the CeramTec TopCo Group, except for IFRS 16. IFRS 16 introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting treatments for both lessors and lessees. IFRS 16 supersedes the current lease guidance including IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations. IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer. Previous distinctions of operating leases and finance leases are removed for lessees and are replaced by a model where a right-of-use asset (or RoU asset) and a corresponding liability have to be recognized for all leases by lessees (i.e. all on balance sheet) except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets. At the commencement date, the amount of the right-of-use asset corresponds to the amount of the lease liability. In subsequent periods, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost (subject to certain exceptions) less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. At the commencement date, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are paid over the lease term. Subsequently, the carrying amount of the lease liability is adjusted for interest using the discount rate and reduced in the amount of the lease payments made. Modifications to the lease payments result in a remeasurement of the lease liability. Furthermore, the classification of cash flows will also be affected as operating lease payments under IAS 17 are presented as operating cash flows; whereas under the IFRS 16 model, the lease payments will be split into a principal and an interest portion which will be presented as financing and operating cash flows respectively.

Accordingly, the fair value measurement is allocated to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Liabilities to banks are subject to interest based on the interest rates observable on the market, such as EURIBOR or LIBOR, on the basis of which the fair value is calculated. Accordingly, these are allocated to level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the separated derivatives are measured using the Black-Scholes/Hull-White valuation model, which considers both the observable yield curves and the fluctuation intensity (volatility) of the currencies concerned. All key input parameters were directly or indirectly derived from observable market data. The fair value measurement is therefore allocated to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the interest rate cap is measured using the Black-Scholes/Hull-White valuation model, which considers both the observable yield curves and the fluctuation intensity (volatility) of the currencies concerned. All key input parameters were directly or indirectly derived from observable market data. The fair value measurement is therefore allocated to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. F-19 ----- The fair value of all other financial instruments is calculated using a discounted cash flow method as well as by taking into account measurement parameters that are observable for the assets and liabilities, either directly or indirectly, at the market. Accordingly, these financial instruments were allocated to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the shareholder loan (level 3) is determined by using the discounted cash flow method with risk free rate and the credit spread of CeramTec as inputs. For assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis, the CeramTec TopCo Group assesses whether a transfer between the levels of the fair value hierarchy took place as of the end of each reporting period (based on the lowest level that is significant to fair value measurement as a whole). There were no transfers between level 1 and 2 during the reporting period.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

The cash and cash equivalents presented in the statement of cash flows correspond to the item of the interim condensed statement of financial position and comprise cash in hand, bank balances and cash investments with an original term of up to three months. Other non-cash income and expenses primarily contain changes in the fair value of financial instruments and foreign exchange gains or losses. The cash flow from investing activities includes the purchase price payment for the shares of the Dentalpoint AG (please refer to 1.3). In September 2021 the final purchase price of EUR 49,908k was agreed. Cash and cash equivalents with an amount of EUR 948k were taken over resulting in a cash-out net of EUR 48,960k. Additions to property, plant and equipment in the reporting period amounted to EUR 2,058k that will affect cash during the following accounting period. During the period CeramTec TopCo Group paid EUR 5,164k for property, plant and equipment previously purchased on account, which was not included in the statement of cash flows in previous reporting periods as it was a non-cash transaction.

The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value. This is determined as the total of the acquisition-date fair values of the transferred assets, the liabilities assumed from the former owners of the acquired entity and the equity instruments issued by the acquirer in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the equity share in the acquiree previously held by the acquirer (if available) over the net of the acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the acquired net assets is higher than the consideration transferred, CeramTec TopCo reassesses and examines whether it has correctly identified all acquired assets and all assumed liabilities. In the event of a negative difference, even after reassessment, the resulting gain is recognized directly in profit or loss. For acquisitions of equity investments with shares in capital below 100%, IFRS 3 allows for the goodwill attributable to non-controlling interests to also be recognized. Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. This option can be newly exercised each time a business combination takes place. Other types of non-controlling interests are measured at fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in other standards. If a company which is part of the CeramTec TopCo Group acquires an entity, it measures the financial assets and liabilities for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date. This also includes separating embedded derivatives in host contracts of the acquiree. If the business combination is achieved in stages, previously held equity interests are remeasured at their acquisition-date fair value. Any gain or loss is recognized through profit or loss and is taken into account when determining goodwill. All contingent consideration that must be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value as of the date of acquisition. Any contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability, which is recognized as a financial instrument under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, is measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value are recognized through profit or loss. Should the contingent consideration not fall under IFRS 9, it is accounted for under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities _and Contingent Assets, as appropriate. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and its_ subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairments. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least once a year (in the fourth quarter) as well as when there are indications of impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination must, from the acquisition date, be allocated to each of the cash-generating units of CeramTec TopCo, which is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquirer are assigned to those units or groups. If goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. If the internal management reporting structure is reorganized, any goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is reallocated based on the new reporting structure. Any goodwill reallocated under these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the newly established operation and the portion of the cashgenerating unit. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value. This is determined as the total of the acquisition-date fair values of the transferred assets, the liabilities assumed from the former owners of the acquired entity and the equity instruments issued by the acquirer in exchange for control of the acquiree.

Furthermore, a consolidated tax group for VAT purposes is in place between CeramTec AcquiCo as the parent company and CeramTec GmbH, Cerasiv GmbH Innovatives Keramik-Engineering, CeramTec-ETEC GmbH and Emil Müller GmbH. Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted as of the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for all deductible and taxable temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the tax accounts and the IFRS consolidated statement of financial position. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in transactions that effect neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax assets also include tax refund claims that result from the expected utilization of existing unused losses or interest carryforwards in subsequent years and the recognition of which is ensured with reasonable assurance. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the temporary differences are likely to reverse, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted as of the reporting date of the relevant company. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which event the current and deferred taxes are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. There is a consolidated tax group for income tax purposes between CeramTec BondCo (as the parent), CeramTec AcquiCo, CeramTec Holding (beginning on August 1, 2018), CeramTec Group, CeramTec FinCo GmbH, CeramTec GmbH, Cerasiv GmbH Innovatives Keramik-Engineering, CeramTec-ETEC GmbH and Emil Müller GmbH. In the abridged financial year January 1, 2018 – July 31, 2018, CeramTec Holding GmbH was not included in the consolidated tax group relationship with CeramTec BondCo, and was hence liable to income tax.

The acquired assets and liabilities are measured at their acquisition-date fair value. Using the acquisition method requires certain estimates and judgments, particularly with regard to determining the fair value of the acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as well as the fair value of liabilities assumed. In addition, the expected useful lives of acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment need to be determined. This measurement is largely based on estimated future cash flows. Deviations between the actual cash flows and those determined when calculating the fair value can have a significant effect on the future net profit/loss for the period of the CeramTec TopCo Group.

Accordingly, receivables are reduced by appropriate specific allowances for amounts estimated to be irrecoverable (for example receivables from customers on whose assets insolvency proceedings have been initiated are written off in full to the extent that any collateral provided is not recoverable).

For reasons of immateriality, this does not apply to the non-controlling interests in CeramTec India Innovative Ceramic Engineering Pvt. Ltd., Panaji—Goa, India. Differences from the currency translation of assets and liabilities compared to the translation of December 31, 2019 as well as exchange differences between the income statement and the statement of financial position are recognized under other comprehensive income and retained in equity under accumulated other comprehensive income. These amounts recognized under other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement upon the partial or complete disposal of a subsidiary included in the consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency transactions in the local financial statements are translated at the spot rate at the date of the transaction. The exchange rates of significant currencies used for the currency translation to the euro are as follows: For financial assets for which no objective evidence of impairment was present upon their origination or purchase, the effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) excluding expected credit losses, through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount on initial recognition. For financial assets for which objective evidence of impairment was present upon their origination or purchase, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows, including expected credit losses. The amortized cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortized cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any loss allowance. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method for debt instruments measured at amortized cost or at FVTOCI. For financial assets for which objective evidence of impairment was present upon their origination or purchase, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset, except for financial assets for which objective evidence of impairment subsequently arose. For these latter financial assets, interest income is recognized by applying the effective interest rate to the net carrying amount of the financial asset at the beginning of the reporting period that follows the occurrence of objective evidence of impairment. If, in subsequent reporting periods, the credit risk of such a financial instrument improves so that there is no longer objective evidence of impairment, interest income is recognized again by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset at the beginning of the following reporting period. For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the Group recognizes interest income by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset from initial recognition. The interest rate calculation does not revert to the gross basis even if the credit risk of the financial asset subsequently improves so that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired. Interest income is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is included in the “Interest income and other finance income” line item. _Financial assets at FVTPL_ Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value gains or losses recognized in profit or loss to the extent they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on financial assets and is included in the “Interest income and other finance income” or “Interest expenses and other finance costs” line items respectively. _Impairment of financial assets_ The Group generally recognizes a loss allowance for expected losses on financial investments in debt instruments that are measured at amortized cost or at FVTOCI, finance lease receivables, trade receivables and contract assets. The amount of expected losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. The Group recognizes a loss allowance for all trade receivables in the amount of the expected losses based on debtor-specific factors and information about their current economic situations. When estimating this, reference is also made to actual credit loss experiences of debtors. Irrespective of the above approach, the Group considers a default to have occurred when a financial asset is more than 60 days/90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a financial asset is still unimpaired. For all other financial instruments, the Group recognizes a loss allowance in the amount of the expected losses over their lifetimes if the credit risk of the financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. If, however, the credit risk of the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to the expected 12-month loss. The Group directly writes off a financial asset and hence reduces the gross carrying amount when there is information indicating that the debtor is in significant financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery procedures. Any recoveries made are recognized in profit or loss. F-36 ----- In addition to using external sources of information, the measurement of expected credit losses is based on the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a default) and the exposure at default. The assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data adjusted by forward-looking information as described above. _Derecognition of financial assets_ Derecognition of financial assets is carried out by the Group only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to a third party. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognizes its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the financial asset and also recognizes a collateralized borrowing for the consideration received. On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortized cost, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. In addition, on derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument classified as at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the investments revaluation surplus is reclassified to profit or loss. In contrast, on derecognition of an investment in equity instruments which the Group has elected on initial recognition to measure at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the investments revaluation surplus is not reclassified to profit or loss, but is transferred to retained earnings. Designated financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value. Any gains or losses arising on changes in the fair value are recognized in profit or loss unless the financial liabilities are designated as hedging instruments as part of a hedging relationship. However, for financial liabilities that are designated as at FVTPL, the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is recognized in other comprehensive income, unless the recognition of the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. The remaining amount of change in the fair value of the liability is recognized in profit or loss. Changes in fair value attributable to a financial liability’s credit risk that are recognized in other comprehensive income are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss; instead, they are transferred to retained earnings upon derecognition of the financial liability. _Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost_ Financial liabilities that are not a contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination, held for trading, or voluntarily designated as at FVTPL, are financial liabilities subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of a financial liability on initial recognition. _Derecognition of financial liabilities_ Derecognition of financial liabilities is carried out by the Group when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, canceled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss. The principal market or the most advantageous market must be accessible for the CeramTec TopCo Group as of the reporting date. When calculating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account certain characteristics of the asset or the liability (such as condition and location of the asset or limitations of sale and use) if market participants would also take these characteristics into account when determining the price for the acquisition of the respective asset or transferring the liability as of the reporting date. Fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account the ability of a market participant to generate economic benefits through the best use of the asset or by selling it to another market participant that would find the best use for the asset. The amount of the provision recognized is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation as of the reporting date. The best estimate must take account of inherent risks and uncertainties. If a provision is measured on the basis of the estimated cash flow required to settle the obligation, these cash flows are discounted in cases where the effect of the time value of money is significant. If it can be assumed that portions of or the entire economic benefits required to settle the provision are reimbursable by an external third party, this claim is recognized as an asset if the reimbursement is virtually certain and the amount can be reliably determined. The amount recognized for the reimbursement should not exceed the amount of the provision. The current income taxes of the CeramTec TopCo Group therefore include, in addition to German corporate income tax and trade tax, the tax expense of the foreign corporations, which was calculated based on taxable income according to local tax law and the tax rate applicable in each case. The loss before income tax of EUR -146,327k (prior year: EUR -322,781k) is allocable to Germany and abroad as follows: The deferred tax assets and liabilities stem from the following: The growth rate of the perpetuity was assumed to be 1.00% (prior year: 1.00%). The weighted average cost of capital for the CGU Medical Products is 9.31% (prior year: 9.21%) before tax and 6.92% (prior year: 6.89%) after tax. The weighted average cost of capital for the CGU Industrial is 13.19% (prior year: 13.69%) before tax and 9.63% (prior year: 10.38%) after tax. Equity costs were calculated using a base interest rate of -0.10% (prior year: 0.17%) each and a market risk premium of 7.75% (prior year: 7.50%) each. Due mainly to the decline in revenue and earnings expectations caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the impairment test performed during the year as of June 30, 2020 for the CGU Industrial resulted in the need to recognize impairment losses totaling EUR 137,065k, as the carrying amount exceeded the assets’ value in use. Goodwill of the CGU Industrial has since been completely written down and accordingly has a carrying amount of EUR 0k as of December 31, 2020. The planning for the year 2021 is based on revenue of EUR 328,400k and an average moderate annual increase in revenues and EBITDA in the detail planning period. According to our assessment, reasonably possible changes in significant basic assumptions (weighted average cost of capital, EBITDA margin) underlying the determination of value in use would not result in an excess of the carrying amount of the CGU Medical Products and the CGU Industrial over its value in use. As of March 8, 2018, the CeramTec, BIOLOX, SPK and DAI Ceramics trademarks were identified within the scope of the purchase price allocation. The carrying amount of the above trademarks was EUR 53,544k as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: EUR 53,544k). As the recognized trademarks do not represent a product-specific trademark and do not have identifiable useful lives, the useful life for the recognized trademarks was classified as indefinite. Upon acquisition, the trademarks were allocated to the cash-generating units Medical Products (EUR 33,200k) and Industrial (EUR 25,800k). The impairment test with regard to the trademarks of the CGU Industrial did not result in any need to recognize impairment losses (prior year: EUR 5,456k). Technology has a carrying amount of EUR 283,852k (December 31, 2019: EUR 302,481k) and primarily contains the basic technology underlying high-performance ceramics. This has an average weighted remaining useful life of 15.2 years (December 31, 2019: 16.2 years). Customer relationships have a carrying amount of EUR 632,085k (December 31, 2019: EUR 677,789k) and primarily contain customer relationships from the Medical Products business. These have an average weighted remaining useful life of 14.1 years (December 31, 2019: 15.1 years). Scheduled amortization of other intangible assets is recognized under cost of sales, selling expenses, research and development costs and general administrative costs, while impairment losses are recognized under other income and expenses (-), net. F-49 ----- At the reporting date, the write-down of inventories amounts to EUR 15,994k (December 31, 2019: EUR 14,636k). The expense resulting from the increase of EUR 1,358k in the write-down is reported in cost of sales. There was no indication as of the reporting date that the debtors of receivables that were not impaired and not past due would not meet their payment obligations. On average, the Group has recognized loss allowances of around 40% in relation to all receivables past due more than 60 days. The following table shows the development of loss allowances on trade receivables during the past reporting period. Additional general risks of non-payment are considered remote. Furthermore, since the end of 2014, the Company has committed itself to directly providing benefits as compensation to employees who have been enrolled into Hoechster Pensionskasse, which was subject to the realignment of pension funds that might be to their disadvantage. The obligation is measured annually by an actuarial expert. The pension plan in the UK is a funded defined benefit plan. The plan is administered by an external sponsoring institution managed by employer and employee representatives. The representatives are legally obligated to represent the interests of the entitled employees and are responsible for the investment decisions and managing the assets. The pension plan is closed. The plan grants the entitled employees annual pension payments, the amount of which depends on the length of service and the last salary earned. Pension payments are also made in the event of death. The obligation is measured annually by an actuarial expert. The provisions for pension obligations break down as follows: The following table shows the extent of the obligation and the amount of plan assets as well as the provisions disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position for the comparable period as of December 31, 2019. The risk from changes in actuarial assumptions underlying the measurement of the defined pension plans is borne by the relevant group company. The sensitivity analyses presented in the table below were performed based on reasonably possible changes in the respective assumptions as of the reporting date. The change in key actuarial assumptions would have the following effects (in kEUR) on the present value of pension obligations: employees and employer made a fixed, income-based contribution. There is no obligation on the part of the employer to adjust current pension benefits. Surpluses are used to increase the pension benefits. Although the existing obligations are at present fully covered by assets in accordance with German accounting standards for pension funds, the additional capital requirements have not been satisfied. There is a plan approved by regulatory authorities in place to remedy the contravention of requirements. Negative budget variances, for example due to the pension fund earning an insufficient return on assets, may result in the CeramTec TopCo Group having to make additional payments. The proportion of members whose membership is based on an existing or former work contract with CeramTec GmbH, CeramTec Service or Emil Müller GmbH in the total number of pension fund members amounts to around 26% for active employees, around 11% for non-contributory employees and around 4% for pensioners. The pension fund Pensionskasse der Mitarbeiter der Hoechst-Gruppe VVaG is funded with income-based contributions by entitled employees as well as variable employer contributions. The employers’ contribution must, together with the employees’ member contributions and pension fund surpluses, sufficiently fund the agreed benefit payments according to actuarial principles. Once pension payments have begun, the pension fund assumes the statutory pension adjustments provided it has the sufficient means to do so. The proportion of members whose membership is based on an existing or former work contract with the CeramTec TopCo Group in the total number of members for active employees, non-contributory employees and pensioners ranges between around 0.1% and 0.15% in each case. As of December 1, 2014, company pension schemes underwent some realignment, and all employees whose membership was based on an existing contract with the pension fund Dynamit Nobel VVaG were enrolled into Hoechster Pensionskasse VVaG. Since January 1, 2015, contributions have not been paid anymore to the pension fund Dynamit Nobel VVaG, and the employees have become extraordinary members. All new hires become members of Hoechster Pensionskasse VVaG. The employees and employer make a fixed, income-based contribution to Hoechster Pensionskasse VVaG. There is no obligation on the part of the employer to adjust current pension benefits. Surpluses are used to increase the pension benefits. CeramTec GmbH has committed itself to directly providing benefits as compensation for the realignment which involved enrolling the employees into another pension fund, which may be to their disadvantage. The contributions made to the pension funds amounted to EUR 2,413k in the financial year (prior year: EUR 2,558k). The expenses are recorded in cost of sales, selling expenses, research and development costs as well as general administrative costs. Planned contributions of EUR 2,426k are expected to be made in 2021 (prior year: EUR 2,451k). The expenses for additional defined contribution plans related to the employer’s share of contributions to the German state pension insurance scheme, and amounted to EUR 11,827k (prior year: EUR 11,754k). The provision for taxes includes anticipated income tax payments for past assessment periods. Sundry provisions primarily comprise provisions for severance pay, legal and consulting fees as well as provisions for other contingent liabilities. The maturities of the provisions were as follows: Within liabilities to banks, the funds raised under the EUR tranche were increased by a nominal amount of EUR 175,000k effective as of December 15, 2020, resulting in a total volume of EUR 1,069,000k from the EUR tranche. Furthermore, there are two USD tranches with a nominal volume of EUR 121,326k. The tranches have variable interest rates and mature on March 8, 2025. Transaction costs of EUR 33,641k associated with the loan are spread over the term of the loan using the effective interest method. In 2019, voluntary repayments were made in relation to the syndicated loan of EUR 44,000k on the EUR tranche and EUR 9,872k on two USD tranches. The bond has a fixed interest rate and a nominal volume of EUR 406,000k (December 31, 2019: nominal volume of EUR 406,000k). It is due to mature on December 15, 2025. The CeramTec TopCo Group has a termination option for this bond, which is recognized as a separate financial asset (note 4.3). Associated transaction costs of EUR 13,570k are spread over the term of the bond using the effective interest method. Further information on the loans, the bond and derivatives can be found in note 4.15. Lease liabilities are composed of right-of-use assets capitalized in accordance with IFRS 16 (see note 4.14) in the amount of EUR 4,309k and finance leases recognized in previous years in accordance with IFRS 17 in the amount of EUR 1,086k. The right-of-use assets can be related to the asset category of property, plant and equipment as follows: - **Level 2: Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly - **Level 3: Level 3 inputs are unobservable measurement parameters for the asset or liability. The following table shows the fair value hierarchy for derivative financial instruments that are recognized at fair value in the consolidated financial statements: parameters were directly or indirectly derived from observable market data. The fair value measurement is therefore allocated to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of all other financial instruments is calculated using a discounted cash flow method as well as by taking into account measurement parameters that are observable for the assets and liabilities, either directly or indirectly, at the market. Accordingly, these financial instruments were allocated to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis, the CeramTec TopCo Group assesses whether a transfer between the levels of the fair value hierarchy took place as of the end of each reporting period (based on the lowest level that is significant to fair value measurement as a whole). There were no transfers between level 1 and 2 during the reporting period. In the financial year, liabilities arising from financing activities developed as follows: CeramTec TopCo group companies entered into agreements governing interest rate caps until May 31, 2022 and until May 31, 2024 respectively, in the form of two successive EUR interest rate caps in the amount of EUR 873,000k each, linked to 3-month EURIBOR, and two successive USD interest rate caps of USD 120,000k and USD 149,000k respectively, linked to 3-month LIBOR. The interest rate caps limit the maximum variable interest rates to 0.75% or 0.25% (EURIBOR) and to 2.75% or 1.25% (LIBOR). The following table shows the effects on the financial result assuming a hypothetical change of +/- 100 basis points to the variable USD and EUR interest rates. risk as far as possible by ensuring sufficient financing and credit lines from banks. In light of this, the CeramTec TopCo group companies had an undrawn and confirmed credit line of EUR 75,000k as of the reporting date consisting of a revolving credit line of EUR 67,000k and another short-term credit line for the overdraft facility of EUR 8,000k. Furthermore, the CeramTec group companies had cash and cash equivalents of EUR 244,118k. The table below shows the contractually agreed undiscounted cash flows for the financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments as of the reporting date. The following cash flows were taken into account: - Undiscounted, contractually agreed interest and principal payments from the loans in USD and EUR, including payments that are attributable to the separated interest rate floor. Cash flows in USD were translated into EUR based on the USD/EUR forward rate applicable as of the reporting date. Premature, voluntary special payments or repayments have not been taken into account. - Undiscounted, contractually agreed interest and principal payments for the bond. Premature, voluntary special payments or repayments have not been taken into account. - Undiscounted, contractually agreed payments for the interest rate cap. The termination option separated from the bond and recognized as other financial asset is not exposed to any credit risk as of the reporting date, because the positive market value is based solely on a potential premature repayment of the bond and an associated more favorable opportunity to refinance for the CeramTec TopCo Group, without giving rise to any actual cash receivable from the banks. _Trade receivables_ A loss allowance of EUR 495k was recognized for lifetime expected credit losses on trade receivables (in accordance with the simplified approach set out in IFRS 9). The net receivables portfolio amounts to EUR 51,880k after deducting the loss allowance from the gross receivables portfolio of EUR 52,375k. The gross receivables portfolio of receivables that are more than 30 days past due amounts to EUR 4,170k. The net receivables portfolio amounts to EUR 3,675k (level 3) after deducting the loss allowance of EUR 495k. The loss allowance the Group is required to recognize is not determined based on external credit ratings. The expected credit losses are estimated by reference to factors that are specific to a debtor and information about the debtor’s financial position. In addition, past default experience of the debtor is also taken into account in the assessment. It is allocated to level 3 of IFRS 9. Non-payment risks are not expected to be associated with all other financial assets, including separated termination rights or the amount retained by a factor as a security for any bad debts that may arise. As part of a participation program, selected employees of the CeramTec TopCo Group were offered the option to directly acquire shares in CeramTec Management Beteiligungs GmbH & Co. KG and CeramTec Co-Investment GmbH & Co. KG. As of the reporting date, selected employees hold overall less than 10% of the shares in CeramTec TopCo GmbH indirectly. These shares were acquired at the shares’ fair value at the grant date. The management participation program is intended to serve as an incentive instrument, motivating the management in view of growth and long-term business success of the CeramTec Group. For this purpose, the agreements define exit events (disposal, stock market flotation) upon the occurrence of which the entitled management will participate in any growth in value of the CeramTec Group in the same relation as the investors. In this case, depending on the respective exit event, the management has the right or the duty to sell their own shares. Given the case that the employment contract of an employee who holds shares in the Company is terminated before the occurrence of an exit event, this employee is obliged to offer his or her shares in CeramTec Management Beteiligungs GmbH & Co. KG for purchase to the Lead B.C. Investor or a third party determined by the Lead B.C. Investor. The amount of the purchase price for the management’s interest varies between the fair market value of the shares and the contribution made, depending on the reason and time of withdrawal. In accordance with IFRS 2, the granting of shares from the Participation and Shareholders’ Agreements is treated as settled by equity instruments. As, under the purchase, the managers pay the fair value of the shares, the fair value of the allocated shares, when settled by equity instruments, is zero. For this reason, provided that the assessment in respect of the occurrence of a payment obligation does not change, an expense does not, at any time, need to be disclosed (neither in the case of an exit nor upon withdrawal of a manager). Information about the remuneration of the management of CT TopCo according to Section 314 (1) No. 6 HGB is not provided. CeramTec GmbH has a supervisory board in accordance with the articles of incorporation. The total remuneration of the supervisory board in the financial year 2020 amounted to EUR 148k (prior year: EUR 162k). In accordance with IFRS 10, uniform accounting policies are used to prepare the separate financial statements of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany receivables and liabilities, revenue, income and expenses and any inter-company profits and losses within the scope of consolidation are eliminated. Pursuant to IAS 12, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences arising from consolidation procedures. If less than 100% of equity in a subsidiary is allocable to CeramTec TopCo, the interests allocated to the other shareholders are generally disclosed separately under equity as non-controlling interests. For reasons of immateriality, this does not apply to the non-controlling interests in CeramTec India Innovative Ceramic Engineering Pvt. Ltd., Panaji—Goa, India. Following initial recognition, property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairments. Property, plant and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight-line method. Property, plant and equipment acquired during the year are depreciated pro rata temporis. The useful lives of property, plant and equipment amount to 10 to 40 years for buildings and building components, 3 to 25 years for plant and machinery and 3 to 12 years for other equipment, furniture and fixtures. Low-value assets with an acquisition cost not exceeding EUR 250 are expensed immediately. Low-value assets with a cost of between EUR 250 and EUR 1,000 are recognized in a catch-all item and depreciated collectively over five years using the straight-line method. Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. Impairment is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and equipment with its recoverable amount at the level of the cash-generating unit. Property, plant and equipment are grouped at the lowest level for which the cash flows can be separately identified. The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is defined as the higher of the cashgenerating unit’s fair value less the cost to sell, or its value in use. An impairment is carried out if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. In the event of an impairment being reversed, the amortized cost is written up. All other financial assets that do not fulfill the aforementioned conditions are generally measured at FVTPL. The Group neither recognizes debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI nor equity instruments designated to be classified as FVTOCI. _Amortized cost and effective interest method_ The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. For financial assets for which no objective evidence of impairment was present upon their origination or purchase, the effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts), excluding expected credit losses, through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount on initial recognition. For financial assets for which objective evidence of impairment was already present upon their origination or purchase, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated based on the estimated future cash flows, including expected credit losses. The amortized cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortized cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any loss allowance. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method for debt instruments measured at amortized cost or at FVTOCI. For financial assets for which no objective evidence of impairment was present upon their origination or purchase, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset, except for financial assets for which objective evidence of impairment subsequently arose. For these latter financial assets, interest income is recognized by applying the original effective interest rate to the net carrying amount of the financial asset at the beginning of the reporting period that follows the occurrence of objective evidence of impairment. If, in subsequent reporting periods, the credit risk of such a financial instrument improves so that there is no longer objective evidence of impairment, interest income is recognized again by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset at the beginning of the following reporting period. For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the Group recognizes interest income by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset from initial recognition. The interest rate calculation does not revert to the gross basis even if the credit risk of the financial asset subsequently improves so that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired. Interest income is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is included in the “Interest income and other finance income” line item. _Financial assets at FVTPL_ Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value gains or losses recognized in profit or loss to the extent they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on financial assets and is included in the “Interest income and other finance income” or “Interest expenses and other finance expenses” line item. _Impairment of financial assets_ The Group generally recognizes a loss allowance for expected losses on financial investments in debt instruments that are measured at amortized cost or at FVTOCI, finance lease receivables, trade receivables and contract assets. The amount of expected losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. The Group recognizes a loss allowance for all trade receivables in the amount of the expected losses based on debtor-specific factors and information about their current economic situations. When estimating this, reference is also made to actual credit loss experiences of debtors. Irrespective of the above approach, the Group considers a default to have occurred when a financial asset is more than 60 days/90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a financial asset is still unimpaired. F-88 ----- For all other financial instruments, the Group recognizes a loss allowance in the amount of the expected losses over their lifetimes if the credit risk of the financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. If, however, the credit risk of the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to the expected 12-month loss. The Group directly writes off a financial asset and hence reduces the gross carrying amount when there is information indicating that the debtor is in significant financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery procedures. Any recoveries made are recognized in profit or loss. In addition to using external sources of information, the measurement of expected credit losses is based on the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a default) and the exposure at default. The assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data adjusted by forward-looking information as described above. _Derecognition of financial assets_ Derecognition of financial assets is carried out by the Group only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to a third party. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognizes its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the financial asset and also recognizes a collateralized borrowing for the consideration received. On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortized cost, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. In addition, on derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument classified as at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the investments revaluation surplus is reclassified to profit or loss. In contrast, on derecognition of an investment in equity instruments which the Group has elected on initial recognition to measure at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the investments revaluation surplus is not reclassified to profit or loss, but is transferred to retained earnings. - the financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or - it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IFRS 9 permits the entire combined contract to be designated as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value with any gains or losses arising on changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss to the extent that they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. However, for financial liabilities that are designated as at FVTPL, the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is recognized in other comprehensive income, unless the recognition of the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. The remaining amount of change in the fair value of the liability is recognized in profit or loss. Changes in fair value attributable to a financial liability’s credit risk that are recognized in other comprehensive income are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss; instead, they are transferred to retained earnings upon derecognition of the financial liability. _Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost_ Financial liabilities that are not contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination, held for trading, or voluntarily designated as at FVTPL, are financial liabilities subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of a financial liability on initial recognition. _Derecognition of financial liabilities_ Derecognition of financial liabilities is carried out by the Group when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, canceled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss. been determined by applying a valuation method. Measurement at fair value is based on the assumption that the transaction, in order to sell or transfer the asset or liability, is performed in one of the following places: - On the principal market for the asset or the liability or, - if there is no principal market, on the most advantageous market for the asset or the liability. The principal market or the most advantageous market must be accessible for the CeramTec TopCo Group as of the reporting date. When calculating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account certain characteristics of the asset or the liability (such as condition and location of the asset or limitations of sale and use) if market participants also would also take these characteristics into account when determining the price for the acquisition of the respective asset or transferring the liability as of the reporting date. Fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account the ability of a market participant to generate economic benefits through the best use of the asset or by selling it to another market participant that would find the best use for the asset. The fair value of the plan assets is deducted from the present value of the pension obligations. Plan assets are assets that are held by a long-term employee benefit fund. This fund must be legally separate from the reporting entity and exist solely to pay or fund employee benefits. GmbH until May 2018 inclusive. Since June 2018, there has been a consolidated tax group for VAT purposes between CeramTec AcquiCo as the new parent company and CeramTec GmbH, Cerasiv GmbH Innovatives Keramik-Engineering, CeramTec-ETEC GmbH and Emil Müller GmbH. In addition, until May 2018 inclusive, CeramTec AcquiCo was an independent entrepreneur as defined in the German Value Added Tax Act (UStG). Provisions for pension obligations of EUR 113,433k were recorded as of the end of the reporting period (December 31, 2018: EUR 100,200k). Furthermore, the disclosure requirements for lessees and lessors have become significantly more extensive in IFRS 16 when compared to IAS 17. The operating result takes account of depreciation of right-of-use assets, and interest expense associated with unwinding of discount on lease liabilities is included in the financial result. Overall, the CeramTec TopCo Group’s tax rate, based on the profit before tax and mainly driven by the German entities, is 28.7%, which will be used for the following reconciliation. The effective tax rate, i.e., tax expense in relation to profit before income tax, factors in both the current and the deferred tax expense and takes into account all influential factors, such as non-deductible operating expenses or a change in the assessment base. Other comprehensive income contains deferred tax income on the remeasurement of defined benefit plans of EUR 2,969k (prior year: deferred tax expense in the amount of EUR 116k), deferred tax expense from cashflow hedges in the amount of EUR 208k (prior year: EUR 0k) and deferred tax income on gain/loss arising on changes in the fair value of financial assets available for sale in the amount of EUR 95k (prior year: deferred tax expense in the amount of EUR 95k). surpluses. The measurement is therefore allocable to level 3 pursuant to IFRS 13. The projected future cash inflows are based on the approved financial budgets, which are undertaken by the CeramTec TopCo Group and, as a rule, have a three-year planning horizon. For this purpose, assumptions are made mainly about future selling prices, quantities and costs. The financial budgets are prepared on the basis of historical experience, and reflect the management’s expectations for the following years. More recent and better knowledge on the benchmark companies of the peer group resulted in the consideration of different benchmark companies for the CGU Medical Products and the CGU Industrial. The growth rate of the perpetuity was assumed to be 1.00% (prior year: 1.00%). The weighted capital cost rate for the CGU Medical Products is 9.21% (prior year: 11.75%) before tax and 6.89% (prior year: 8.70%) after tax. With regard to the CGU Industrial, the weighted capital cost rate before tax amounts to 13.69% (prior year: 11.33%) and 10.38% (prior year: 8.70%) after tax. Equity costs were calculated using a base interest rate of 0.17% (prior year: 1.25%) each and a market risk premium of 7.50% (prior year: 6.75%) each. With regard to the CGU Industrial, there was need to recognize impairment losses totaling EUR 329,753k as the carrying amount exceeded the assets’ value in use. The lower value in use in the amount of EUR 648,119k was mainly attributable to a more conservative revenue planning in consequence of a temporarily declined demand from the automotive and electronics industries given the slowdown in the macroeconomic development and a significant increase in the weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to the CGU Industrial after impairment amounts to EUR 137,065k. The planning assumes sales revenues of EUR 361,600k for 2020 and an average moderate annual increase in the detailed planning period. With regard to the CGU Industrial, an increase by 0.25 percentage points in the weighted capital cost rate after tax would result in need to recognize additional impairment losses of EUR 17,700k; a decrease in the EBITDA margin by 0.5 percentage points would result in valuation allowances to be recognized in the amount of EUR 13,800k. According to our assessment, reasonably possible changes in significant basic assumptions (weighted capital cost rate, EBITDA margin) underlying the determination of value in use would not result in an excess of the carrying amount of the CGU Medical Products over its value in use. As of March 8, 2018, the trademarks CeramTec, BIOLOX, SPK and DAI Ceramics were identified. The carrying amount of the above trademarks was EUR 53,544k as of December 31, 2019(December 31, 2018: EUR 59,000k). As the recognized trademarks do not represent a product-specific trademark and do not have identifiable useful lives, the useful life for the recognized trademarks was classified as indefinite. The trademarks were allocated to the cash-generating units Medical Products (EUR 33,200k) and Industrial (EUR 25,800k). The annual impairment text of the CGU Industrial’s trademarks resulted in need to recognize impairment losses of EUR 5,456k. Technology has a carrying amount of EUR 302,481k (December 31, 2018: EUR 320,211k) and primarily contains the basic technology underlying high-performance ceramics. This has an average weighted remaining useful life of 16.2 years (December 31, 2018: 17.2 years). Customer relationships have a carrying amount of EUR 677,789k (December 31, 2018: EUR 723,613k) and primarily contain customer relationships from the Medical Products business. These have an average weighted remaining useful life of 15.1 years (December 31, 2018: 16.1 years). Scheduled amortization of other intangible assets is recognized under cost of sales, selling costs, research and development costs and general administrative costs, while impairment losses are recognized under other income and expenses (-), net. F-101 ----- At the reporting date, the write-down of inventories amounts to EUR 14,636k (December 31, 2018: EUR 12,605k). The expense resulting from the increase in the write-down by EUR 2,031k is reported under cost of sales. The following table shows the development of loss allowances on trade receivables during the past reporting period. Additional general risks of non-payment are considered remote. a cap as well as benefits that are calculated based on the performance of the Company. The eligible employees are also entitled to deferred compensation which is subsidized by the relevant group company depending on the achievement of personal targets by employees. Furthermore, since the end of 2014, the Company has committed itself to directly providing benefits as compensation to all employees who have been enrolled into Hoechster Pensionskasse, which was subject to the realignment of pension funds, that might be to their disadvantage. The obligation is measured annually by an actuarial expert. The pension plan in the UK is a funded defined benefit plan. The plan is administered by an external sponsoring institution managed by employer and employee representatives. The representatives are legally obligated to represent the interests of the entitled employees and are responsible for the investment decisions and managing the assets. The pension plan is closed. The plan grants the entitled employees annual pension payments, the amount of which depends on the length of service and the last salary earned. Pension payments are also made in the event of death. The obligation is measured annually by an actuarial expert. The provisions for pension obligations break down as follows: The following table shows the extent of the obligation and the amount of plan assets as well as the provisions disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position for the comparable period as of December 31, 2018. The risk from changes in actuarial assumptions underlying the measurement of the defined pension plans is borne by the relevant group company. The sensitivity analyses presented in the table below were performed based on reasonably possible changes in the respective assumptions as of the reporting date. The change in key actuarial assumptions would have the following effects (in kEUR) on the present value of pension obligations: present fully covered by assets in accordance with German accounting standards for pension funds, the additional capital requirements have not been satisfied. There is a plan approved by regulatory authorities in place to remedy the contravention of requirements. Negative budget variances, for example due to the pension fund earning an insufficient return on assets, may result in the CeramTec TopCo Group having to make additional payments. The proportion of members whose membership is based on an existing or former work contract with CeramTec GmbH, CeramTec Service or Emil Müller GmbH in the total number of pension fund members amounts to around 26% for active employees, around 11% for non-contributory employees and around 4% for pensioners. The pension fund Pensionskasse der Mitarbeiter der Hoechst-Gruppe VVaG is funded with income-based contributions by entitled employees as well as variable employer contributions. The employers’ contribution must, together with the employees’ member contributions and pension fund surpluses, sufficiently fund the agreed benefit payments according to actuarial principles. Once pension payments have begun, the pension fund assumes the statutory pension adjustments provided it has the sufficient means to do so. The proportion of members whose membership is based on an existing or former work contract with the CeramTec TopCo Group in the total number of members for active employees, non-contributory employees and pensioners ranges between around 0.1% and 0.15% in each case. As of December 1, 2014, company pension schemes underwent some realignment, and all employees whose membership was based on an existing contract with the pension fund Dynamit Nobel VVaG were enrolled into Hoechster Pensionskasse VVaG. Since January 1, 2015, contributions have not been paid anymore to the pension fund Dynamit Nobel VVaG, and the employees have become extraordinary members. All new hires become members of Hoechster Pensionskasse VVaG. The employees and employer make a fixed, income-based contribution to Hoechster Pensionskasse VVaG. There is no obligation on the part of the employer to adjust current pension benefits. Surpluses are used to increase the pension benefits. CeramTec GmbH has committed itself to directly providing benefits as compensation for the realignment which involved enrolling the employees into another pension fund, which may be to their disadvantage. The contributions made to the pension funds amounted to EUR 2,558k in the financial year (prior year: EUR 2,139k). The expenses are recorded in cost of sales, selling costs, research and development costs as well as general administrative costs. Planned contributions of EUR 2,451k are expected to be made in 2020 (prior year: EUR 2,646k). The expenses for additional defined contribution plans consisting of the employer’s share of contributions to the German state pension insurance scheme amounted to EUR 11,754k (prior year: EUR 8,905k). Sundry provisions primarily comprise provisions for severance pay, legal and consulting fees as well as provisions for other contingent liabilities. The maturities of the provisions were as follows: On May 31, 2019 and August 29, 2019, voluntary repayments were made in relation to the syndicated loan of EUR 44,000k (prior year: EUR 32,000k) to the EUR tranche and EUR 9,872k (prior year: EUR 13,253k) to two USD tranches. The bond has a fixed interest rate and a nominal volume of EUR 406,000k (December 31, 2018: nominal volume of EUR 406,000k). In the financial year, the bonds with a nominal amount of EUR 5,000k which were acquired from a group company in the prior year were resold. This bond matures on December 15, 2025. The CeramTec TopCo Group has a termination option for this bond, which is recognized as a separate financial asset (note 4.3). Associated transaction costs of EUR 13,570k are spread over the term of the bond using the effective interest method. Further information on the loans, the bond and derivatives can be found in note 4.15. Lease liabilities are composed of right-of-use assets capitalized in accordance with IFRS 16 (see note 4.14) in the amount of EUR 4,216k and finance leases recognized in previous years in accordance with IAS 17 in the amount of EUR 1,210k. At the commencement date, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are paid over the lease term. Subsequently, the carrying amount of the lease liability is adjusted for interest using the discount rate and reduced in the amount of the lease payments made. Modifications to the lease payments result in a remeasurement of the lease liability. The following table shows the undiscounted cash flows for the lease liabilities existing as of the reporting date: The following table shows the fair value hierarchy for derivative financial instruments that are recognized at fair value in the consolidated financial statements: The fair value of all other financial instruments is calculated using a discounted cash flow method as well as by taking into account measurement parameters that are observable for the assets and liabilities, either directly or indirectly, at the market. Accordingly, these financial instruments were allocated to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis, the CeramTec TopCo Group assesses whether a transfer between the levels of the fair value hierarchy took place as of the end of each reporting period (based on the lowest level that is significant to fair value measurement as a whole). There were no transfers between level 1 and 2 during the reporting period. In the financial year, liabilities arising from financing activities developed as follows: into consideration, risks are identified, assessed and managed on an ongoing basis. In some cases, the CeramTec TopCo Group enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge certain financial risks. By contrast, it is not permitted to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The following table shows the effects on the financial result assuming a hypothetical change of+/- 100 basis points to the variable USD and EUR interest rates. - Undiscounted, contractually agreed interest and principal payments for the bond. Premature, voluntary special payments or repayments have not been taken into account. - Undiscounted, contractually agreed payments for the interest rate cap. The loss allowance the Group is required to recognize is not determined based on external credit ratings. The expected credit losses are estimated by reference to factors that are specific to a debtor and information about the debtor’s financial position. In addition, past default experience of the debtor is also taken into account in the assessment. It is allocated to level 3 of IFRS 9. Non-payment risks are not expected to be associated with all other financial assets, including separated termination rights or the amount retained by a factor as a security for any bad debts that may arise. of the purchase price for the management’s interest varies between the fair market value of the shares and the contribution made, depending on reason and time of withdrawal. In accordance with IFRS 2, the granting of shares from the Participation and Shareholders’ Agreements is treated as settled by equity instruments. As, under the purchase, the managers pay the fair value of the shares, the fair value of the allocated shares, when compensated by equity instruments, is zero. For this reason – provided that the assessment in respect of the occurrence of a payment obligation does not change – an expense does not need to be disclosed at any time (neither in the case of an exit nor upon withdrawal of a manager). Information about the remuneration of the management of CT TopCo according to Section 314 (1) No. 6 HGB is not provided. CeramTec GmbH has a supervisory board in accordance with the articles of incorporation. The total remuneration of the supervisory board in the financial year 2019 amounted to EUR 162k (prior year: EUR 139k). The total comprehensive income of CeramTec BondCo would therefore have been EUR 23k higher compared to the total comprehensive income recognized in these financial statements (prior year: EUR 364k). If the consolidated statement of financial position of CeramTec BondCo had been prepared instead of the consolidated statement of financial position of CeramTec TopCo, which is presented in these financial statements, this would have resulted in the following adjustments as of December 31, 2019: - Higher receivables from affiliates of EUR 261k (December 31, 2018: EUR 187k) - Lower liquid funds of EUR 10k (December 31, 2018: EUR 9k) - Lower capital reserve of EUR 25k (December 31, 2018: EUR 25k) - Lower financial liabilities to third parties of EUR 114k (December 31, 2018: EUR 164k). - This would have resulted in a EUR 365k higher level of group equity for CeramTec BondCo compared to the group equity recognized in these financial statements (December 31, 2018: EUR 342k). There would have been no impact on the consolidated statement of cash flows if the consolidated statement of cash flows of CeramTec BondCo had been prepared instead of the consolidated statement of cash flows presented in these financial statements.

In accordance with this five-step model, the contract with the customer is first identified (step 1). The performance obligations in the contract are then identified (step 2). The transaction price is then determined (step 3) with explicit requirements stipulated on how to account for variable consideration, financing components, payments made to a customer, and exchanges of goods or services. After determining the transaction price, the transaction price is allocated to each of the performance obligations in the contract (step 4), by reference to their relative standalone selling prices. Finally, revenue is recognized when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation (step 5). As a requirement, revenue can only be recognized once (or as) control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer. The Group does not offer guarantees to customers that provide greater protection than that stipulated by law. The Group does usually not grant customers extensions of payment terms. However, in specific cases, special agreements can be concluded. In addition, agreements are in place with individual customers (mainly Medical Products customers), which provide for a bonus/malus system. Revenue is only recognized to the extent to which it is highly probable that a significant cancellation of revenue will not be necessary if the related uncertainty has ceased to exist.

The real estate contained in plan assets relates to non-owner-occupied property in the UK. The investment horizon for plan assets takes into account the expected payout profile. From January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2014, all new hires at CeramTec GmbH, CeramTec Service and Emil Müller GmbH were members of the pension fund Dynamit Nobel VVaG. Furthermore, some active and former employees of CeramTec GmbH and Emil Müller GmbH are members of the pension fund Pensionskasse der Mitarbeiter der HoechstGruppe VVaG. These pension funds are multi-employer plans which are generally defined benefit plans. The two pension funds are subject to regulatory supervision. In the event that the funds are unable to settle their obligations, the employer is legally liable for the vested benefits (secondary liability). This obligation remains in place even if the CeramTec TopCo Group were to terminate its participation in the plans. However, terminating its participation would generally not directly result in having to make supplementary payments. In the consolidated financial statements, these pension plans are classified as defined contribution plans in accordance with IAS 19.34. As several employers are responsible for these pension funds, contributions made by the CeramTec TopCo Group can under certain circumstances be used to finance another entity’s employee benefits. Dynamit Nobel VVaG is funded for commitments made before December 1, 2007 with income-based contributions by the entitled employees as well as variable employer contributions. The employers’ contribution must, together with the member contributions and return on plan assets from the pension fund, sufficiently fund the agreed benefit payments according to actuarial principles. Once pension payments have begun, the pension fund assumes the statutory pension adjustments provided it has the sufficient means to do so. In the last few years, the pension adjustments could not be assumed by the pension fund and had to be funded by the employers.

Goodwill was allocated to the groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) Medical Products (EUR 874,613k), and Industrial (EUR 466,818k). The CGU Medical Products includes the business activities designed to develop, manufacture and supply technical high-performance ceramics products used for medical technology, and the CGU Industrial includes the business activities designed to develop, manufacture and supply technical high-performance ceramics products used in the electronics and automotive industries, and for mechanical engineering. For the cash-generating units, the impairment test was performed as of November 30, 2020. The recoverable amount was calculated based on the asset’s value in use. Value in use is calculated by discounting the future cash flow surpluses. The measurement is therefore allocable to level 3 pursuant to IFRS 13. The projected future cash inflows are based on the approved financial budgets, which are undertaken by the CeramTec TopCo Group and, as a rule, have a three-year planning horizon. For this purpose, assumptions are made in particular about future selling prices, quantities and costs. The financial budgets are prepared on the basis of historical experience, and reflect the management’s expectations for the following years. Different benchmark companies were considered for the peer group of the CGU Medical Products and the CGU Industrial. F-48 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Default risks in the majority of trade receivables (usually between 75% and 80%) of CeramTec GmbH, Plochingen/ Germany, the largest company that engages in operating activities, are covered by using credit insurance. After taking credit insurance into account, the maximum default risk on trade receivables of CeramTec TopCo Group comes to around 51% of the carrying amount as of the balance sheet date (December 31, 2019: 48%). Based on the CeramTec TopCo Group’s historical credit loss experience and customer structure, the Group is expected to sustain a small loss in the event of default, taking into account future-oriented macroeconomic information and existing insurance that protects the Group against loss on receivables.

These benefits are based, as a rule, on the length of service and level of remuneration or contributions of the eligible employees taking into account conditions in terms of tax, labor and welfare law in the respective country. In Germany, there are various direct commitments that depend on the remuneration and length of service and are subject to a cap. These commitments do not contain any rights to inflation-related pension adjustments. These defined benefit plans were closed for employees that joined after January 1, 2002. There is also a defined benefit plan in place with direct commitments for a fixed pension amount which depends on the employee’s length of service. This plan was also closed for employees that joined after January 1, 2002.

Accordingly, the fair value measurement is allocated to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Liabilities to banks are subject to interest based on the interest rates observable on the market, such as EURIBOR or LIBOR, on the basis of which the fair value was also calculated. Accordingly, these are allocated to level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the separated derivatives are measured using the Black-Scholes/Hull-White valuation model, which considers both the observable yield curves and the fluctuation intensity (volatility) of the currencies concerned. All key input parameters were directly or indirectly derived from observable market data. The fair value measurement is therefore allocated to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

At the CeramTec TopCo Group, the credit risk is primarily associated with trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and other receivables. Trade receivables exist in respect of numerous customers in various sectors and regions. Default risks related to customer receivables are locally monitored, assessed and limited by using credit insurance. After taking credit insurance into account, the maximum default risk on trade receivables amounts to 51% of the carrying amount. Cash and cash equivalents mainly comprise bank balances and cash in hand. In connection with the investment of cash and cash equivalents, the CeramTec TopCo group companies are exposed to losses from credit risks if counterparties do not meet their obligations. The resulting risk position is managed by diversifying the counterparties. For example, cash is only invested at banks with excellent credit ratings. There is no cash past due or impaired as of the reporting date. The maximum default risk for cash and cash equivalents corresponds to the carrying amount.

With this acquisition, the CeramTec Group invests in the sharply growing future market for ceramic dental implants and continues to expand the offering in the Medical Products segment. The preliminary purchase price of EUR 50,975k was paid using cash and cash equivalents. Deviations from the preliminary purchase price will arise due to the purchase price mechanisms agreed upon. Due to the proximity of the transaction to the date of approval of the annual financial statements, there are not yet any results of the currently ongoing purchase price determination and allocation in accordance with IFRS 3. For the purchase price allocation, which is generally based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the recognition of intangible assets such as technologies, customer relationships and brands as well as goodwill is expected.

If the consolidated statement of financial position of CeramTec BondCo had been prepared instead of the consolidated statement of financial position of CeramTec TopCo, which is presented in these financial statements, this would have resulted in the following adjustments as of December 31, 2020: - Higher receivables from affiliates of EUR 684k (December 31, 2019: EUR 261k) - Lower deferred tax assets of EUR 24k (December 31, 2019: EUR 0k) - Lower liquid funds of EUR 10k (December 31, 2019: EUR 10k) - Lower capital reserve of EUR 25k (December 31, 2019: EUR 25k) - Lower trade payables of EUR 35k (December 31, 2019: EUR 0k) - Lower tax liabilities of EUR 150k (December 31, 2019: EUR 0k) - Lower financial liabilities to third parties of EUR 91k (December 31, 2019: EUR 114k). - This would have resulted in a EUR 926k higher level of group equity for CeramTec BondCo compared to the group equity recognized in these financial statements (December 31, 2019: EUR 365k). The impact on the consolidated statement of cash flows would have been EUR -10k if the consolidated statement of cash flows of CeramTec BondCo had been prepared instead of the consolidated statement of cash flows presented in these financial statements.

79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,29,WHERE YOU CAN FIND OTHER INFORMATION,29.343,Independent Auditor’s Report,29.343.1,,"To CeramTec TopCo GmbH, Plochingen _Audit Opinions_ We have audited the consolidated financial statements of CeramTec TopCo GmbH, Plochingen, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2020, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2020, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of CeramTec TopCo GmbH for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2020. In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, - the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2020, and - the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Pursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report. _Basis for the Audit Opinions_ We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report” section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. _Responsibilities of the Executive Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report_ The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for dis- closing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated F-72 ----- financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report. _Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report_ Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and per- form audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures. - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions. - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides. - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information. F-73 ----- We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

The real estate contained in plan assets relates to non-owner-occupied property in the UK. The investment horizon for plan assets takes into account the expected payout profile. From January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2014, all new hires at CeramTec GmbH, CeramTec Service and Emil Müller GmbH joined the pension fund Dynamit Nobel VVaG. Furthermore, some active and former employees of CeramTec GmbH and Emil Müller GmbH are members of the pension fund Pensionskasse der Mitarbeiter der Hoechst-Gruppe VVaG. These pension funds are multi-employer plans which are generally defined benefit plans. The two pension funds are subject to regulatory supervision. In the event that the funds are unable to settle their obligations, the employer is legally liable for the vested benefits (secondary liability). This obligation remains in place even if the CeramTec TopCo Group were to terminate its participation in the plans. However, terminating its participation would generally not directly result in having to make supplementary payments. In the consolidated financial statements, these pension plans are classified as defined contribution plans in accordance with IAS 19.34. As several employers are responsible for these pension funds, contributions made by the CeramTec TopCo Group can under certain circumstances be used to finance another entity’s employee benefits. Dynamit Nobel VVaG is funded for commitments made before December 1, 2007 with income-based contributions by the entitled employees as well as variable employer contributions. The employers’ contribution must, together with the member contributions and return on plan assets from the pension fund, sufficiently fund the agreed benefit payments according to actuarial principles. Once pension payments have begun, the pension fund assumes the statutory pension adjustments provided it has the sufficient means to do so. In the last few years, the pension adjustments could not be assumed by the pension fund and had to be funded by the employers. For commitments given as from December 1, 2007, the employees and employer made a fixed, income-based contribution. There is no obligation on the part of the employer to adjust current pension benefits. Surpluses are used to increase the pension benefits.

The loss allowances mainly include specific loss allowances for receivables due from customers who have entered into bankruptcy proceedings or who are facing severe financial difficulties. Default risks in the majority of trade receivables (usually between 75% and 80%) of CeramTec GmbH, Plochingen/ Germany, the largest company that engages in operating activities, are covered by using credit insurance. After taking credit insurance into account, the maximum default risk on trade receivables of CeramTec TopCo Group comes to around 48% of the carrying amount as of the balance sheet date (December 31, 2018: 51%). Based on the CeramTec TopCo Group’s historical credit loss experience and customer structure, the Group is expected to sustain a small loss in the event of default, taking into account future-oriented macroeconomic information and existing insurance that protects the Group against loss on receivables. The resulting impairment loss on trade receivables is of minor importance. There was no indication as of the reporting date that the debtors of receivables that were not impaired and not past due would not meet their payment obligations. On average, the Group has recognized loss allowances of around 50% in relation to all receivables past due more than 60 days. F-104 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,475

Liabilities to banks are subject to interest based on the interest rates observable on the market, such as EURIBOR or LIBOR, on the basis of which the fair value is calculated. Accordingly, these are allocated to level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the separated derivatives are measured using the Black-Scholes/Hull-White valuation model, which considers both the observable yield curves and the fluctuation intensity (volatility) of the currencies concerned. All key input parameters were directly or indirectly derived from observable market data. The fair value measurement is therefore allocated to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the interest rate cap is measured using the Black-Scholes/Hull-White valuation model, which considers both the observable yield curves and the fluctuation intensity (volatility) of the currencies concerned. All key input parameters were directly or indirectly derived from observable market data. The fair value measurement is therefore allocated to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

The variable-interest rate loans in USD and EUR expose the CeramTec TopCo Group in particular to a cash flow risk arising from the change in the EURIBOR and LIBOR interest rates. By comparison, changes in variable interest rates relating to the fixed-interest rate bond may lead to a change in fair value. However, this risk does not impact the net profit/loss for the period or group equity, as the bond is carried at amortized cost and changes in fair value are not recognized.

We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. F-124 ----- Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.",N/A,as_expected,2022,475
79_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.4,Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report,103.4.1,,"Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures. - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions. - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides. - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the F-125 ----- significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
