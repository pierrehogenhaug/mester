## CPUK Finance Limited
(incorporated in Jersey with limited liability under registration number 108635)
£560,000,000 % Class B2 Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2042
BSREP II Center Parcs Jersey 2 Limited, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Jersey (in such capacity, the “Exchangeable Note Issuer”), is
offering £560,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % Exchangeable Notes due 2016 (the “Exchangeable Notes”). The Exchangeable Notes are being offered in
connection with the financing of the Acquisition (as defined below) and related transactions. On the date the Acquisition is consummated, the Exchangeable Notes will be
exchanged for £560,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % Class B2 Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2042 (the “Class B2 Notes”, and together with the Exchangeable
Notes, the “Offered Notes”) issued by CPUK Finance Limited (the “Issuer”) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Exchangeable Notes (the “Mandatory
**Exchange”). If the Mandatory Exchange does not occur on or prior to 30 November 2015 (the “Longstop Date”), the Exchangeable Notes will be subject to a special**
mandatory redemption and the Exchangeable Note Issuer will redeem all of the Exchangeable Notes on the Longstop Date at a special mandatory redemption price equal to
100% of the aggregate issue price of the Exchangeable Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the Exchangeable Note Issue Date (as defined below) to the date of
the special mandatory redemption. If the consummation of the Acquisition occurs on or prior to the Longstop Date, the Mandatory Exchange will occur and the Escrowed Funds
(as defined below) will be released from the Escrow Account (as defined below) subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
The Escrowed Funds released from the Escrow Account will be used in part to finance the proposed acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of CP MGMT Limited and CP
Cayman Midco 1 Limited (the “Target Companies”) and certain shares in the capital of Topco (as defined herein) by BSREP II Center Parcs Jersey 2 Limited (“Bidco”) and
ultimately to refinance the existing £280,000,000 11.625% Class B Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2042 (the “Original Class B Notes”), and, in each case, for the payment of
fees, costs and expenses related thereto.
Interest on the Exchangeable Notes will accrue at a rate of % per annum (the “Exchangeable Note Interest Rate”) from (and including) the issue date of the
Exchangeable Notes (the “Exchangeable Note Issue Date”) to (but excluding) 28 February 2016 (the “Exchangeable Note Final Maturity Date”). Interest on the
Exchangeable Notes will not be paid if the Mandatory Exchange occurs on or prior to the Longstop Date. Interest on the Class B2 Notes will accrue at a rate of % per
annum (the “Class B2 Note Interest Rate”) from (and including) the Exchangeable Note Issue Date to (but excluding) 2020 (“Class B2 Note Step-Down Date”) and
thereafter will accrue at a reduced rate of % per annum. Interest on the Class B2 Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on 28 February and 28 August (subject to
adjustment as specified herein for non-Business Days) (each, a “Note Interest Payment Date”) in each year commencing on 28 February 2016. The Issuer’s obligations to pay
principal and interest on the Class B2 Notes are intended to be met from the payments by the Borrowers of principal and interest in the corresponding periods on the
£560,000,000 Class B2 Loan (as defined herein) granted by the Issuer to the Borrowers on the Third Closing Date pursuant to the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement (each as defined herein). If on any Note Interest Payment Date, the amount received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B2 Loan is not
sufficient to pay the interest accrued on the Class B2 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period in full, the amount of interest accrued up to any such Note
Interest Payment Date that is not paid by the Issuer on such Note Interest Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest, being a “Deferred Interest
**Amount”) and such Deferred Interest Amount shall continue to accrue interest at the then applicable Class B2 Note Interest Rate until it is paid by the Issuer in full. Interest**
paid on the Class B2 Loans will be payable in cash on each Loan Interest Payment Date (as defined herein) to (but not including) 2020 (the “Class B2 Loan Expected
**Maturity Date”) and thereafter accruing interest shall be deferred.**
Pending consummation of the Acquisition, the gross proceeds from the offering of the Exchangeable Notes (the “Escrowed Funds”) will be deposited into an
escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”), dated as of the Exchangeable Note Issue Date, among,
_inter alios, the Exchangeable Note Issuer and HSBC Bank plc as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”). The Exchangeable Notes will be senior obligations of the Exchangeable_
Note Issuer and secured on a first-ranking basis by a pledge over the Escrow Account. The Exchangeable Notes will be the obligations of the Exchangeable Note Issuer only.
See “Terms and Conditions of the Exchangeable Notes” included in Annex A hereto for the full terms and conditions of the Exchangeable Notes and the Mandatory Exchange.
The Class B2 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full on 2020 (the “Class B2 Expected Maturity Date”). The Class B2 Notes will be subject to
mandatory redemption and/or may be subject to optional redemption before such dates in certain circumstances, including if and to the extent the Borrowers make principal
repayments or prepayments to the Issuer in respect of the Class B2 Loan. See “Terms and Conditions of the Class B2 Notes — Condition 5 (Redemption, Purchase and
_Cancellation)”._
The Borrowers may prepay the Class B2 Loan in whole or in part at any time on or after 2017 at the prepayment prices specified herein. Prior to 2017,
the Borrowers may prepay the Class B2 Loan in whole or in part at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and
additional amounts, if any, up to the prepayment date plus the applicable “make-whole” premium, as described herein. In addition, prior to 2017, the Borrowers may use the
net proceeds of specified equity offerings to prepay up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Class B2 Loan at a prepayment price equal to % of the principal
amount of the Class B2 Loan prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts, if any, up to the prepayment date, provided that at least 60% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the Class B2 Loan remains outstanding following the prepayment. Additionally, the Borrowers may prepay all, but not less than all, of the Class B2
Loan at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, up to the prepayment date upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon certain events constituting a change of
control, the Borrower may be required to make an offer to repurchase all the Class B2 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, up to the purchase date. In the event of any
prepayment by the Borrowers of the Class B2 Loan, in whole or in part, the Issuer will be required to apply the proceeds received from such prepayment to redeem a corresponding
principal amount of Class B2 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts,
if any, at a redemption price corresponding to the applicable prepayment price set forth in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.
The Class B2 Notes rank pari passu with the Original Class B Notes which will be refinanced with the proceeds of the Exchangeable Notes. The Class B2 Notes
will be contractually subordinated to, among others, the Class A Notes (as defined herein) and will not be guaranteed by any person, except that the Class B2 Notes will benefit
indirectly from the Topco Payment Undertaking (as defined below). The Class B2 Loan will be contractually subordinated to, among others, the Class A Loans (as defined
herein), the Liquidity Facility (as defined herein) and certain hedging arrangements, as described further herein. The Class B2 Loan will be guaranteed by the Borrowers and
certain subsidiaries of CP Cayman Midco 2 Limited (“Topco”), as further described herein. Pursuant to a deed of undertaking to be entered into on the Third Closing Date (the
“Topco Payment Undertaking”), Topco has undertaken to procure payment of all principal, interest and other amounts outstanding under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement in the circumstances described herein, including in the event that the Class B2 Loan is not repaid in full on the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date.
The Class B2 Notes will be secured by substantially all the Issuer’s property and assets (including its rights against each Obligor under the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement), which security will also be shared with, among others, the Class A Notes. The Class B2 Notes will rank junior to the Class A Notes with respect to the
application of enforcement proceeds, other than in respect of the Topco Security. The Class B2 Loan will rank junior to the foregoing with respect to the application of
enforcement proceeds, other than in respect of the Topco Security (as defined herein). The Topco Payment Undertaking will be secured by first-ranking security in respect of all
the issued and outstanding shares of CP Cayman Limited and of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited, as further described herein. The Topco Security will be granted for the sole
benefit of holders of the Class B Notes.
This Offering Circular constitutes the listing particulars in respect of the admission of the Class B2 Notes to the Official List (the “Official List”) of the Irish Stock
Exchange plc (the “Irish Stock Exchange”) and to trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange (the “Global Exchange Market”). Application has been
made to the Irish Stock Exchange for the Class B2 Notes to be admitted to the Official List and trading on the Global Exchange Market. The Global Exchange Market is not a
regulated market for the purposes of Directive 2004/39/EC. No assurance can be given that the application will be granted. Furthermore, admission of the Class B2 Notes to the
Official List and trading on the Global Exchange Market is not an indication of the merits of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Class B2 Notes. There can be no assurance that a
trading market in the Class B2 Notes will develop or be maintained. Arthur Cox Listing Services Limited is acting solely in its capacity as listing agent for the Issuer in relation to
the Class B2 Notes and is not itself seeking admission of the Class B2 Notes to the Official List or to trading on the Global Exchange Market.
The issue price of the Exchangeable Notes is %

Exchangeable Note Issuer’s knowledge and belief (having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case) the
information in the relevant sections is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the accuracy of
such information.

This Offering Circular relates to the offering of the Exchangeable Notes. On or about the completion date of the
Acquisition, the Exchangeable Notes will automatically be exchanged for Class B2 Notes. At that date, the holders of the
Exchangeable Notes will therefore automatically become holders of the Class B2 Notes. References to purchases of, of
investments in, the Exchangeable Notes should be read in this context. See “Terms and Conditions of the Exchangeable
_Notes” included in Annex A hereto for the full terms and conditions of the Exchangeable Notes and the Mandatory Exchange._

This Offering Circular does not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to subscribe for or purchase any of the
Offered Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is unlawful to
make such an offer or invitation. You must comply with all laws that apply to you in any place in which you buy, offer or sell
any Offered Notes or possess this Offering Circular. You must also obtain any consents or approvals that you need in order to
purchase any Offered Notes. We, the Issuer, the Exchangeable Note Issuer and the Joint Bookrunners are not responsible for
your compliance with these legal requirements.

Neither the Exchangeable Notes nor the Class B2 Notes have been approved or disapproved by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), any state securities commission in the United States or any other U.S. regulatory
authority, nor have any of these authorities passed upon or endorsed the merits of investing in the Offered Notes or the
accuracy or adequacy of this Offering Circular. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense in the United States.

The Exchangeable Notes are, and the Class B2 Notes will be, subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and
may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws pursuant to
registration thereunder or exemption therefrom. See “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions”. You should be aware that
you may be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time.

The Exchangeable Note Issuer is of the opinion that the requirements of Article 405 of the European Union Capital
Requirements Regulation (“Article 405”) do not apply to the Class B2 Notes.

On issue, it is expected that the Class B2 Notes will be assigned the respective ratings of Standard & Poor’s Credit
Market Services Europe Limited (“S&P”) and Fitch Ratings Ltd. (“Fitch” and, together with S&P, the “Rating Agencies”
and each, a “Rating Agency”). As of the date of this Offering Circular, both Rating Agencies are established in the European

ii


-----

Union and are registered under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 (the “CRA Regulation”). As such, each Rating Agency is
included in the list of credit rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority on its website in
accordance with the CRA Regulation. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be
subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organisation. A suspension, reduction or
withdrawal of any rating may adversely affect the market price of such securities.

A copy of this Offering Circular has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies in Jersey in accordance with
Article 5 of the Companies (General Provisions) (Jersey) Order 2002 and he has given, and has not withdrawn, his consent to
its circulation.

The Jersey Financial Services Commission has given, and has not withdrawn, or will have given prior to the
issuance of the Exchangeable Notes and the Class B2 Notes and not withdrawn, its consent under Article 4 of the Control of
Borrowing (Jersey) Order 1958 to the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes and the Class B2 Notes.

It must be distinctly understood that, in giving these consents, neither the Registrar of Companies in Jersey nor the
Jersey Financial Services Commission takes any responsibility for the financial soundness of the Exchangeable Note Issuer or
the Issuer or for the correctness of any statements made, or opinion expressed, with regard to it.

The Jersey Financial Services Commission is protected by the Control of Borrowing (Jersey) Law 1947, as
amended, against liability arising from the discharge of its functions under that law.

It should be remembered that the price of securities and the income from them can go down as well as up.

If you are in any doubt about the contents of this Offering Circular you should consult your stockbroker, bank
manager, solicitor, accountant or other financial adviser.

In connection with the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (the “Stabilisation
**Manager”) or any person acting on its behalf may, to the extent permitted by all applicable laws, regulations, rules and**
directives, over-allot and effect transactions in any over-the-counter market or otherwise in connection with the distribution of
the Offered Notes with a view to supporting the market price of the Offered Notes at a level higher than that which might
otherwise prevail. However, there is no assurance that the Stabilisation Manager (or any agent of the Stabilisation Manager)
will undertake any stabilisation action. Any stabilisation action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public
disclosure of the terms of the offer of the Offered Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no
later than the earlier of 30 days after the issuance of the Offered Notes and 60 days after the date of allotment of the Offered
Notes and must be brought to an end after a limited period in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and rules.

This Offering Circular does not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to subscribe for or purchase any of the
Offered Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is unlawful to
make such an offer or invitation. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this Offering Circular and the
offer and sale of the Offered Notes. Persons into whose possession this Offering Circular or any of the Offered Notes are
delivered must inform themselves about and observe those restrictions. Each prospective purchaser of the Offered Notes must
comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers or sells the Offered
Notes or possesses or distributes this Offering Circular. In addition, each prospective purchaser must obtain any consent,
approval or permission required under the regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it
purchases, offers or sells the Offered Notes. We, the Issuer, the Exchangeable Note Issuer and the Joint Bookrunners shall not
have any responsibility for obtaining such consent, approval or permission.

The information contained under “Exchange Rate Information” includes extracts from information and data publicly
released by official and other sources. While the Exchangeable Note Issuer accepts responsibility for accurately summarizing
the information concerning exchange rate information, the Exchangeable Note Issuer accepts no further responsibility in
respect of such information.

**Notice to Investors in the European Economic Area**

This Offering Circular has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Offered Notes will be made pursuant to
an exemption under the Prospectus Directive, as amended, as implemented in member states of the European Economic Area
(“EEA”), from the requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the Offered Notes. Accordingly, any person making or
intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Offered Notes which are subject of the offering contemplated in this
Offering Circular must only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer, the Exchangeable Note Issuer,
the Obligors or any of the Joint Bookrunners to produce a prospectus for such offer. None of the Issuer, the Exchangeable
Note Issuer, the Obligors nor any of the Joint Bookrunners has authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of
the Offered Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Joint Bookrunners which constitute the
final placement of the Offered Notes contemplated in this Offering Circular. The expression “Prospectus Directive” means
Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 (as amended, including by
Directive 2010/73/EU), and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Relevant Member State (as defined below).

In relation to each Member State of the EEA which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a “Relevant
**Member State”), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant**
Member State (the “Relevant Implementation Date”), no offer has been made and no offer will be made of the Offered
Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State prior to the publication of a prospectus in relation to the Offered Notes that
has been approved by the competent authority in that Relevant Member State or, where appropriate, approved in another
Relevant Member State and notified to the competent authority in that Relevant Member State, all in accordance with the
Prospectus Directive, except that, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, an offer of the Offered
Notes may be made to the public in that Relevant Member State at any time to:

(a) “qualified investors” as defined in the Prospectus Directive;

(b) fewer than 150, natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus
Directive) in any Relevant Member State subject to obtaining the prior consent of the Issuers; or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive, provided that no such
offer of the Offered Notes shall result in a requirement for the publication by the Issuers of a prospectus
pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression “offer of the Offered Notes to the public” in relation to any
Offered Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and the Offered Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or
subscribe for the Offered Notes, as such expression may be varied in the Relevant Member State by any measure
implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Offered Notes in the offering located within a Relevant Member State will
be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a “qualified investor” within the meaning of Article 2(1)(e)
of the Prospectus Directive. The Issuer, the Exchangeable Note Issuer, the Guarantors, our legal advisors and others will rely
upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement.

(the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology,
including the terms “believes”, “estimates”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “may”, “will” or “should” or, in each
case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that
are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Offering Circular and include statements regarding
the intentions, beliefs or current expectations of the Center Parcs Group concerning, among other things, the results of
operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies of the Center Parcs Group and the industry in which the
Center Parcs Group operates.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend
on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. The Center Parcs Group believes that these risks and uncertainties

operate, may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements set out in this Offering
Circular. In addition, even if the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Center Parcs Group, and the
development of the industry in which the Center Parcs Group operates, are consistent with the forward-looking statements set
out in this Offering Circular, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent
periods. Many factors could cause the Center Parcs Group’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements including, but not limited to:

      - failure to manage villages effectively or any significant business interruption;

Any forward-looking statements which are made in this Offering Circular speak only as of the date of such
statements. None of the Exchangeable Note Issuer, the Issuer and the Center Parcs Group intend or undertake any obligation,
to revise the forward-looking statements included in this Offering Circular to reflect any future events or circumstances.
Actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed under “Risk Factors” in

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**Historical Financial Information**

The financial information presented and discussed in this Offering Circular has been derived from the following
financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Circular:

      - The audited consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited as at and for each of the
52-week periods ended 23 April 2015, 24 April 2014 and 25 April 2013, in each case prepared in accordance
with IFRS; and

      - The audited financial statements of CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited (“CP Woburn Opco”) as at
and for each of the 52-week periods ended 23 April 2015, 24 April 2014 and 25 April 2013, in each case
prepared in accordance with IFRS.

Cost of sales and administrative expenses for the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2014 have been restated in the audited
consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2015 in order to more accurately reflect the nature of
expenses incurred by Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited. For the 52-week period ended 24 April 2014, costs of £53.0 million
have been transferred from Administrative expense to Cost of sales, principally in respect of payroll costs. In addition, Cost of
sales and Administrative expenses for the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2013 have been restated throughout this Offering Circular
from the audited consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited for the same period in order to
present the financial information on a consistent basis across the historical financial periods. These restatements have no
impact on Adjusted EBITDA or Operating profit.

**Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information**

As of 23 April 2015, Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and CP Woburn Opco did not constitute a combined group.
Accordingly, consolidated financial statements have not been prepared for Center Parcs as a consolidated group. This
Offering Circular includes unaudited pro forma combined financial information of Center Parcs as at and for the 52-week
period ended 23 April 2015 (the “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information”) because Center Parcs believes
that such information is important to an investor’s understanding of its combined results of operations.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the Woburn
Acquisition and Accession as well as to illustrate the effect of the Class A Notes Refinancing on the income statement and
balance sheet of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited on the basis set forth in the notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Financial Information in “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information”. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Financial Information does not reflect the impact of the Acquisition or the Financing Transactions on the trading or financial
position of either Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited or CP Woburn Opco for the period presented. The Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Information is presented for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered a presentation of the
actual results of operations that would have been attained had Center Parcs operated as a combined group during the periods
presented and had consolidated financial statements been prepared in accordance with IFRS for those periods.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information should be read in conjunction with the information
presented in “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information”, “Selected Consolidated Financial Information”,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the audited Center Parcs
(Holdings 1) Limited consolidated financial statements and the audited CP Woburn Opco financial statements and notes
thereto included elsewhere in this Offering Circular.

**Unaudited “as adjusted” financial information**

This Offering Circular includes unaudited pro forma combined financial information as adjusted to reflect the
impact of the Financing Transactions as at and for the 52-week period ended 23 April 2015. The “as adjusted” financial data
has been included to illustrate the effect of the Financing Transactions on the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet of
Center Parcs as if the Financing Transactions had occurred on 23 April 2015, and to illustrate the effect of the Financing
Transactions on the unaudited pro forma combined income statement of the Center Parcs as if the Financing Transactions had
occurred on 25 April 2014. The “as adjusted” financial data does not reflect the impact of the Acquisition on the trading or
financial position of the Center Parcs.

The “as adjusted” financial data is presented for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered a
presentation of the actual results of operations that would have been attained had Center Parcs operated as a combined group
during the periods presented and had the Financing Transactions actually occurred at an earlier period.

x


-----

The “as adjusted” financial data should be read in conjunction with the information presented in “Unaudited Pro
_Forma Combined Financial Information”, “Capitalisation” and the audited Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited consolidated_
financial statements and the audited CP Woburn Opco financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this
Offering Circular.

**Reporting Terms**

The financial year of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and CP Woburn Opco is divided into 13 four-week periods
to enable more meaningful conclusions to be drawn when periods are compared as all accounting periods contain the same
number of days and an equal number of weekend and mid-week breaks. For existing quarterly reporting purposes, Center
Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited reports at the end of periods three, six, nine and thirteen. This reporting corresponds to three
periods of 12 weeks and one period of 16 weeks in each financial year.

References in this Offering Circular to:

      - “Financial year 2015” or the “2015 financial year” are to the 52-week period ended 23 April 2015;

      - “Financial year 2014” or the “2014 financial year” are to the 52-week period ended 24 April 2014; and

      - “Financial year 2013” or the “2013 financial year” are to the 52-week period ended 25 April 2013.

**_Non-IFRS Financial Measures_**

_EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualised Adjusted EBITDA_

This Offering Circular contains certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,
Annualised Adjusted EBITDA and leverage and coverage ratios. These measures are not measures of Center Parcs’ financial
performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to (a) operating profit or profit/(loss) for
the period as a measure of operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a
measure of Center Parcs’ ability to meet their cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance under IFRS.

Center Parcs believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualised Adjusted EBITDA are useful indicators of
Center Parcs’ ability to incur and service its indebtedness and may assist investors, security analysts and other interested
parties in evaluating Center Parcs’ financial performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as the primary profit measure
to assess the performance of the operating segments and discloses it within the consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this Offering Circular. As all companies do not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or Annualised Adjusted
EBITDA on a consistent basis, Center Parcs’ presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualised Adjusted EBITDA
may not be comparable to measures under the same or similar names used by other companies. Accordingly, undue reliance
should not be placed on EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or Annualised Adjusted EBITDA in this Offering Circular. EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA and Annualised Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and investors should not consider
them in isolation. Some of these limitations are that:

      - they do not reflect Center Parcs’ cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments;

      - they do not reflect the changes in, or cash requirements for, Center Parcs’ working capital needs;

      - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments
on Center Parcs’ debt;

      - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that Center Parcs may be required to pay;

      - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in Center Parcs’ combined
income statement;

      - in the case of Adjusted EBITDA (but not EBITDA), it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges
resulting from certain matters Center Parcs consider not to be indicative of its on-going operations;

      - assets are depreciated or amortised over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the
future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

      - other companies in Center Parcs’ industry may calculate these measures differently from the manner Center
Parcs does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

In this Offering Circular, except where otherwise indicated, Adjusted EBITDA is presented before exceptional and
other non-underlying items. Exceptional and other non-underlying items comprise Woburn pre-opening losses and other
exceptional and non-underlying items. Woburn pre-opening losses relate to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA losses incurred

during the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2013, the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2014 and the 8 weeks ended 19 June 2014 in respect
of Woburn Village. Woburn opened to guests on 6 June 2014, but did not operate at full capacity until after 19 June 2014.
Other exceptional and non-underlying items relate to, among other things, costs incurred in respect of the Blackstone Funds’
exit from Center Parcs.

For a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualised Adjusted EBITDA to profit for the period, see
“Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information”.

In addition, this Offering Circular includes the following key performance indicators that Center Parcs’ Directors
use to set targets and measure performance against those targets.

_Occupancy_

Occupancy is the average number of units of accommodation occupied as a percentage of the total number
available. Units of accommodation are deemed to be occupied when utilised during the relevant period under review. When
units of accommodation are out of service for refurbishment, they are still included in the occupancy calculations. Center
Parcs is focused on driving occupancy levels to optimise the number of guests, which in turn increases accommodation
revenue and optimises on-site expenditure.

_Average Daily Rate (“ADR”)_

ADR is the average rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total accommodation income for the period divided by
the total number of accommodation nights sold. Center Parcs uses ADR to help measure and maximise its yield.

_Rent Per Available Lodge night (“RevPAL”)_

RevPAL is the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on the total accommodation income divided by
the total available number of accommodation nights. Center Parcs’ management believes RevPAL to be the most meaningful
key performance indicator because it takes into account both occupancy and ADR.

_Net on-site spend per lodge night_

Net on-site spend per lodge night is calculated as on-site spend at Center Parcs-operated units and the rent received
from concession partners (i.e. on-site revenue) for a period, divided by the sum of the number of guest-occupied lodges during
each night of such period.

_Forward bookings as a percentage of available capacity_

Forward bookings as a percentage of available capacity means the number of accommodation nights sold divided by
total available accommodation nights for the defined period. This indicator provides management with forward visibility of
future occupancy levels.

**EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION**

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain information concerning the exchange rate for
pounds sterling based upon the Bloomberg Composite Rate, expressed in U.S. dollars per £1.00 (rounded to three decimal
places). The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a “best market” calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to
the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks.
The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. The rates
may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and other financial
information appearing in this Offering Circular. “Average” means the average of the exchange rates on the last business day
of each month for annual averages and the average of the exchange rates on each business day during the relevant period for
monthly averages. These exchange rates are provided only for the convenience of the reader. No representation is made that
amounts in pounds sterling have been, could have been, or could be converted into U.S. dollars, or vice versa. As of 17 July
2015, the mid-rate was USD 1.5537 per £1.00.

**OVERVIEW**

Center Parcs is a leading UK short-break holiday business, attracting approximately 2 million guests in financial
year 2015. Center Parcs operates five specially constructed holiday villages in the United Kingdom: Sherwood Forest in
Nottinghamshire, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Elveden Forest in Suffolk, Whinfell Forest in Cumbria (together, the
“Original Villages”) and the more recent addition of Woburn Village in Bedfordshire (“Woburn Village”), which opened to
guests on 6 June 2014. Each village is set in a forest environment amongst approximately 400 acres of forest around a lake
and is open 365 days per year.

Woodland, water and a natural environment are the essential elements of a Center Parcs break. Within this
comfortable, quiet, car-free and family-friendly setting, each of the Center Parcs villages provides guests with high quality
accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. In total, there are 4,127 units of accommodation across its five
villages, which can accommodate 21,712 guests per day at 100% occupancy. The focal point and key attraction of each
village is an all-weather indoor sub-tropical swimming paradise, featuring a selection of water activities including a wave
pool, river slides and rides, children’s pools and jacuzzis. Center Parcs’ on-site experiences also include outdoor activities
such as cycling, boating and zip wires; indoor activities such as ten-pin bowling, badminton and pottery; and amenities such
as spas, food and beverage and retail. A significant proportion of Center Parcs’ revenue is generated from guests’ on-site
spending, including for leisure and spa activities, food and beverage and retail, representing 41% of total revenue in financial
year 2015.

Center Parcs has a well-established brand in the UK for providing high quality experiences and facilities and targets
a primary guest base of affluent families. Center Parcs benefits from strong guest loyalty with approximately 35% of guests
returning within 14 months and approximately 60% returning over a five-year period. In addition, Center Parcs believes that
its business model is difficult to replicate due to the lack of suitable locations for the development of holiday parks and high
development costs and Center Parcs is well positioned to continue to grow its business. In March 2015, Center Parcs was
named “Best UK Family Holiday Provider” in the Tommy’s Awards for the twelfth year in a row, in addition to receiving a
Globe Travel Award in 2015, “Investor in People” accreditation in 2013 and retaining its “Hospitality Assured” Premier status
in 2014, achieving the highest score in its sector.

Center Parcs’ villages typically draw on a regional population of guests who are attracted to the convenience of
being within a relatively short driving distance from home. Over 80% of the UK population lives within a 2.5 hour drive of at
least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two hour drive of the village they
choose to visit. Center Parcs believes that the proximity of the majority of guests to its villages combined with the easy
accessibility of the villages by car make Center Parcs a popular and convenient holiday option. Occupancy levels at Center
Parcs’ Original Villages have been consistently high: 97.2% in each of financial years 2013 and 2014 and 97.5% in financial
year 2015. Occupancy levels have averaged over 94% in the last 15 years and approximately 97% in the last five years despite
the expansion of existing accommodation offerings at Center Parcs’ Original Villages and the recent opening of Woburn
Village. Woburn Village achieved 94.1% occupancy in the 44 weeks ended 23 April 2015 following a short ramp-up period
since opening to guests on 6 June 2014.

For the financial year 2015, on an unaudited pro forma combined basis, giving effect to the Woburn Acquisition and
Accession, Center Parcs had revenue of £386.9 million and Annualised Adjusted EBITDA of £186.1 million, representing an
Annualised Adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.1%. For a reconciliation of Annualised Adjusted EBITDA to loss/profit see
“Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information”.

Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are broadly evenly split amongst Center Parcs’ villages (including Woburn),
reflecting both the individual strength of each village and the diversity of Center Parcs’ asset base.

**History of the Center Parcs Group**

The Center Parcs concept was pioneered by Piet Derksen in the late 1960s in the Netherlands as a new form of selfcatering, high-comfort holiday village, complemented with heated bungalows, open fires, central heating, colour TVs and
covered swimming pools. Derksen expanded the chain over the course of the following two decades into Belgium, France and
Germany, and, in 1987, the first Center Parcs opened in the United Kingdom at Sherwood. The first British village was
closely followed by a second at Elveden in 1989. In 1994, Center Parcs further expanded with the creation of the third village,
Longleat, near Bath. In 2001, Center Parcs acquired the Oasis Holiday Village (now called Whinfell) in the northwest of
England from the Bourne Leisure Group, thus enhancing Center Parcs’ geographic footprint in the UK.

Certain investment funds advised by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (the “Blackstone Funds”) bought the
operating business in May 2006 and subsequently delisted it from the London Stock Exchange where it had been listed on the
AIM in 2003 and on the Main Market in 2005. Shortly thereafter, Blackstone Funds purchased the property companies
owning the four Original Villages in June 2006. The overall combined business was refinanced in December 2006 and
February 2012, with a partial refinancing in June 2015.

Since 2006, Center Parcs has implemented programmes to upgrade accommodation and to upgrade and expand onsite offerings. In November 2010, Center Parcs received reserved matters planning approval of its plan to develop and build a
fifth village situated near Woburn in Bedfordshire. The development of Woburn Village commenced in May 2012 and opened
to guests on 6 June 2014 as planned. In June 2015, Woburn Village acceded to the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement
and other Transaction Documents as a Borrower and an Obligor.

In June 2015, certain funds managed by affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (the “Brookfield Funds” or
the “Sponsor”) agreed to acquire Center Parcs from the Blackstone Funds.

**Key Strengths**

**_Unique, market-leading short break holiday business._**

Center Parcs believes that it provides a unique product in the UK holiday market in terms of scale, quality and
standard of accommodation and amenities. Center Parcs is a market leader with an approximate 20% market share of the UK
holiday centres market in 2013. Each Center Parcs village is set in approximately 400 acres of forest around a lake, with
numerous retail and food and beverage offerings, as well as approximately 150 leisure and spa related activities and an indoor
sub-tropical swimming paradise. Each village has on average 825 lodges with capacity for 4,300 guests. Center Parcs believes
that it is the only large-scale UK business offering this type of family-focused, year-round, all-weather, short-break package,
in a forest environment.

**_Difficult to replicate concept with well-known brand and loyal, affluent customer base._**

The Center Parcs villages are characterised by a number of qualities that Center Parcs believes make its business
model difficult to replicate in the United Kingdom. These include:



- limited appropriate sites for villages, which require large forested areas near major population centres;

- long lead time needed to develop new villages due to the stringent requirements for obtaining planning permits;



- significant initial investment cost in addition to on-going capital expenditure required for further development
and operations of the business; and



      - a wide range of specialised operations and planning expertise required to develop and operate a village.

Center Parcs’ unique product offering has generated strong brand recognition and guest loyalty. Center Parcs believes
that it has high brand recognition in the UK and is considered among the top brands for high quality short breaks in the UK.


Center Parcs’ “intention to return” score was 95% in financial year 2015. Approximately 35% of Center Parcs’
guests return within 14 months and approximately 60% return over a five-year period. Its active guest base grew to
approximately 460,000 households in 2015.

Center Parcs is also an award-winning brand, having recently been named “Best UK Family Holiday Provider” in
the Tommy’s Awards for the twelfth year in a row, in addition to receiving Globe Travel Award in 2015, “Investor in People”
accreditation in 2013 and retaining its “Hospitality Assured” Premier status in 2014, achieving the highest score in its sector.


Center Parcs’ guest profile has remained stable over time and consists of the highest earning categories of the UK
population. According to management estimates, 84% of guests are identified under the ACORN classification as “affluent
achievers”, “rising prosperity” or “comfortable communities” based on postcode analysis.

**_Resilient growth through economic cycles._**


Resilient performance through economic cycles, during both downturns and recoveries, and also through additions
in capacity, has resulted in Center Parcs’ occupancy levels averaging over 94% in the last 15 years and approximately 97% in
the last five years, with occupancy levels at the Original Villages of 97.2%, 97.2% and 97.5% in 2013, 2014 and 2015,
respectively. Woburn Village achieved 94.1% occupancy in the 44 weeks ended 23 April 2015 following a short ramp-up
period since opening to guests on 6 June 2014.

Occupancy Units of Accommodation

High occupancy levels drive a significant proportion of revenue from guests’ on-site spending, which represented
41% of Center Parcs’ total revenue in financial year 2015.


ADR for Center Parcs’ Original Villages on average also consistently grew above inflation between financial year
2004 and financial year 2015, at a CAGR of 3.6%. During this period, growth in Center Parcs’ RevPAL outpaced inflation by
1.7 times and UK Revenue per Available Room (“UK RevPAR”) by four times. The growth in Center Parcs’ ADR has been
driven by yield management initiatives, demand and on-site investment, including in new types of accommodation and
upgrades to existing accommodation.

**_Unbroken revenue growth with strong visibility through forward-booking model._**

Center Parcs has experienced revenue growth each year over the last ten years, with revenue growing at a CAGR of
6.1% from financial year 2004 to financial year 2015. In addition, Center Parcs’ Adjusted EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of
8.8% from financial year 2004 to financial year 2015. Center Parcs places a strong emphasis on advance prepaid bookings,
which result in significant revenue visibility, with an average of 16 weeks booking-to-arrival time. For each of the financial
years 2013, 2014 and 2015, an average of 40% of the available accommodation nights at its Original Villages had been
booked by the beginning of the financial year, an average of 56.6% by the end of the first quarter, an average of 76.9%
halfway through the financial year, and an average of 95% two months before the end of the financial year.

Center Parcs collects 30% of the accommodation cost at the time of booking if completed more than ten weeks in
advance of the short break. The balance of the cost is collected ten weeks prior to the start of the break. If a guest books less
than ten weeks prior to the arrival date, the accommodation cost is payable in full on booking. Similarly, in financial year 2015,
approximately 60% of leisure and spa activities were pre-booked and pre-paid prior to arrival. This significant revenue visibility
allows Center Parcs to optimise its cost structure according to anticipated occupancy levels and demand throughout the year.

**_Sustainable cash flow generation._**

Center Parcs’ EBITDA margins have been underpinned by high occupancy levels and consistent growth in ADR.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins for the Original Villages grew significantly over the past ten years from 35.2% and
45.5%, respectively, in financial year 2004 to 43.6% and 46.2%, respectively, in financial year 2015. Relatively high
EBITDA margins combined with the negative working capital characteristics of the business due to its forward-booking
model and the relatively low maintenance capital expenditure requirements, which averaged £18 million per financial year
from financial year 2007 to financial 2015, has enabled Center Parcs to be highly cash generative, with an average free cash
flow margin (defined as EBITDA less total capital expenditure divided by revenue) of approximately 30% from financial year
2013 to financial year 2015.

**_Well-invested, diversified and high quality asset base._**

Center Parcs owns all five of its villages on either freehold titles or long leasehold titles, and with remaining lease
terms of between 58 years and 984 years, Center Parcs’ asset base has a long life and is diversified and stable. Revenue and
EBITDA are broadly evenly split amongst its villages, located in different parts of the UK, reflecting both the individual
strength of each village and the diversity of Center Parcs’ asset base.

Center Parcs has an on-going capital expenditure programme to maintain and enhance the quality of its asset base,
pursuant to which it has invested approximately £388 million at the Original Villages from financial year 2007 through financial
year 2015. Of this investment, £159 million represents maintenance capital expenditures. The remainder represents investment
capital expenditure, of which £139 million was invested to upgrade existing accommodation (historically, ADR achieved on
upgraded accommodation has typically been between 10% and 20% higher than the equivalent non-upgraded accommodation as
measured by sampled upgraded lodges compared against the equivalent non-upgraded lodges during financial years 2012 to 2014),
£34 million was invested to build new developments and £56 million went toward on-site development, including new leisure
activities, food and beverage offerings and facilities upgrades. In addition, Center Parcs has incurred approximately £250 million of
total initial development costs in respect of building Woburn Village (“Woburn Phase 1”).

**_Experienced management team with a track record of innovation._**

Center Parcs has an experienced management team with a proven ability to execute its business plans and achieve
results. In addition, Center Parcs’ management team has a track record of innovation reflected in its yield management initiatives,
innovation in on-site activities and food and beverage offerings, as well as development of new types of accommodation to help


5


-----

drive ADR. Most recently, the management team successfully opened Woburn Village on time and on budget. For the 44 weeks
ended 23 April 2015, Woburn Village achieved an ADR of approximately 25% above the average of the Original Villages.
Woburn Village reached 95% occupancy within the first full quarter of trading since opening to guests on 6 June 2014. With an
average length of service of over ten years by individual members of its management team, the management team is highly
experienced in providing the services that set Center Parcs apart from other UK leisure and holiday providers. We also expect to
benefit from the operational expertise, relationships, and management experience of the Brookfield group.

**Strategy**

**_Continue to grow revenue through yield management, flexible pricing, targeted marketing and customer relationship_**
**_management._**

Center Parcs actively manages pricing across its villages to maintain its high level of occupancy and to optimise
yield during periods of high demand. 100% of bookings are made directly with Center Parcs, with approximately 83% of
accommodation bookings made online in financial year 2015. Together with its strong emphasis on advance bookings
(average 16-week booking-to-arrival time period), this provides Center Parcs with significant operational information,
allowing it to respond quickly to customer trends in order to optimise its pricing. Center Parcs plans to continue to develop its
yield management and flexible pricing structure to further grow revenue, and to develop its customer relationship
management initiatives to increase demand from the affluent families that form its core guest base.

Center Parcs is investing in its systems to improve its digital capabilities, with the aim of optimising revenue growth
(the “Digital Roadmap”). Through this process, Center Parcs plans to introduce more sophisticated pricing tools in order to
increase demand through improved customer relationship management and targeted marketing. Center Parcs’ guest database
of approximately one million contacts allows it to undertake targeted marketing campaigns using a range of channels,
including direct mailings, online and digital marketing, television campaigns and email programmes focused on existing
customers. The Digital Roadmap comprises revenue optimisation tools to create automated price suggestions and intra-day
price changes, the creation of data hubs to enable Center Parcs to better target and tailor their guest services and identify
individual preferences, and the introduction of an improved booking platform. For more information on the Digital Roadmap,
see “Business — Information Technology”.

**_Continue to invest in revenue-enhancing upgrades of Center Parcs accommodation offering and to expand available_**
**_capacity._**

Center Parcs plans to continue to invest in upgrading the accommodation and facilities in its villages, and to
introduce new accommodation and on-site activities. Since 2007, Center Parcs has opened 110 new units of accommodation
at its Original Villages, and significantly upgraded 2,778 units (accounting for approximately 84% of total units), with the
remaining 533 units expected to be upgraded in the near to medium term at an average estimated cost of approximately
£50,000 per lodge.

There is also capacity for additional new builds of premium lodges at Center Parcs’ villages, which typically
achieve a premium over the rate achieved on standard lodges. Center Parcs believes that such premium lodges attract affluent
guests who are more likely to be high on-site spenders. Center Parcs plans to build approximately 100 new premium lodges at
Woburn Village. Under its existing planning decision, Center Parcs has planning permission for more than two-thirds of these
premium lodges, which are expected to open in 2017 (“Woburn Phase 2”) with the remaining premium lodges expected to
follow thereafter. In addition, Center Parcs currently plans to build around 100 new premium lodges and one-bedroom
apartments, subject to planning permission and other factors, at the Original Villages. The new premium lodges are expected
to include treehouses, waterside lodges, spa suites and other executive lodges. Center Parcs currently has planning permission
for more than a quarter of these new builds.

**_Disciplined investment in village experience._**

Center Parcs believes that there are several substantial development projects that could profitably expand Center
Parcs’ offering, including Project Atlantis, which involves the strategic enhancement of the signature sub-tropical swimming
paradise that features at each village. Center Parcs spent over £10 million between 2012 and 2015 on implementing Project
Atlantis. Improvements included the addition of a new raft ride, the Tropical Cyclone, and a new play area featuring
numerous slides and water feature at Elveden, in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The introduction of the Tropical Cyclone at
Elveden delivered a meaningful ADR increase. Over the next five years, Center Parcs plans to make similar upgrades to the
pool facilities at Longleat, Sherwood and Whinfell villages.

Center Parcs also intends to introduce new, as well as innovate upon, leisure activities at each village on a regular
basis. Development opportunities include introducing electric boats and expanding indoor climbing activities to all villages.
Center Parcs believes that such investments provide an enriched holiday experience particularly for the affluent families that
form its core guest base, and that an improved on-site offering helps to drive both accommodation and on-site revenue.

-----

**_Grow on-site spend._**

Center Parcs’ on-site revenue at the Original Villages grew at a CAGR of 3.4% from financial year 2013 to financial
year 2015. As Center Parcs’ guests typically remain on-site for the duration of their stay, Center Parcs believes that there are
opportunities to grow on-site spend further. For example, Center Parcs is currently developing a programme of enhanced
differentiation in pricing. Through the programme, prices of various offerings are expected to become flexible across villages or
seasons to more accurately reflect guest demand. In addition, Center Parcs expects to increase the range of products and
services available to guests. Further, Center Parcs aims to continue enhancing ease of payment for its guests by expanding
cashless payment options, currently available at selected areas at Woburn Village and Whinfell Village, across all its villages.

Center Parcs has franchise, licensing and concession agreements with various providers, such as Starbucks, Casual
Dining Group (formerly Tragus) (whose offering includes Café Rouge and Bella Italia) and SSP (whose offering includes
gastro pubs and fast food outlets). These concession partners enable guests to benefit from high street brand offerings and
Center Parcs to increase profitability through increased on-site spend. Center Parcs reviews these agreements periodically to
ensure that they remain economically attractive and meet its guests’ requirements. Center Parcs believes that there is also an
opportunity to increase revenue from its outside guests, especially through its Aqua Sana spa facilities, which Center Parcs
continues to upgrade and expand.

**_Continue to increase profitability through controlling costs._**

Center Parcs benefits from having a flexible cost base. Because of the high level of forward booking visibility of the
business, Center Parcs is able to manage its cost base effectively to meet its business requirements. As part of the strategy to
seek profitable growth, it intends to generate cost savings through increased efficiency at each village and at its head office.
Center Parcs also plans to continue to improve and streamline booking options. For example, it recently launched an app that
allows guests to book activities, check their itinerary and find their way around the villages.

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**

**Refinancing of the Class A1 Loan and the redemption of the Class A1 Notes**

On 11 June 2015, the Center Parcs Group refinanced the Class A1 Loan granted by the Issuer to the Borrowers on
the Closing Date under the Original Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. The Borrowers of the Class A1 Loan fully
prepaid the Class A1 Loan (together with accrued interest on the Class A1 Loan up to the Second Closing Date and an amount
equal to the Class A make-whole payment due in respect of the Class A1 Notes) using £323 million of the proceeds of the
Second Class A Loans granted by the Issuer to the Borrowers on the Second Closing Date under the Class A Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement. The Issuer used the proceeds of the repayment of the Class A1 Loan to fund the corresponding redemption
of the Class A1 Notes. The repayment of the Class A1 Loan and the corresponding redemption of the Class A1 Notes are
referred to in this Offering Circular as the “Class A Notes Refinancing”. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial
_Information”, “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of Other Indebtedness”._

**Acquisition of CP Woburn Opco**

In November 2010, Center Parcs received reserved matters planning approval of its plan to develop and build a fifth
village situated near Woburn in Bedfordshire. In 2012, new corporate entities, including CP Woburn Opco and its holding
company, CP Woburn Holdco S.à r.l. (“CP Woburn Holdco”), were established outside of the Obligor Group to facilitate the
ownership, development and financing of Woburn Village. The development of Woburn Village was completed and, on
6 June 2014, Woburn Village opened to guests.

Concurrently with the Class A Notes Refinancing, Center Parcs (Holdings 3) Limited acquired the entire issued
share capital of CP Woburn Opco from CP Woburn Holdco and CP Woburn Opco acceded to the Class A Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement and the other Transaction Documents as a Borrower and an Obligor (the “Woburn Acquisition and
**Accession”). On the Second Closing Date and in connection with the Woburn Acquisition and Accession, (a) Center Parcs**
(Holdings 3) Limited borrowed £19 million of the proceeds of the Second Class A Notes from the Issuer and used such funds
towards the purchase price for the shares in CP Woburn Opco and (b) CP Woburn Opco borrowed £142 million of the
proceeds of the Second Class A Notes from the Issuer to repay its existing loan facility.

Following the completion of the Woburn Acquisition and Accession, the business of CP Woburn Opco may be
reorganised to transfer the business and operation of Woburn Village to CP Opco and to transfer the legal title in the property
for Woburn Village to another Obligor (the “Reorganisation”). If the Reorganisation takes place, it will involve, among other
things, transfers of shares, properties and leases between certain members of the Center Parcs Group and the novation of the
indebtedness incurred by CP Woburn Opco under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement to other members of the
Center Parcs Group. If undertaken, the Reorganisation will not have any impact on the financing structure or the security
package for the Class B2 Notes.

**Trading Update**

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited’s results of operations for the 8 weeks ended 18 June 2015 have been in line with
management’s expectations.

Forward bookings for the Original Villages are ahead of the prior year, with 58.9% of the capacity for financial year
2016 booked as of 16 July 2015 (as compared to 54.9% as of 17 July 2014 in financial year 2015). ADR for the first trading
quarter (being the first twelve weeks) of financial year 2016 was marginally ahead of the ADR for the first trading quarter of
financial year 2015, reflecting a modest impact from the opening of Woburn Village. As of 16 July 2015, ADR for forward
bookings for the Original Villages for the final 40 weeks (representing the last three trading quarters) of financial year 2016
indicates a level of ADR growth comparable to that prior to the opening of Woburn Village.

Occupancy for Woburn Village for the first trading quarter of financial year 2016 is in line with that for the Original
Villages. For the remaining three trading quarters of financial year 2016, forward bookings for Woburn Village are in line
with such bookings for the same period in the prior financial year (representing the trading quarters in financial year 2015
when Woburn Village was fully operational).

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**The Acquisition**

On 2 June 2015, BSREP II Cayman Blocker Pooling L.P. (the “Purchaser”), an entity managed by affiliates of
Brookfield Asset Management Inc., entered into a sale and purchase deed (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with CP Cayman
Topco, CP MGMT Nominee Limited and others (the “Sellers”) to acquire the entire issued share capital of CP MGMT Limited
and CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited (together, the “Target Companies”) and certain shares in the capital of Topco (the
“Acquisition”). The consummation of the Acquisition pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement is not subject to any anti-trust,
regulatory or other conditions and is expected to occur on or prior to 3 August 2015 or such other date as CP Cayman Topco
and the Purchaser agree (the “Completion Date”). The Acquisition Agreement contains customary closing obligations. If any
party fails to comply with such obligations, the Acquisition Agreement may be terminated by the non-defaulting party. The
Purchaser assigned and novated its rights and obligations under the Acquisition Agreement and other documents entered into in
connection with the Acquisition to BSREP II Center Parcs Jersey 2 Limited, or Bidco, an indirect subsidiary of the Purchaser.

In connection with the Acquisition, certain employees and members of management will reinvest part of their
shareholding in CP MGMT Limited in BSREP II Center Parcs Jersey Limited and, as of the Completion Date, we expect
certain employees and members of management will indirectly hold approximately 0.7% of the share capital of Bidco.

The Acquisition is being financed through a combination of the proceeds of the Exchangeable Notes offering,
which, pursuant to the terms of the Mandatory Exchange, will be mandatorily exchanged for the Class B2 Notes to be issued
immediately following the consummation of the Acquisition, and by equity provided by the investors in the Brookfield Funds.

**The issuance of the Exchangeable Notes and the issuance and exchange of the Class B2 Notes**

The Exchangeable Notes are being offered in connection with the financing of the Acquisition and related
transactions and will be issued before the closing of the Acquisition. Pending the Completion Date, the gross proceeds from
the offering of the Exchangeable Notes, or Escrowed Funds, will be deposited into the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms
of the Escrow Agreement among, inter alios, the Exchangeable Note Issuer and the Escrow Agent dated as of the
Exchangeable Note Issue Date for the account of the Exchangeable Noteholders.

Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the Exchangeable Note Trust Deed, the Exchangeable Notes will
be exchangeable for the Class B2 Notes on the Third Closing Date, immediately following the consummation of the
Acquisition and upon issuance of the Class B2 Notes (the “Mandatory Exchange Event”). On the occurrence of the
Mandatory Exchange Event, the Exchangeable Notes will be automatically exchanged for an aggregate nominal amount of the
Class B2 Notes equal to the aggregate nominal amount of the Exchangeable Notes.

If the Mandatory Exchange Event does not occur on or prior to the Longstop Date of 30 November 2015, the
Exchangeable Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption and the Exchangeable Note Issuer will redeem all (but
not some only) of the Exchangeable Notes at 100% of the aggregate issue price together with accrued but unpaid interest to
the date of such redemption. See “Terms and Conditions of the Exchangeable Notes” included in Annex A hereto for the full
terms and conditions of the Exchangeable Notes and the Mandatory Exchange.

**Refinancing of the Original Class B Loan and repurchase of the Original Class B Notes**

The Center Parcs Group intends to refinance the Original Class B Loan granted by the Issuer to the Borrowers under
the Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement on the Third Closing Date. The Borrowers of the Class B2 Loan will


8


-----

use part of the proceeds thereof to (a) repay the Original Class B Loan (including the payment of any prepayment premium
and any accrued and unpaid interest) or (b) to fund a tender offer for the Original Class B Notes as described below. On
20 July 2015, Bidco launched a tender offer to purchase or procure the purchase of the Original Class B Notes in full, together
with accrued interest up to the date of purchase. All of the Original Class B Notes properly tendered prior to the expiration of
the tender offer will be purchased by the Borrowers on the Third Closing Date. The remaining outstanding amount of Original
Class B Notes are expected to be redeemed thereafter. The Borrower will deliver to the Issuer the purchased Original Class B
Notes in satisfaction, prepayment and discharge of a pro rata portion of each Borrower’s liability under the Original Class B
Loan. The repayment of the Original Class B Loan and the purchase of the Original Class B Notes are referred to in this
Offering Circular as the “Refinancing”.

In connection with the Refinancing, Topco intends to declare and pay a dividend to Bidco in an amount equal to the
interest which would have accrued on the Original Class B Notes purchased on the Third Closing Date from (and including)
the Third Closing Date to (but excluding) the interest payment date falling on 28 August 2015 (the “Original Class B Notes
Dividend”).

The Acquisition, the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, the issuance and exchange of the Class B2 Notes, the
Refinancing and the payment of the Original Class B Notes Dividend are collectively referred to as the “Transactions”. The
issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, the issuance and exchange of the Class B2 Notes and the Refinancing are collectively
referred to as the “Financing Transactions”.

**THE ISSUER OF THE CLASS B2 NOTES**

CPUK Finance Limited, or the Issuer, is a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Jersey. The
Issuer has conducted no operations or other material activities other than in relation to the issuance of the Class A Notes, the

**_Ranking: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** The Class B2 Notes will be constituted by the Second Supplemental Note
Trust Deed, will be contractually subordinated to the Class A Notes as to
payment and will rank junior with respect to security, other than with respect
to the security created under the Topco Security Documents.

The Class B2 Loan will be contractually subordinated to, among others, the
Class A Loans, the Liquidity Facility and certain hedging arrangements as to
payment and will rank junior with respect to security, other than with respect
to the security created under the Topco Security Documents.

**_Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan_**
**_Agreement: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** On the Closing Date, the Issuer, the Initial Borrowers, the Guarantors and the
Borrower Security Trustee, among others, entered into a junior loan
agreement (the “Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer
lent to the Initial Borrowers a subordinated secured facility in an aggregate
principal amount of £280.0 million (the “Original Class B Facility” and the
advance thereunder, the “Original Class B Loan”). On the Second Closing
Date, the Issuer, the Borrowers of the Original Class B Loan, the Guarantors
and the Borrower Security Trustee amended and restated the Original Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement to reflect the accession of CP Woburn
Opco as a Guarantor of the Original Class B Loan.

On the Third Closing Date, the Issuer will fund the Class B2 Loan under the
Class B2 Facility pursuant to the terms of a second amended and restated
junior loan agreement between, among others, the Issuer, the Borrowers, the
Guarantors and the Borrower Security Trustee (the “Class B Issuer/
**Borrower Loan Agreement”).**

**_Guarantees: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** The Class B2 Notes will not be guaranteed by any person, except that the
Class B2 Notes will have the indirect benefit of the Topco Payment
Undertaking.

The Class B2 Loan will be guaranteed by the Guarantors.

**_Expected maturity of the Class B2 Notes: . ._** 2020 (the “Class B2 Note Expected Maturity Date”).

**_Expected maturity of the Class B2 Loan: . . ._** The Class B2 Loan is expected to be redeemed in full by the date falling three
Business Days prior to the Class B Note Expected Maturity Date (the “Class
**B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date”).**

If, on the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date, the Class B2 Loan remains
outstanding, Topco will undertake, under the terms of the Topco Payment
Undertaking, to procure the payment of an amount equal to the aggregate of:
(a) the then principal balance on any Class B Loans; (b) accrued but unpaid
interest outstanding in respect of any Class B Loans; and (c) all other amounts
outstanding under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. Failure by
Topco to pay such amount will give the right to the Borrower Security
Trustee (on instruction from the Class B Note Trustee as directed by the Class


14


-----

B Noteholders) to enforce the security granted to it pursuant to the Topco
Security Documents (on trust for the Issuer), including the security granted by
Topco over the shares Topco holds in CP Cayman Limited and the security
granted by CP Cayman Limited over the shares CP Cayman Limited holds in
Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements — Topco Payment Undertaking”. The Borrowers will use such_
funds to repay the Class B Loans. The Issuer will then redeem Class B Notes
in an amount corresponding to the amount of the Class B Loans which have
been so repaid.

**_Final maturity of the Class B2 Notes: . . . . ._** The Issuer is required to redeem the Class B2 Notes in full on the Class B2
Note Final Maturity Date, being 28 February 2042.

**_Final maturity of the Class B2 Loan: . . . . . ._** The final maturity date in respect of the Class B2 Loan will be the later of (a)
the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date; and (b) the earliest of: (i) the date
on which all amounts outstanding under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement have been irrevocably paid or discharged in full; (ii) the date on
which the Class A Loans are accelerated; and (iii) the Loan Interest Payment
Date falling on 2042 (the “Class B Loan Final Maturity Date”).

**_Interest on the Class B2 Notes: . . . . . . . . . . ._** % per annum from (and including) the Exchangeable Note Issue Date up
to (but excluding) the Note Interest Payment Date falling on 2020 (the
“Class B2 Note Step-Down Date”) and, thereafter, % per annum (each,
as applicable, a “Class B2 Interest Rate”).

If on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the Issuer receives a payment of interest
(whether in whole or in part) on the Class B2 Loan from the Borrowers in
accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, then the Issuer
will be obliged to make a corresponding payment of interest (in whole or in
part, as the case may be) on the Class B2 Notes on the corresponding Note
Interest Payment Date. If on any Note Interest Payment Date, the amount
received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B2 Loan
is not sufficient to pay the interest accrued on the Class B2 Notes during the
immediately preceding Note Interest Period in full, the amount of interest
accrued up to any such Note Interest Payment Date that is not paid by the
Issuer on such Note Interest Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued
but deferred interest, being a “Deferred Interest Amount”) and such Deferred
Interest Amount shall continue to accrue interest at the then applicable Class
B2 Note Interest Rate until it is paid by the Issuer in full.

If on any Loan Interest Payment Date:

(i) the Issuer receives a payment of interest on the Class B2 Loan from the
Borrower in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement in excess of the amount of interest accrued on the Class B2
Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period; and

(ii) on such Note Interest Payment Date, a Deferred Interest Amount in
respect of any prior Note Interest Period remains outstanding,

then the Issuer shall apply such excess to reduce the then outstanding
Deferred Interest Amount. Interest and the aggregate amount of all Deferred
Interest Amounts then unpaid on the Class B2 Notes and any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable by the Issuer in pounds
sterling on the Class B2 Note Final Maturity Date.

**_Interest on the Class B2 Loan: . . . . . . . . . . ._** % per annum from (and including) the Exchangeable Note Issue Date up
to (but excluding) the Loan Interest Payment Date falling on 2020 (the
“Class B2 Loan Step-Down Date”) and, thereafter, % per annum (each,
as applicable, a “Class B2 Interest Rate”).

From (and including) the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date, interest will
accrue on the Class B2 Loan at the applicable Class B2 Interest Rate until (but
excluding) 2042 (the “Class B2 Loan Final Maturity Date”) but such
accruing interest will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest being


15


-----

a “Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amount”) and such Class B2 Loan
Deferred Interest Amount will accrue interest at the applicable Class B2
Interest Rate until paid by the Borrowers in full. On each Loan Interest
Payment Date, interest accrued on the Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest
Amount during the immediately preceding Loan Interest Period will be added
to the then outstanding Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and thereafter
paid at the times and in the same manner as the Class B2 Loan Deferred
Interest Amount. The Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon will be payable by the Borrowers only on
the earlier of (x) the date on which the Class A Loans are repaid in full (the
“Initial Payment Date”) and (y) the Class B2 Note Final Maturity Date;
provided that if on the Initial Payment Date, the Borrowers do not have
sufficient cash to pay the Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon in full on such date in accordance with the
Borrower Priorities of Payments, any unpaid Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest
Amount and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon will not fall due then but
will continue to be deferred and will only fall due for payment on any
subsequent Loan Interest Payment Date to the extent of the cash available to
the Borrowers for such purpose determined in accordance with the Borrower
Priorities of Payments.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the Borrowers receive New Equity
Funds, (ii) the Topco Security is enforced and proceeds thereof are available
for this purpose and/or (iii) the Transaction Security is enforced and funds are
available for this purpose pursuant to the applicable Priorities of Payments as
described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —
_Intercreditor Agreement”, then the Borrowers will be required to make_
payment of interest on all of the Class B Loans, any Class B Loan Deferred
Interest Amounts and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, and the Issuer
will be required to make the corresponding payments of interest on the Class
B Notes using the proceeds of such payments made by (directly or indirectly,
or on behalf of) the Borrowers.

**_Cash Lock-Up: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** If at any time the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is not satisfied
(including if the Class A FCF DSCR falls below 135%) then no payments
(including payments of interest), unless funded out of new equity, may be
made in respect of the Class B2 Loan and, consequently, the Class B2 Notes.
See “Description of other Indebtedness — Class A IBLA”.

**_Class B2 Note Interest Payment Dates: . . . ._** Semi-annually in each year on 28 February and 28 August, subject to
adjustment for non-Business Days (starting 28 February 2016) (the “Note
**Interest Payment Date”). Interest on the Class B2 Notes will accrue from**
(and including) the Exchangeable Note Issue Date.

**_Class B2 Loan Interest Payment Dates: . . . ._** Each day falling three Business Days prior to a Note Interest Payment Date
(the “Loan Interest Payment Dates”).

**_Security for the Class B2 Notes: . . . . . . . . . ._** The Class B2 Notes will be secured on a subordinated basis by first-ranking
security in respect of substantially all of the Issuer’s property and assets,
which also secures the Class A Notes, including the Issuer’s rights against
each Obligor under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the
Borrower Deed of Charge (including the security trusts created thereunder),
the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Cash Management Agreement, the
Issuer Corporate Services Agreement, the Issuer Jersey Corporate Services
Agreement, the Issuer Account Bank Agreement and the Agency Agreement
and its rights in respect of its bank accounts and “Eligible Investments”. In
addition, the Class B2 Notes will have the benefit of the Topco Security
created under the Topco Security Documents in favour of the Borrower
Security Trustee. For details of the security for the Class B2 Notes, see
“Terms and Conditions of the Class B2 Notes — Condition 2.2 (Security).”

**_Security for the Class B2 Loan: . . . . . . . . . ._** The Class B2 Loan will be secured on a subordinated basis by first-ranking
security in respect of, among other things, all of the Obligors’ right, title and
interest in its assets pursuant to the Borrower Deed of Charge and will have
the benefit of security interests created by the Topco Security Documents.

The Class B2 Loan will share security with, among others, the Class A Loans,
the Liquidity Facility and certain hedging arrangements; provided that the
Class B2 Loan will rank junior to the foregoing with respect to the application
of enforcement proceeds, other than in respect of the Topco Security.

The shared security package will include first ranking mortgages or fixed
charges of, among other things, the freehold and leasehold interests in the
properties which are owned by the Obligors, including CP Woburn Opco, and
fixed or floating charges over all other property, undertakings and assets of
each Obligor, including CP Woburn Opco. In addition, each Obligor has
granted a first-ranking legal mortgage over the shares it owns in any English
Obligor. See Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Borrower
_Security Documents — Borrower Deed of Charge” and “Description of_
_Certain Financing Arrangements — Borrower Security Documents —_
_Woburn Deed of Charge”._

**_Topco Payment Undertaking; Topco_**
**_Security: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** Pursuant to an amended and restated deed of undertaking to be entered into
on the Third Closing Date between the Issuer, Topco, CP Opco and the
Borrower Security Trustee, Topco will undertake to procure the payment of
an amount equal to the aggregate of (a) the then principal balance of any
Class B Loans; (b) accrued and unpaid interest outstanding in respect of any
Class B Loans; and (c) all other amounts outstanding under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (the “Topco Payment Undertaking”) in
the specified circumstances described therein. The Borrowers will be obliged
to use such amount to prepay a corresponding amount of the Class B Loans
and the Issuer will then redeem a corresponding amount of Class B Notes.
Further details in respect of this deed are set out in “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements — Topco Payment Undertaking”._

The obligations of Topco under the Topco Payment Undertaking are secured
in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee with (a) a mortgage, charge and
other security interests granted by Topco over the shares of CP Cayman
Limited, together with a floating charge granted over all of Topco’s other
assets pursuant to a share security agreement, to be entered into on the Third
Closing Date (the “Topco Share Security Agreement”) and (b) a pledge
granted by CP Cayman Limited over the shares of Center Parcs (Holdings 1)
Limited together with a floating charge over all of CP Cayman Limited’s other
assets pursuant to a security agreement, to be entered into on the Third Closing
Date (the “CP Cayman Security Agreement”). The security interests created
under the Topco Share Security Agreement, the CP Cayman Security
Agreement and the other Topco Security Documents constitutes the “Topco
**Security”. The Class A Notes and the Class A Loans will not have the benefit**
of the Topco Payment Undertaking and the security interests created under the
Topco Security Documents.

Further details in respect of these agreements are set out in “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement”, “Description_
_of Certain Financing Arrangements — Topco Share Security Agreement” and_
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — CP Cayman Security
_Agreement”._

**_Optional and mandatory redemption: . . . . ._** The Class B2 Notes are pass-through notes, and will be subject to mandatory
redemption prior to the Class B2 Note Final Maturity Date if and to the extent
that the Borrowers make principal repayments or prepayments to the Issuer in
respect of the Class B2 Loan, either at the option of the Borrowers or following
any enforcement of the Topco Share Security or the Transaction Security.

Any such redemption of the Class B2 Notes will be on the same terms and at
the same prices (including any applicable premium) as for the prepayment of
the Class B2 Loan.

It is expected that, because of the terms of the Topco Payment Undertaking
and the Topco Security Documents, the Borrowers will elect to prepay the
Class B2 Loan on or before the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date, but


17


-----

they are not obliged to do so and the Issuer is therefore not obliged to redeem
the Class B2 Notes on the Class B2 Note Expected Maturity Date.

At any time on or after 2017, the Class B2 Loans will be prepayable at
the option of the Borrowers, in whole or in part, at the purchase prices set out
in “Description of the Class B2 Loan — Prepayment — Optional
_Prepayment”._

At any time prior to 2017, the Borrowers may prepay some or all of
the Class B2 Loans at a prepayment price equal to 100% of their principal
amount outstanding plus (i) accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, and (ii) a make-whole premium as specified in the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

In addition, prior to 2017, the Borrowers may on one or more
occasions use the net proceeds of specified equity offerings to prepay up to
40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Class B2 Loan, at a purchase
price equal to % of the aggregate principal amount of the Class B2 Loan,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts, if any, up to the
prepayment date, provided that at least 60% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the Class B2 Loan in issue remains outstanding after the
prepayment.

The funds received by the Issuer from the prepayment of the Class B2 Loan
will be used by the Issuer to redeem a corresponding principal amount of
outstanding Class B2 Notes in accordance with the Class B2 Conditions. See
“Terms and Conditions of the Class B2 Notes — Condition 5 (Redemption,
_Purchase and Cancellation)”._

**_Mandatory offers to Purchase for Class B2_**
**_Change of Control and Asset Sales: . . . . ._** The terms of the asset sales covenant in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement require the Borrowers to use the proceeds of certain asset sales to
either invest in additional assets or repay certain other indebtedness, and if
they do not, to use such excess proceeds since such asset sale to make an offer
to repurchase the Class B2 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Class B2 Loan Deferred
Interest Amount, if any, any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase.

Following a Class B2 Change of Control (as defined in the Class B Issuer/
Borrower Loan Agreement), the Borrowers will be required to offer to
repurchase all or any part of the Class B2 Notes at a repurchase price equal to
101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Class B2
Loan Deferred Interest Amount, if any, any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. See
“Description of the Class B2 Loan”.

**_Early redemption for tax and other_**
**_reasons: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** The Class B2 Notes and the Class B2 Loan may be redeemed or repaid at the
option of the Issuer, in whole but not in part, at any time following certain
changes in tax laws and/or other laws at a price equal to 100% of their
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional
amounts if any, provided certain conditions are satisfied, including that the
Issuer has sufficient funds to make such redemption or repayment. See
_“Description of the Class B2 Loan — Taxes — Repayment for Tax Reasons”_
_and “Terms and Conditions of the Class B2 Notes — Condition 5_
_(Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation)”._

**_Class B2 Loan Financial Covenants: . . . . . ._** Under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Obligors will be
required to maintain a ratio (expressed as a percentage) of free cash flow to
total debt service charges (the “Class B FCF DSCR”) equal to 100% on each
Financial Covenant Test Date.


18


-----

The Obligors will have the benefit of certain cure rights in the event that the
Class B FCF DSCR is less than 100%. See “Description of the Class B2
_Loan”._

**_Certain other Class B2 Loan covenants: . . ._** The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will limit, among other things,
Topco and the Obligors with respect to:

                            - the incurrence or guarantee of additional indebtedness;

                            - the payment of dividends or other distributions on, and the redemption or
repurchase of, its equity;

                            - the making of certain restricted payments and investments;

                            - the incurrence of certain liens;

                            - the imposition of restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay
dividends and other payments to members of the Group;

                            - the transfer, lease, sale or other disposition of certain assets;

                            - the merger, consolidation with, or sale of substantially all of the Group’s
assets to, other entities;

                            - the entry into certain transactions with affiliates; and

                            - the impairment of the security interest for the holders of Class B Notes.

Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and
qualifications. See “Description of the Class B2 Loan”.

**_Events of Default: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** No Class B Note Event of Default or Class B Loan Event of Default may
occur with respect to the Class B Notes or any Class B Loans while the Class
A Notes or Class A Loans are outstanding (until after an acceleration of the
Class A Notes or Class A Loans, respectively). However the Class B
Noteholders have the ability to demand repayment by Topco pursuant to the
Topco Payment Undertaking and direct the Borrower Security Trustee to
enforce the security granted pursuant to the Topco Security Documents upon
the occurrence of any Share Enforcement Event.

**_Share Enforcement Event: . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** Each of the following will constitute a Share Enforcement Event under the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, among others:

                            - any default in the payment of interest or additional amounts, if any, on a
Class B Loan (subject to a 30-day grace period);

                            - any amount remaining outstanding under a Class B Loan at the close of
business on the Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date of such Class B
Loan;

                            - any failure to pay principal or premium on a Class B Loan upon any
optional redemption, required repurchase or declaration;

                            - any failure to comply with the covenant described under the heading
“Description of the Class B2 Loan — Class B2 Change of Control”
(other than a failure to purchase Class B Notes which will constitute a
Share Enforcement Event per the above) (subject to 30 day grace
period);

                            - any failure to comply with the covenant described under the heading
“Description of the Class B2 Loan — Certain Covenants — Limitation
_on Holding Company Activities”;_

Borrower Loan Agreement (subject to a 60-day grace period);


19

                            - default under any indebtedness that results from a failure to pay principal
when due or results in acceleration of such indebtedness (subject to a
£10 million threshold);

                            - certain judgment defaults (subject to a £10 million threshold and 60-day
grace period);

                            - any impairment of the security interest granted in respect of material
collateral (subject to a 10-business day grace period); and

                            - any impairment of a guarantee.

If a Share Enforcement Event occurs and is continuing, the Borrower Security
Trustee acting upon instructions of the Issuer Security Trustee as directed by the
Class B Note Trustee, who shall be required to act if directed by the holders of at
least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Class B Notes, will be able to
enforce the Topco Security, subject to certain requirements being met. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor” and
“Description of the Class B2 Loan — Share Enforcement Event”.

If at any time either (i) no amounts remain outstanding under any Class A
Notes or (ii) an acceleration of the amounts outstanding under any Class A
Loans has occurred, each of the Share Enforcement Events specified above
will also constitute a Class B Loan Event of Default.

**_Withholding tax on Notes: . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** All payments in respect of the Class B2 Notes will be made without
withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes,
levies, duties, imposts, assessments or charges of whatsoever nature unless
the Issuer or any Paying Agent is required by applicable law to make any
payment in respect of the Class B2 Notes subject to any such withholding or
deduction.

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any taxes imposed or
levied by or on behalf of a relevant tax jurisdiction will at any time be
required to be made from any payments made in respect to the Class B2
Notes, including payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price,
interest or premium, the Issuer will, subject to certain exceptions, be obliged
to pay additional amounts in respect of any such withholding or deduction,
such that the net amount received by the holders of the Class B2 Notes is not
less than the amount they would have received in the absence of such
withholding.

**_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory_**
**_Redemption: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** For information regarding the escrow of the proceeds of the Exchangeable
Notes offering and the special mandatory redemption, see “The Exchangeable

Refinancing and in each case, the payment of fees, costs and expenses related
thereto. See “Use of Proceeds”.

**_Governing law: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** The Class B2 Notes, the Class B2 Loan, the Note Trust Deed, the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Issuer Deed of Charge will be
governed by English law.

**_Absence of public market for the Class B_**
**_Notes: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** The Class B2 Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no

**Unaudited Annualised Adjusted EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2015**

Annualised Adjusted EBITDA reflects the annualisation of Woburn’s Adjusted EBITDA in the unaudited pro forma
combined Adjusted EBITDA. Woburn opened to guests on 6 June 2014. The annualisation effect is calculated by dividing
Woburn’s Adjusted EBITDA of £32.5 million for the 44 weeks ended 23 April 2015 by 44 and multiplying it by 52.

Annualised Adjusted EBITDA for financial year 2015 was £186.1 million, resulting in an Annualised Adjusted
EBITDA margin of 48.1%.

The following table provides a reconciliation of Annualised Adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and
Profit for the period, in each case on a pro forma combined basis for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2015. See also “Unaudited

(a) Center Parcs defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to remove the effects of owners’ costs and certain exceptional and nonunderlying items that Center Parcs believes are not indicative of its underlying operating performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and
Annualised Adjusted EBITDA are not measures under IFRS and investors should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as
alternatives to (a) operating profit or profit/(loss) for the period as a measure of Center Parcs’ operating performance, (b) cash flows
from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of Center Parcs’ ability to meet its cash needs or (c) any other measures
of performance under IFRS. Investors should evaluate each adjustment and the reasons Center Parcs considers it appropriate as a method
of supplemental analysis. In evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualised Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that,
as an analytical tool, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualised Adjusted EBITDA are each subject to certain limitations. See
“Presentation of Financial Information — Non-IFRS Financial Measures”. In addition, investors should be aware that Center Parcs is
likely to incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation in the future and that certain of these items could be considered
recurring in nature. Center Parcs’ presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Annualised Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an
inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. For further information, see the discussions on
exceptional items in the Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Offering
Circular.

(b) Exceptional and non-underlying items comprise Woburn pre-opening losses and other exceptional and non-underlying items. Woburn
pre-opening losses relate to losses of £3.6 million incurred during the 8 weeks ended 19 June 2014 in respect of Woburn Village.
Woburn opened to guests on 6 June 2014, but did not operate at full capacity until after 19 June 2014. Other exceptional and nonunderlying items relate to £6.3 million of costs incurred in respect of the Blackstone Funds’ exit from Center Parcs.

(c) Owners’ costs comprise of management charges payable to the Blackstone Funds and associated entities prior to their exit from Center
Parcs.

(d) Run Rate Impact represents the adjustment required to show the full 52-week impact of the Woburn Acquisition and Accession. It
represents £5.9 million of additional Adjusted EBITDA to show the full year impact of the opening of Woburn. It was calculated by
dividing Woburn’s Adjusted EBITDA of £32.5 million for the 44 weeks ended 23 April 2015 by 44 and multiplying it by 52.

(1) Exceptional and non-underlying items comprise Woburn pre-opening losses and other exceptional and non-underlying items. Woburn
pre-opening losses relate to losses incurred during the 8 weeks ended 19 June 2014 in respect of Woburn Village. Woburn opened to
guests on 6 June 2014, but did not operate at full capacity until after 19 June 2014. Other exceptional and non-underlying items of
Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited relate to £6.3 million of exceptional administrative expenses incurred in respect of the Blackstone
Funds’ exit from Center Parcs in financial year 2015.

(2) Cost of sales and administrative expenses for the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2014 have been restated in the audited consolidated financial
statements for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2015 in order to more accurately reflect the nature of expenses incurred by Center Parcs
(Holdings 1) Limited. Costs of £53.0 million have been transferred from Administrative expense to Cost of sales, principally in respect
of payroll costs. This restatement has no impact on Adjusted EBITDA or Operating profit.

Cost of sales and administrative expenses for the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2013 have been restated throughout this Offering Circular
from the audited consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited for the same period in order to present the
financial information on a consistent basis across the historical financial periods.

Class A Notes Refinancing.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Offered Notes involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the following_
_risk factors and the other information contained in this Offering Circular before making an investment decision. The risks_
_described below are not the only ones the Center Parcs Group faces. Additional risks not presently known to the Center Parcs_
_Group or that it currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. If any such risks or any other_
_matters or unforeseen events actually occur, Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations could be_
_materially adversely affected. In any of such cases, the value of the Offered Notes could decline, and the Center Parcs Group_
_may not be able to pay all or part of the interest or principal on the Offered Notes and investors may lose all or part of their_
_investment. This Offering Circular also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Center_
_Parcs Group’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of_
_certain factors, including the risks faced by the Center Parcs Group described below and elsewhere in this Offering Circular._
_See “Forward-Looking Statements”._

**RISKS RELATING TO CENTER PARCS’ BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY**

**_Center Parcs derives its revenue from operating its villages. Any failure to manage its villages effectively or any significant_**
**_business interruption or other event affecting the operation of one or more of its villages may have a material adverse_**
**_effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Center Parcs currently operates five holiday villages in England. Any significant business interruption at any of its
villages may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ financial condition and results of operations. Although Center
Parcs has risk management arrangements, including business continuity plans in place, such risk management arrangements,
or any insurance may not adequately protect Center Parcs from significant interruption of business at any one or more of the
villages. In addition, Center Parcs may not be able to obtain planning permission or planning consent to rebuild properties if
destroyed, regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds. A significant interruption or event could be created by any
number of internal or external factors, including fire (as occurred at the Elveden village in 2002, resulting in a 15-month
closure), extreme weather conditions, accidents, loss of utilities or other interruptions. Due to the full service, self-contained
nature of its villages, Center Parcs maintains significant infrastructure, including water supply, electricity and waste water
treatment, and any failure to adequately develop and maintain these facilities could also result in a significant business
interruption. Such interruptions and events may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition
and results of operations.

In addition, Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely
affected by a number of factors relating to the operation of any village or the guest perception or expectation of the operating
activities in a particular village. Factors that relate specifically to a particular village could include, amongst others:

      - the age, design, construction quality and maintenance of the village;

      - perceptions regarding the attractiveness of the village;

      - the proximity and attractiveness of competing UK holiday centres;

      - the proximity of other developments and infrastructure projects, for example, power stations or road projects,
which adversely impacts guest experiences;

      - increases in operating expenses;

      - inability to pass on to guests any significant unforeseen input costs, such as utility costs, that would erode
Center Parcs’ margins;

      - an increase in the capital expenditure needed to maintain the village or make improvements, or to maintain the
competitiveness of the villages;

      - an outbreak of notifiable illness, food poisoning or drinking water contamination at any village;

      - major village damage or disruption including natural or environmental disasters;

      - bad or extreme weather conditions;

      - an illness, disease or event that damages the forest, fauna and natural environment surrounding a village;

      - guest health and safety issues, such as inadequate or untimely first aid responses, accidents, personal injuries or
child abuse or abduction;

      - a fluctuation or decline, seasonal or otherwise, in demand for the facilities that the village offers;

      - increases in development and construction costs or delays in completion schedules;

      - disturbances to guests’ experiences caused by new build, maintenance or refurbishment projects; and

      - negative publicity or guest perceptions about any village due to the above-mentioned factors or otherwise.

Center Parcs’ effective management and operation of the villages has a significant impact on the revenues, expenses
and value of the villages. Any failure to manage Center Parcs’ operations effectively, including any failure to anticipate and
react to the above-mentioned factors may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Center Parcs’ business depends on the public perception of its brand. Any event at any village negatively affecting guest_**
**_perception or expectation will likely negatively affect guest perception of the other Center Parcs villages._**

The success of Center Parcs’ business depends on the public perception of the Center Parcs brand. Any event or
occurrence at any one village that negatively affects guest perceptions is likely to negatively affect guest perceptions of the
other Center Parcs villages. Center Parcs villages feature attractions such as water activities, paintballing, laser combat, horse
riding, abseiling, zip wiring and quadbiking that pose a potential risk of accident and serious personal injury. If a serious
personal injury were to occur at one of the holiday villages, attendance at the holiday villages and, consequently, revenues
might be materially adversely affected. In addition, holidays at Center Parcs’ villages involve guest services and guest
interactions, including with respect to bookings, accommodation services, on-site activities and food and beverage provisions.
A pattern of poor or unsatisfactory guest service, guest complaints or poor reviews on social media at any of the villages could
result in reputational harm to the Center Parcs brand. Furthermore, certain animal rights activists are known to campaign
against certain organisations that may be guests at Center Parcs. If Center Parcs were to become the subject of such
campaigns, this could impact public opinion about or interfere with Center Parcs’ operations. The considerable expansion in
the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope and speed of the negative publicity that could be
generated by such incidents or events. Any accident, interruption, serious disturbance or negative publicity at Center Parcs’
holiday villages, or a perception that the facilities are unsafe or operate in an unsafe manner, may reduce attendance at or
demand for its holiday villages, which would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of
operations.

If any such accidents or injuries do occur, Center Parcs’ insurance may not adequately cover the costs stemming
from such accidents and injuries or other disturbances and incidents. Center Parcs could also face legal claims related to these
events, as well as adverse publicity that could be generated by such incidents. Accidents or injuries could also require
upgrades, modifications or demolition of affected facilities, which could result in significant costs to Center Parcs and disrupt
operations, which could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, Center Parcs sells food and beverages, toys and other retail products, the sale of which involves legal
and other risks. As a reseller of food and retail merchandise, Center Parcs may be liable if the consumption or purchase of any
of the products it sells causes illness or injury. Furthermore, any product recall could result in losses due to the cost of the
recall, the destruction of product and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. A significant food,
toy, gift or other retail product recall could also result in adverse publicity, damage to Center Parcs’ reputation and loss of
consumer confidence in its villages, which could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition
and results of operations.

Center Parcs targets affluent family-focused guests with approximately 77% of Center Parcs’ guests currently being
families with children. In order to provide an environment that is attractive to this core group of guests, Center Parcs strives to
maintain a balanced guest profile of, amongst others, families, adult groups and corporate events. If guests’ behaviour is
disruptive or otherwise affects the enjoyment of other guests, this could result in adverse publicity and damage to Center
Parcs’ reputation. A failure to attract Center Parcs’ core demographic of affluent guests with families could have a material
adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial conditions and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs’ business is currently located entirely in England. As a result, changes in the UK holiday market may have a_**
**_more significant adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations than on more_**
**_geographically diverse holiday businesses._**

Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations may be significantly adversely affected by a
number of factors that affect the UK holiday market, including:

      - national, regional or local economic conditions (including rates of pay and unemployment rates);

      - socioeconomic and demographic factors;

34


-----

      - consumer confidence and personal disposable income;

      - exchange rate fluctuations or other factors which impact tourism or travel to or within the UK;

      - significant increases in utility and fuel costs;

      - local holiday market conditions from time to time (such as an over-supply or under-supply of holiday resort
centre accommodation and facilities);

      - consumer tastes and preferences;

      - changes in governmental regulations, fiscal policy, planning/zoning or tax laws and building codes as well as
other regulatory changes;

      - changes in minimum wage legislation or other factors increasing operational costs;

      - potential environmental legislation or liabilities or other legal liabilities;

      - acts of terrorism, natural disasters and direct political action; or

      - instances of illness, an epidemic or a pandemic.

All Center Parcs’ villages are currently located in England and, consequently, the level of revenue and profit
generated by the villages could be substantially influenced by general economic conditions in the United Kingdom. While
Center Parcs’ revenues increased in each of financial years 2013, 2014 and 2015, such growth may not be sustained in future
periods and revenue may decline. The villages have certain fixed operating costs, and as a result decreases in revenue may
result in a significant decline in net cash flow. In addition, a significant or sustained decline in economic conditions or rates of
high inflation, including as a result of uncertainty in the Eurozone, could adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to obtain goods
and services from suppliers or credit from financing sources and could impact the ability of third parties, including insurance
carriers and credit providers, to meet their obligations to Center Parcs. Weak economic conditions generally in the United
Kingdom, or in any regional market from which a particular village attracts guests, may adversely affect holiday centre
occupancy, guest spending patterns and Center Parcs’ general business and financial condition. Conversely, if general
economic conditions in the United Kingdom were to improve significantly, there may be greater consumer preference for
holidays abroad.

The disposable income of Center Parcs’ guests and/or their holiday preferences may be affected by changes in the
general economic environment. Any decrease in disposable income of Center Parcs’ guests may result in a decline in the
number of guests and/or a decrease in on-site spending. Even if economic conditions are stable or improving, a negative
economic outlook, including the fear of another recession and/or concerns regarding falling living standards, may adversely
affect consumer spending and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Center Parcs relies on information technology in its operations and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or_**
**_breach of security of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate its business and subject it to data loss,_**
**_litigation, liability and reputational harm._**

Center Parcs relies on its information systems across its operations, such as in the processing of payment details,
and on those of its third parties service providers, including the online booking system provided by ATCORE (formerly
Anite) and its guest database provided by The Database Group. Its ability to effectively manage its business depends
significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. Extended or widespread outages of the online accommodation or
activities booking system (including the self-service booking points on-site) could adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to
take guest bookings.

The provision of convenient, trusted, fast and effective payment processing services to Center Parcs’ guests is
critical to its business. If there is any deterioration in the quality of the payment processing services provided to Center Parcs’
guests or any interruption to those services, or if such services are only available at an increased cost to Center Parcs or its
guests or are terminated and no timely and comparable replacement services are found, Center Parcs’ guests may be deterred
from booking Center Parcs breaks.

Center Parcs, and third party service providers on its behalf, collect, process and retain large volumes of guest data,
which, together with employee data and other confidential information, is entered into, processed, summarised and reported
by various information systems. Center Parcs also uses video surveillance in certain public areas for security purposes. The
footage from such surveillance is also subject to data protection and privacy laws.

Notwithstanding the efforts and technology of Center Parcs and its third party service providers to secure their
computer networks, the security of those networks could be compromised. Third parties may have the technology or knowhow to breach the security of Center Parcs’ guest, employee and other confidential information, and Center Parcs’ security

35


-----

measures (or those of its third party service providers) may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to
this information, destroying or stealing valuable information or disrupting Center Parcs’ operations. In addition, Center Parcs
or any of its third party service providers may lose data, including guest data and payment details, or may fail to transmit such
data online in a secure manner. In each case, if any theft or loss of personal guest data were to occur, Center Parcs could face
liability (including fines) under data protection or privacy laws and lose the goodwill of its guests, incurring significant
reputational harm. Such security breaches could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition
and results of operations.

If the guest, employee or other data held by Center Parcs is not accurate or complete, there is a risk that Center
Parcs could make incorrect decisions regarding marketing, pricing, cost management or other factors that impact its financial
performance.

Any virus, security breach, loss, or theft of company, guest or employee data could expose Center Parcs to adverse
publicity, loss of sales and profits, regulatory action, or cause Center Parcs to incur significant costs to reimburse third parties
for damages, which could impact its results of operations.

**_Center Parcs competes for discretionary spending with other holiday offerings and holiday or leisure alternatives._**

The UK domestic holiday market is diverse and largely unregulated. Center Parcs’ main competitors are high-end,
self-catering cottage accommodation and leisure hotels and resorts, primarily in the UK and to a lesser extent abroad. Center
Parcs’ holiday villages compete for guests’ discretionary spending with other holiday offerings, including other holiday
villages (both UK traditional holiday villages and holiday parks and UK and international destination parks). In addition,
while at present there is only one other forest village holiday provider in the UK, other holiday providers could open forest
villages in the UK in the future. A village’s ability to attract guests depends, among other things, on the quality of the
accommodation, competitiveness of prices, amenities and facilities offered and the convenience and location of the village. If
competing UK holiday centres provide a better offering to guests, this may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’
business, financial condition and results of operations, which may in turn affect the ability of the Obligors to meet their
obligations under the loans and the Issuer’s ability to meet its obligations under the Notes.

Since the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two hour drive of the village they choose to visit, the effects
of competition would be more pronounced if a new holiday centre or other guest attraction opened within close proximity to
one of Center Parcs’ holiday villages or if an existing holiday centre expanded into its market or began conducting activities
aimed at capturing Center Parcs’ market share.

In addition, Center Parcs may face increased competition from holiday offerings outside the UK as a result of an
increase in the convenience or reduction in the cost of air travel, particularly due to the decline in global oil prices,
appreciation of the pound relative to other currencies, particularly the euro, or inclement weather in the UK. In addition, as
macroeconomic conditions are expected to recover and inflation in the UK declines, there may be greater consumer
preference for holidays abroad.

Center Parcs also competes more broadly with other types of leisure activities and forms of entertainment, such as
sports and other recreational activities, restaurants, bars, retail outlets and spa facilities.

One or more of Center Parcs’ competitors for holiday or leisure activities may be more successful in attracting and
retaining guests. If Center Parcs does not compete successfully for discretionary spending with other holiday villages and
other leisure alternatives, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

**_Center Parcs could be adversely affected by changes in consumer tastes and expectations or its failure to maintain and_**
**_improve its villages and amenities to appeal to changing guest tastes and expectations._**

The success of Center Parcs’ holiday villages depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that can
change in unpredictable ways, and on Center Parcs’ ability to ensure that its holiday villages meet the changing preferences of
its target guests. Rising standards of accommodation and amenities and higher guest expectations may also affect the revenues
and popularity of Center Parcs’ villages, which require continued investment to ensure that the accommodation and amenities
in the villages are attractive and appeal to Center Parcs’ guests. Center Parcs carries out significant research and analysis
before constructing new holiday villages or opening new facilities at its villages and often invests substantial amounts in
investigating how these new holiday villages and new facilities may be perceived by guests. If Center Parcs’ facilities or new
entertainment and leisure activity offerings do not achieve targeted guest volumes, revenues may decline. Any failure to
invest, innovate or continue to improve Center Parcs’ offering in a timely manner to meet changing consumer preferences or
to retain long-term guest loyalty or provide satisfactory guest service may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’
business, financial condition and result of operations.

**_Bad or extreme weather conditions, road, rail or other transportation disruptions or closures and other conditions out of_**
**_Center Parcs’ control could negatively affect occupancy at Center Parcs’ villages._**

Center Parcs’ holiday villages provide both indoor and outdoor activities, with the natural setting of the villages and
the outdoor activities a major draw for guests. Bad weather or forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions can reduce the

36


-----

number of people who come to the holiday villages or who book stays, which may require Center Parcs to lower prices thus
reducing ADR even if occupancy remains stable. In addition, due to the often unexpected nature of bad or extreme weather
conditions, Center Parcs may fail to predict or undertake the appropriate advanced planning to maintain business operations in
the event of a disruption due to bad or extreme weather conditions. Any such condition could also adversely affect guests’
experiences during their stay at Center Parcs and thereby affect their willingness to return to Center Parcs as repeat guests.
Bad or extreme weather conditions (for example, floods, storms or high winds) or other occurrences outside of Center Parcs’
control (such as fires) could also lead to the loss of use of one or more of Center Parcs’ villages, or damage the natural
environment in which the villages are situated, and disrupt its ability to attract guests to certain of Center Parcs’ villages or
facilities.

The occurrence of extreme winter weather conditions could cause significant damage to Center Parcs’ holiday
villages, which could materially and adversely affect its overall business. Similarly, unseasonably high temperatures and high
winds could exacerbate forest fires. In addition, prolonged drought conditions may cause water shortages, which could
adversely impact the operation of Center Parcs’ water amenities. Center Parcs’ insurance may not be sufficient to cover the
costs of repairing or replacing damaged property or equipment, and Center Parcs may suffer a significant decline in revenues
if any of its holiday villages is closed or unable to operate all of its facilities for an extended period of time.

Road closures or detours as a result of bad weather conditions may also prevent or delay Center Parcs’ guests, who
primarily drive to the villages, from reaching the villages. Road closures and detours have the potential of extending the
effects of bad weather beyond the particular storm or weather condition as damaged roads and highways may take significant
time to repair. Additionally, road closures and detours as a result of non-weather factors, such as government repair works,
may also reduce the number of guests.

In addition, if transport links to Center Parcs’ holiday villages and related infrastructure are damaged or become
inadequate, guests may face difficulty in traveling to the villages, or may face significant delays and increased travel times,
which could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs’ revenues are highest during school holidays and public holidays, which could magnify the impact of adverse_**
**_conditions or events that occur during peak demand periods._**

Center Parcs’ revenues are subject to seasonal factors and guest demand for breaks increases during school
holidays, public holidays and periods of expected favourable weather conditions, among other things, during which Center
Parcs is generally able to charge higher prices. As a result, if extreme weather, accidents or other adverse conditions or events
occur, particularly during peak holiday periods, Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations may be
materially adversely affected. Additionally, changes in school holiday schedules or a switch to a uniform year-round schedule
could adversely affect Center Parcs’ guest bookings, and consequently its attendance levels or target pricing levels during the
peak holiday periods, which may adversely affect Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, any such adverse effect or condition may make it difficult for Center Parcs to predict its operating results, which
may materially and adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to implement planned capital expenditures.

**_Instances of illness or epidemics, as well as negative publicity relating thereto, could result in reduced guest attendance_**
**_and materially and adversely impact Center Parcs’ business._**

Instances of illness or injury in general or claims of illness relating to food or drinking water quality or handling at
restaurants, food preparation centres or holiday centres, whether or not affecting Center Parcs’ villages, or in relation to water
quality within pools and spas could reduce guest attendance materially, either through cancellations of existing bookings or by
reducing consumer willingness to visit Center Parcs. In addition, any negative publicity relating to these and other healthrelated matters might affect consumers’ perceptions of Center Parcs’ holiday villages and reduce guest visits to its holiday
villages.

The outbreak of a prolonged pandemic or epidemic disease or the occurrence of any other public health concern
could negatively impact the public’s willingness to gather in public spaces or travel or result in health or other government
authorities imposing restrictions on travel, which individually or together could reduce guest volumes or revenues at Center
Parcs’ holiday villages. In addition, any such public health concerns may severely restrict the level of economic activity in
affected areas. Any of these events, particularly if they occur during the peak holiday periods, or the booking periods thereof,
could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs’ insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that it could suffer, and its insurance_**
**_costs may increase._**

Companies engaged in the holiday centre business may be sued for substantial damages in the event of an actual or
alleged accident. A catastrophic loss or accident occurring at Center Parcs’ holiday villages or at competing holiday villages
may increase insurance premiums, and negatively impact Center Parcs’ operating results. Although Center Parcs carries
annual liability insurance to cover this risk, its coverage may not be adequate to cover liabilities, and it may not be able to
obtain adequate coverage should a catastrophic incident occur.

37


-----

Center Parcs utilises a combination of self-insurance (through the use of large excesses payable by Center Parcs)
and insurance coverage programmes for property, business interruption, employer’s liability, public/products liability and
health care insurance. Pursuant to such programmes, Center Parcs is responsible for a specified amount of claims and insures
for claims above such limits.

Potential liabilities that Center Parcs self-insures or buys commercial insurance for could increase in the future. In
addition, insurance may not be available to Center Parcs on commercially acceptable terms or at all, or Center Parcs could
experience increases in the cost of such insurance. Any increase in the number of claims or amount per claim or increase in
the cost of insurance could materially and adversely affect Center Parcs’ results of operations.

The Obligors are required by the terms of the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements to insure the villages against the
risk of material damage or destruction and resulting business interruption, acts of terrorism, public and product liabilities and
such other risks as a prudent owner and operator of similar properties would insure against.

The Obligors have granted security to the Borrower Security Trustee under the terms of the Borrower Deed of
Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge for amounts which are or may become payable under all of its insurance policies
relating to material damage or destruction and resulting business interruption taken out by the relevant Obligor in respect of
the relevant village.

A failure by any of the Obligors to renew the relevant insurance policies in respect of a village may, upon damage to
the village or loss of revenue in respect to the village (which would otherwise have been recoverable under such insurance
policy), result in a corresponding loss in the value of such village or payment recovery under the loan made to the relevant
Borrower. Similarly, even where the relevant insurance policy is current, there could be an administrative delay in the receipt
of payment by the Obligors from the insurers which could affect the ability of the Obligors to meet their respective payment
obligations during that period of delay.

Certain types of risks and losses (such as losses resulting from war, terrorism, nuclear radiation, radioactive
contamination and heaving or settling of structures) may be or become either uninsurable or uneconomical to insure or may
not be covered by the relevant insurance policies. Other risks might become uninsurable (or uneconomical to insure) in the
future. The occurrence of significant uninsured or uninsurable losses could materially and adversely affect the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations, which could result in the Obligors not having sufficient funds to repay
in full amounts owing under or in respect of the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements.

**_Any adverse impact on guest perceptions of Center Parcs Holding B.V. or Center Parcs Europe N.V., with whom Center_**
**_Parcs shares its brand, could adversely affect Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations._**

The successor to the founder of the Center Parcs brand is Center Parcs Holding B.V., a subsidiary of French listed
company Pierre & Vacances, which operates a holiday business in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Under the
terms of a brand sharing agreement relating to trademarks and marketing services with, among others, CP Opco, Center Parcs
Holding B.V. and Center Parcs Europe N.V. (“CP Continental Europe”), the parties agreed that CP Opco is exclusively
entitled to use the trademark registrations for the Center Parcs brand that it owns in its territory (UK, the Channel Islands and
the Republic of Ireland) and CP Continental Europe is exclusively entitled to use the trademark registrations for the Center
Parcs brand that it owns in its territory (Albania, Austria, the Benelux, Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech
Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein,
Lithuania, Macedonia, Monaco, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland and Ukraine). Under the brand sharing agreement, each party has exclusive rights to operate holiday centres in its
respective territory using its registered marks.

CP Continental Europe’s parent company, Pierre & Vacances, has announced plans to develop tourism sites in
China inspired by the Center Parcs concept, in addition to expanding its offerings in France. With respect to the China sites,
under the brand sharing agreement, CP Continental Europe is required to invite Center Parcs to participate in all aspects of the
development if it wishes to use the Center Parcs name or other related trademarks. If Center Parcs does not accept the
invitation, CP Continental Europe would have the exclusive right to open and operate holiday centres in China under the
Center Parcs brand.

Any event or circumstance that has an adverse impact on guest perceptions of the Center Parcs brand and holiday
business outside the UK, the Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland could have a material adverse effect on the
reputation of the Center Parcs brand in the UK.

**_Center Parcs’ future performance depends on continued maintenance capital expenditure and investment capital_**
**_expenditure, which may be significant. Any failure to make the requisite maintenance capital expenditure or investment_**
**_capital expenditure in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition_**
**_and results of operations._**

Center Parcs’ future performance depends on making continued maintenance capital expenditure and investment
capital expenditure, which may be significant. A principal competitive factor for a holiday village is the uniqueness and

38


-----

perceived quality of its accommodation, amenities and facilities. Accordingly, the regular addition of new or improved
accommodation, amenities and facilities and the repair or maintenance of those in existence are key to the continued
competitiveness of Center Parcs’ holiday villages.

Maintenance capital expenditures include refurbishments to existing facilities, including ensuring health and safety
standards are met. Although the Obligors are required under the terms of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement to
spend a minimum of £18.5 million per year on maintenance capital expenditure, there can be no assurance that this amount
will be sufficient for Center Parcs’ requirements. Center Parcs’ maintenance capital expenditure for the Original Villages for
the 52-week period ended 24 April 2014 and the 52-week period ended 23 April 2015 was approximately £22.2 million and
£21 million, respectively.

Investment capital expenditures include building new accommodation, upgrading existing accommodation and
adding, upgrading or expanding cafes, restaurants and other facilities. Center Parcs’ investment capital expenditure for the
Original Villages for the 52-week period ended 24 April 2014 and the 52-week period ended 23 April 2015, were £19 million
and £18.6 million, respectively. To date, Center Parcs’ current investment capital expenditure programme to upgrade its
accommodation across its villages, which commenced in 2007, has resulted in an upgrade of approximately 84% of its total
accommodation stock at the Original Villages, with the remainder expected to be upgraded in the near to medium term.
Historical and future investment capital expenditure may not yield the anticipated revenue or ADR growth or improve the
attractiveness of Center Parcs’ holiday villages. Even if revenues do increase, the additional revenues may not be sufficient to
recover the amounts invested by Center Parcs and to provide a return on such investments. In addition, if Center Parcs does
not have sufficient liquidity to finance these upgrades or if insufficient amounts are spent on capital expenditure on the
villages, Center Parcs’ villages may not remain competitive.

There could be a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations if it
fails to maintain the planned approach to its maintenance and investment cycle and/or if any investment that does not result in
revenue growth does not otherwise recover the amount invested or does not maintain the long-term attractiveness or good and
safe condition of the relevant holiday village. Moreover, delays in the addition of new or improved accommodation, amenities
and facilities or the closure of any of its amenities and facilities for repairs could adversely affect occupancy levels and Center
Parcs’ ability to realise revenue growth, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Failure to keep pace with developments in technology or any problems with maintaining or implementing upgrades to_**
**_Center Parcs’ IT systems could impair Center Parcs’ operations or competitive position._**

The holiday centre industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems, including those
systems and technologies used for Center Parcs’ bookings, revenue management and property management platforms. These
technologies and systems must be refined, updated and/or replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis. If Center
Parcs is unable to do so as quickly as its competitors, within budget cost and time frames or at all, its business could suffer.
Center Parcs is in the process of introducing new IT systems and technologies aimed at improving pricing for bookings,
targeting new and repeat customers and strengthening and integrating customer relationship management processes. Any
problems with transitioning to or integrating its new systems could adversely affect Center Parcs’ business. In particular, the
implementation of the new IT systems could take longer than expected, disrupt Center Parcs’ current systems and/or result in
cost overruns. Center Parcs also may not achieve the benefits that it anticipates from these systems or any other new
technology or system in the future. If any of these risks were to be realised, this could have a material adverse effect on Center
Parcs’ business, financial conditions and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs may not realise all of the anticipated benefits of Woburn Village._**

Woburn Village opened to guests on 6 June 2014. Given the short period since it opened, there is limited historical
information upon which to evaluate its performance. There is therefore no assurance that Woburn Village will be able to
accomplish its business objectives, that it will continue to achieves its objectives or that it will be able to continue to operate
profitably. Woburn Village is located within a 90-minute drive of London households and, although this area covers a largely
untapped market for Center Parcs, a significant proportion of households that fall within a 2.5 hour estimated drive of Woburn
Village also fall into the catchment areas of one or more of the Original Villages, creating a risk that some guests who may
have visited one of the Original Villages may choose to visit Woburn instead. Since Woburn Village opened to guests, Center
Parcs has maintained high levels of occupancy at all five villages. However, in line with Center Parcs’ expectations, the
Woburn Village opening has had a modest impact on accommodation revenue at the Original Villages, with a lower level of
increase in ADR than in previous years. This has mainly been the case for the southern villages Elveden and Longleat. If
Woburn Village attracts guests away from Center Parcs’ Original Villages who are not replaced by new guests instead of
developing its own guest base, this could have a material adverse impact on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Center Parcs may not be able to successfully develop new villages and it may not realise desired returns from new villages_**
**_or other villages it may acquire._**

Center Parcs may not be able to successfully identify and secure suitable locations for new villages to develop or
acquire or may not be able to successfully execute opening such villages.

39


-----

New villages may fail to become operational on a timely basis or at all due to setbacks including but not limited to
delays or failure to receive planning permissions or other consents, inability to meet development requests from local
authorities, infrastructure issues, construction delays, inadequate or delayed financing, the delay or inability to recruit or
manage appropriately skilled employees or the inability to identify or secure agreements with key suppliers or development
partners. Furthermore, once opened, new villages may not attract anticipated volumes of guests, either in the short or
long term, as a result of differing customer expectations and preferences in these new locations or due to other factors.

The integration of a new village is a complex and time-consuming process. Center Parcs may not be able to
integrate effectively any village it develops or acquires or successfully implement appropriate operational, financial and
management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from such developments or acquisitions.
Center Parcs may also be subject to unexpected claims and liabilities arising from such developments or acquisitions. These
claims and liabilities could be costly to defend, could be material to its financial position and might exceed either the
limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of the indemnifying parties. The diversion
of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of the businesses
Center Parcs develops or acquires could negatively impact its business and results of operations. Further, the benefits that it
anticipates from these new developments or acquisitions may not be realised.

Any expansion into a new country would result in Center Parcs being subject to the laws and regulations of that
country. As a result, Center Parcs’ risk exposure to political and regulatory changes will increase as a result of opening a
village in another country. The impact of, and costs associated with, complying with changes in interpretation of existing, or
the adoption of new, legislation, regulations or other laws or licensing and authorisation regimes in the jurisdictions in which
Center Parcs has plans to operate can be difficult to anticipate or estimate and could have a material adverse effect on Center
Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations. Expansion into a new country could also subject Center Parcs to
risks related to adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Additionally, if Center Parcs wishes to use the Center Parcs brand for a village located outside of the
United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland, it must invite CP Continental Europe to participate in all
aspects of the development, funding, ownership and future management of such village. If CP Continental Europe accepts the
invitation, Center Parcs and CP Continental Europe would have to participate in the development and management of the
village on terms identical to each other. As a result, Center Parcs may not be able to effectively integrate such village into its
existing business structure, which may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and
results of operations.

The occurrence of any of these factors could negatively impact the ability of Center Parcs to generate the desired
returns from its strategy of international expansion, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Class B2 Noteholders will not have recourse to any additional village outside the United Kingdom, its assets, revenues or_**
**_cash flow while the Class A Notes are outstanding. Development of any such village may divert management’s time from_**
**_villages in the United Kingdom._**

The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement permits management to devote up to 25% of its time towards any
additional villages located outside the United Kingdom and does not require any additional Center Parcs villages that may be
developed outside the United Kingdom to accede to the Obligor Group (as is the case for any additional villages in the
United Kingdom). Center Parcs currently plans to open its first village outside of the United Kingdom in Ireland. Subject to
obtaining planning permission, financing and other relevant consents and approvals, Center Parcs currently expects the new
village in Ireland to open in 2019. Under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, none of the Obligors will own assets
relating to, or derive revenues from, a village in Ireland or any other additional village outside the United Kingdom. Unless an
additional village accedes to the Obligor Group, Class B2 Noteholders will not have recourse to any such village outside the
United Kingdom, its assets, revenues or cash flow. In addition, the development of additional villages outside the
United Kingdom could divert management’s time from the five existing villages or from any additional villages in the
United Kingdom and may impose additional burdens on Center Parcs’ limited management resources. This could have a
material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ financial condition, results of operations and business.

**_Center Parcs’ business could be harmed if it loses the services of its key management personnel or is unable to attract and_**
**_retain qualified employees._**

Center Parcs’ business depends upon the efforts and dedication of its senior management team and its staff, both in
the villages and at its head office. Competition for highly-qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of the services of any of
these key personnel without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material
adverse effect on investor confidence and on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
its success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees to keep pace with its needs. If Center
Parcs is unable to do so, its results of operations may be adversely affected.

In addition, Center Parcs’ future business success depends in part on its ability to continue to recruit, train, motivate
and retain employees and on its ability to continue to employ creative employees and consultants. The loss of service of any

40


-----

key personnel, or an inability to attract and retain qualified employees and consultants, could have a material adverse impact
on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs depends on third party suppliers and contractors._**

Center Parcs has key contractual relationships with a number of third parties, including suppliers, insurers, partners,
banks and payment processors. In particular, Center Parcs relies on key suppliers to carry on its operations. These include
Casual Dining Group (formerly Tragus), whose offering includes Café Rouge and Bella Italia; Select Service Partners
(“SSP”), whose offering includes gastro pub and fast food outlets; and the Nuance Group, Center Parcs’ retail partner. The
Center Parcs business model incorporates a range of service relationships, with some food and beverage and retail offerings
operated on a concession basis, others, such as Starbucks, being licensed to Center Parcs and some “back-of-house” services
provided by third parties, including laundry services and food and beverage supplies. Center Parcs also relies on third party
service providers and IT systems such as payment processing services and ATCORE (formerly Anite), a non-affiliated third
party company, which provides TourRes, the booking system used by Center Parcs.

The failure of one or more of the third party suppliers and contractors to deliver or provide the services when
needed by Center Parcs or at the desired quality may have an adverse impact on Center Parcs’ operations and business.
Similarly, the failure of one or more of these third parties to fulfil its obligations to Center Parcs for any other reason, or the
termination of such agreements by any of the third party suppliers or contractors, may also cause significant disruption and
have a material adverse effect on its result of operations, financial performance and prospects.

Furthermore, third party suppliers may seek to increase prices for their services. If Center Parcs is unable to
negotiate limits to any price increases or find alternative third party suppliers providing services at lower prices, such
increases may negatively impact Center Parcs’ business. In addition, material disputes may arise between Center Parcs and
third party service providers and suppliers, which could adversely affect the relationship between Center Parcs and such third
parties. Any or all such developments could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_The operation and development of Center Parcs’ holiday villages are subject to planning and other consents, laws and_**
**_regulations, which may constrain future development or new attractions. In addition, changes in use or planning consents_**
**_relating to property neighbouring the villages may have a material detrimental effect on guests’ enjoyment of the villages._**

Center Parcs’ villages are required to be constructed in accordance with the relevant planning permission to ensure
that the current use of the holiday villages is a lawful one. If the construction or use of a holiday village is not in accordance
with the relevant planning permission, the council may, in certain circumstances, require that use to cease. Further, a council
can require compliance with the conditions of any planning permission or planning agreement, or, in certain circumstances,
the alteration or reinstatement of any construction carried out without planning permission.

All of Center Parcs’ villages are in rural locations. Center Parcs may experience material difficulties or failures in
obtaining or renewing the necessary licences or approvals for its holiday villages, which could delay planned holiday centre
openings or result in holiday centre or attraction closures or fines. Stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with
respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could also delay or prevent development of new holiday villages in
particular locations. In the future, obtaining planning permission for future developments or new attractions may be difficult.
In addition, if any such planning permissions cannot be obtained, there are limited alternative uses for rural sites of the size of
the villages where base land values are low and alternative planning permissions are unlikely.

The operation, development and redevelopment of recreational facilities and other structures at Center Parcs’
holiday villages and the development of new or additional villages may require consent from the relevant local planning
authorities as well as from third parties, such as landlords, development partners, finance providers and regulatory bodies.
Center Parcs may not be able to obtain the requisite planning or other consents as and when required in respect of
developments or redevelopments or the roll-out of new or additional holiday villages, and planning or other consents may be
withdrawn in relation to existing offerings at any of its holiday villages. In addition, our properties may be subject to certain
restrictive covenants in favour of third parties.

In particular, Center Parcs currently plans to build around 100 new premium lodges at Woburn Village and around
100 new premium lodges and one-bedroom apartments at the Original Villages. Center Parcs only has planning permission for
approximately two-thirds of the new premium lodges at Woburn Village and approximately a quarter of the new builds
planned for the Original Villages. If Center Parcs is unable to obtain the requisite planning permissions for these additional
lodges at the existing villages, it would be unable to construct these additional lodges, which would have an adverse effect on
Center Parcs’ expansion plans for these sites.

Center Parcs works with and engages its local planning authorities with regard to issues of shared concern that
impact the development and redevelopment of its properties and the roll-out of new holiday villages, including sensitivities to
site noise, listed structures, road congestion and other traffic issues, and health and safety issues. If it were to fail to cooperate

41


-----

with local planning authorities or if Center Parcs’ work relationship with such authorities were to be adversely affected for
any reason, this could negatively impact its ability to obtain the planning and other consents necessary for the development
and redevelopment of current villages or expanding into new villages, or it could result in the withdrawal of existing consents.
Additionally, possible changes to planning rules (such as the categorisation of flood zones), or by-law distances which
prohibit development within a certain distance of flood defence structures) would, if made, adversely affect Center Parcs’
ability to develop a holiday village. Additional constraints on future development could have an adverse effect on guest
numbers, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.

Any refusal to grant, or delay in granting Center Parcs’ requested planning or other consents, or the application of
any special conditions to such consents (or breach by Center Parcs of such conditions), could have a material adverse effect
on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, future planning consents are likely to impose
further conditions and/or require Center Parcs to enter into new planning agreements. In addition, proposed regeneration
schemes may adversely impact guest access to, or the operation of, individual facilities. The constraints placed on Center
Parcs’ operations by future planning consents or regeneration schemes may be more onerous than those currently applying,
and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in use or planning consents relating to property neighbouring the villages may have a material detrimental
effect on guests’ enjoyment of the villages. For example, changes in use or planning consents could permit owners or
occupiers of property adjoining or close to Center Parcs’ villages to use their property in a way that disturbs or diminishes
guests’ enjoyment of the villages or the natural setting in which the villages are located. These uses would include the
installation or use of plant and equipment (e.g. electricity pylons) or activities that emit noise or smell, or that are inconsistent
with guests’ enjoyment of a holiday in a natural environment. Any such detrimental change, or negative publicity regarding
such a change, may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs may be subject to liabilities and costs associated with its intellectual property._**

Center Parcs relies on trademarks to protect its brand. Many of these trademarks have been a key part of
establishing its business in the UK holiday market, including Center Parcs and Aqua Sana. Center Parcs believes these
trademarks have significant value and are important to the marketing of its villages. The steps Center Parcs has taken or will
take to protect its proprietary trademark rights may not provide adequate protection, and Center Parcs may not have adequate
resources to enforce its trademarks if third parties infringe its trademarks. In addition, although Center Parcs owns its
trademarks, these trademarks may infringe the proprietary rights of others and may not be upheld if challenged. If its
trademarks infringe the rights of others, Center Parcs may be prevented from using its trademarks, any of which occurrences
could harm its business. In any such event, Center Parcs could be forced to rebrand its products and services, which could
result in loss of brand recognition and may require Center Parcs to devote significant resources to advertising and marketing
new brands. Further, any claims of trademark infringement may require Center Parcs to enter into a royalty or licensing
agreement to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property, which may not be available on terms acceptable to
Center Parcs.

From time to time, Center Parcs enters into agreements with third parties that permit it to use the intellectual
property of such third parties at its holiday villages. The third parties owning such intellectual property may not renew such
agreements with Center Parcs or may increase the cost for it to use such intellectual property to levels that make it cost
prohibitive or economically unfavourable for it to continue such arrangements.

**_Potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect Center Parcs’ business._**

From time to time, Center Parcs may become involved in litigation and regulatory actions as part of its ordinary
course of business. There is no guarantee that it will be successful in defending against civil suits or regulatory actions, such
as matters related to public and employee safety, food safety, employment and environmental laws and regulations. Even if a
civil litigation claim or regulatory investigation or claim is meritless, does not prevail or is not pursued, any negative publicity
surrounding assertions against Center Parcs’ holiday villages could adversely affect its reputation. Regardless of their
outcome, litigation and regulatory actions may result in substantial costs and expenses and divert the attention of Center
Parcs’ management. In addition to pending matters, future litigation, government proceedings, labour disputes or
environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of Center Parcs’ normal business operations, which may
have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Changes in privacy or data protection laws could adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to market its products effectively._**

Center Parcs’ holiday villages rely on its guest base and a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email
marketing. Any expansion of existing, and/or implementation of new, laws and regulations regarding marketing, solicitation,
privacy or data protection could adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to utilise its guest database for email and other
marketing techniques and could result in changes to its marketing strategy. If this occurs, Center Parcs may not be able to
develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could materially adversely impact its attendance levels and revenues.

**_Center Parcs may be adversely affected by environmental requirements and liabilities._**

Center Parcs is subject to extensive and frequently changing national and local environmental laws and regulations,
including laws and regulations governing air and noise emissions; water use and wastewater and stormwater discharges; the

42


-----

maintenance of above-ground and underground storage tanks; the use, release, storage, disposal, handling and transportation
of, and exposure to, oil, chemicals and hazardous substances; energy usage and emissions; the management and disposal of
waste; and otherwise relating to health and safety and the protection of the environment, natural resources and the remediation
of contaminated soil and groundwater. The development and operation of Center Parcs’ facilities require various permits and
licences pursuant to environmental laws and regulations, which can result in challenges in the applications process, constraints
in on-site operations, and costs in compliance.

Center Parcs may be found to be in violation of some environmental regulations in the future. Violations of
environmental laws and regulations can lead to significant fines and penalties and requirements for rectification, which could
require expenditure, changes in site operations or temporary closures of all or part of the relevant holiday centre. Sanctions for
alleged or actual non-compliance with environmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’
business, financial condition and results of operations. Such laws and regulations can impose clean-up responsibility and
liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of contaminants. Historical land uses on parts of
the village sites, such as quarrying, timber treatment, an electrical substation, sewage discharge/treatment, and a small part of
the Whinfell site that is a registered landfill (which is now closed, but is relatively close to an off-site potable water
abstraction point), may have introduced pollution or contamination into the soil and/or groundwater in parts of the Center
Parcs village sites or may have migrated beyond the boundaries of these sites. Center Parcs is also subject to certain
contractual requirements relating to the environment and may incur liabilities arising from historical, existing and future
environmental contamination at properties it owns or operates now or in the future or has owned or operated in the past. The
presence of hazardous substances on a property or the failure to meet environmental regulatory requirements may cause
Center Parcs to incur substantial remediation or compliance costs or temporarily close the relevant holiday centre. In addition,
if hazardous substances are located on or released from any of its properties, Center Parcs could incur substantial liabilities
through a private party personal injury claim, a claim by an adjacent property owner for property damage or a claim by a
governmental entity for other damages, such as natural resource damages. Center Parcs is also required to purchase carbon
allowances annually commensurate with energy consumption (with allowance prices increasing each year), and to audit
energy use, both of which are subject to financial penalties for non-compliance.

Center Parcs may incur additional expenditure and other commercial and financial impacts to comply with existing
as well as new or revised environmental legislation and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or
more rigorous enforcement of such laws and regulations, as well as in connection with fulfilling contractual obligations,
which could have a material adverse impact on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations. A
conviction for an environment offence could also negatively affect Center Parcs’ ability to contract with certain third parties
in the future.

If an environmental liability arises in relation to any of the holiday villages and it is not remedied, or is not capable
of being remedied, this may adversely affect Center Parcs’ business or financial condition. This may be either because of cost
or value implications for Center Parcs and its properties or because of disruption to services provided at the relevant holiday
village.

**_Center Parcs may be unable to renew headleases at the end of their lease periods or obtain new leases on acceptable terms,_**
**_and the existing leases are subject to early termination risks._**

All of the properties save for Longleat and Woburn are, in whole or in part, owned by the Center Parcs Group on
headleases granted by third party landlords. The main part of the site at Longleat (the holiday village) together with an
ancillary part of the site are held by the Center Parcs Group on two underleases, the headlease being held by SPV2 Limited,
which is a subsidiary of the Center Parcs Group. The Center Parcs Group also holds a headlease of the outdoor activity centre
at Longleat known as Keeper’s Cottage. For the purposes of this Offering Circular, the two underleases and the headlease held
by the Center Pars Group in relation to Longleat are referred to as headleases. The Woburn headlease is held by CP Woburn
Opco.

The headleases for Elveden Forest and Sherwood Forest expire in 2999, the headleases for Longleat expire in 2073,
the headleases for Whinfell Forest expire in 2120 and the headlease for Woburn expires in 2109.

There is a risk that the landlord of the relevant property may terminate the headlease (or in the case of Longleat, the
superior landlord may forfeit the superior leases causing the two headleases to terminate) before the expiry of the contractual
term for failure to pay rent or other breach of tenant obligation.

The rent payable under each of the headleases for Whinfell Forest, Elveden Forest and Sherwood Forest is a
nominal sum. The yearly rent payable under the headleases for Longleat is currently £656,758 in aggregate subject to
upwards-only review every five years by reference to the historic increase in revenue at Longleat. The 2014 rent review
discussions in respect of Longleat have been agreed in principle, with the revised yearly rent payable under the headleases
agreed at £784,758. The rent review is subject to the signing of the relevant rent review memorandum with respect to each
lease. Center Parcs continues to pay rent at the level set at the previous rent review; the landlord is accepting the existing rent
pending the review and Center Parcs is accruing the amounts due following the rent review so that they are fully accounted

43


-----

for. The rent payable under the Woburn lease is currently £557,750 per annum subject to upwards only review every five
years (the next review date is in 2018) by reference to the greater of an increase in rent in line with the retail price index, a
fixed percentage increase in the passing rent or the historic increase in revenue at Woburn. Other tenant obligations in the
headleases include, but are not limited to, an obligation to keep the properties in good and substantial repair. Any early
termination, delay in or inability to renew Center Parcs’ existing leases may negatively impact its ability to operate its
villages.

Each Obligor has undertaken in the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements to pay, when due, all sums payable by it
under each headlease, to perform and observe all of its material covenants under each headlease and not to commit a material
breach of any headlease.

The headleases for Whinfell and Longleat do not contain mortgagee protection provisions in the event of forfeiture.
The Woburn headlease does contains mortgagee protection provisions and therefore, before the landlord can forfeit the
headlease, it is obliged to notify the mortgagee of its intention to do so, giving the mortgagee, within a period of three months,
the opportunity to i) enter into a deed of covenant with the landlord to comply with the tenant obligations in the lease or ii)
procure an assignment of the lease to a third party in accordance with the terms of the headlease. If a landlord were to seek to
forfeit a headlease, the Obligor owning the property and the Borrower Security Trustee would have a right to apply to the
English courts to seek relief from forfeiture. The headleases for Elveden and Sherwood contain a proviso in the forfeiture
clause that in the event of the landlord serving notice on the tenant alleging breach of any material covenant by the tenant, the
landlord must contemporaneously serve a copy of the notice on any mortgagee of which the landlord has notice and the
landlord must give not less than ten days’ prior notice to any mortgagee to exercise any right of re-entry.

**_Any property on which the villages are located may be subject to compulsory purchase._**

The only recent compulsory purchase order affecting any of the Center Parcs villages is a compulsory purchase
order in respect of Elveden relating to small parcels of land forming part of the road side verge next to the highway. An
amount of compensation will be payable to Center Parcs as a result. The compulsory purchase of this land does not have a
detrimental effect on the operation of Elveden Village and, given the size of land compulsorily purchased, the quantum of any
compensation will be nominal. However, any property in the United Kingdom may at any time be compulsorily acquired by a
public authority possessing compulsory purchase powers (for instance, local authorities and statutory undertakings (including
electricity, gas, water and railway undertakers) in respect of their statutory functions) if it can demonstrate that the acquisition
is required.

Any promoter of a compulsory purchaser order would need to demonstrate that compulsory purchase was necessary
or desirable for the promoter’s statutory functions and for, or in, the public interest. As a general rule, in the event of an order
being made in respect of all or any part of any holiday village, compensation would normally be payable on the basis that it be
broadly equivalent to the open market value of all owners’ and tenants’ proprietary interests in the portion of the village
subject to compulsory purchase at the time of the related purchase, so far as those interests are included in the order.
Compensation would normally be payable in respect of the land acquired and the diminution in value of any retained land,
reduction in rent and other adverse impacts of the compulsory purchase scheme.

There is often a delay between the compulsory purchase of a property and the payment of compensation, although
advance payment of compensation is available representing 90% of the amount of compensation which the acquiring authority
considers is due (where the acquiring authority takes possession before compensation has been agreed).

Compulsory purchase of all or any significant portion of property relating to the villages, or the payment of
compensation that does not reflect the value to Center Parcs of affected land, may have a material adverse effect on Center
Parcs’ financial condition and results of operations.

**_Governmental regulation may adversely affect Center Parcs’ existing and future operations and results._**

Center Parcs is subject to various national and local regulations that have affected, and will continue to affect, its
operations. Each of its holiday villages is subject to national and local licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, food and
workplace safety, and other agencies. Its operations are also subject to regulations which govern such matters as the minimum
wage, overtime and other working conditions, along with parental leave and a variety of similar laws enacted to govern these
and other employment law matters. Currently, Center Parcs pays a base rate that is higher than the existing national minimum
wage in the United Kingdom. However, Center Parcs’ results of operations may be impacted by the introduction in the 2015
UK budget of the national living wage for employees aged 25 and over from April 2016 and subsequent increases in the
national living wage over time together with increases in the current national minimum wage for those under the age of 25.
The introduction of the national living wage could also lead to wage inflation on a broader basis as employees who earn more
than the national living wage may seek higher pay increases to maintain a differential with the national living wage.

Center Parcs is also subject to the Equality Act 2010, which gives civil rights protections to individuals with
disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodation and other areas. Center Parcs may in the future have to

44


-----

modify its villages to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. The expenses associated
with these modifications could be material. Regulations and laws, or the way in which they are interpreted, may become more
stringent over time, which could require new capital expenditures and result in an increase in its operating costs.

**_Work stoppages, increased staff costs, and other employee problems could negatively impact Center Parcs’ future profits._**

A lengthy strike or other work stoppage at one of the holiday villages could have an adverse effect on Center Parcs’
business and results of operations. Center Parcs’ employees are not unionised, but some of Center Parcs’ employees are, or
may in the future be, represented by works councils. Center Parcs may experience union activity in the future which could
negatively impact Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, staff costs are a primary cost component in operating Center Parcs. Increased staff costs, due to
competition for available workers, increased minimum wage or employee benefit costs, changes in labour laws or otherwise,
could adversely impact Center Parcs’ operating expenses. For example, costs of medical benefits may increase significantly
due to regulations, macroeconomic conditions and other factors beyond Center Parcs’ control.

**_Acts of terrorism may negatively impact Center Parcs’ business._**

Terrorist attacks have created many economic and political uncertainties. Center Parcs cannot predict the extent to
which terrorism or security alerts may directly or indirectly impact demand for its holiday parks, or otherwise impact its
business and operating results. The occurrence of any such terrorist event near or at a village could have a material adverse
effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Class B2 Noteholders will have recourse to any additional villages that Center Parcs constructs or acquires in the United_**
**_Kingdom only if and when certain conditions under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement are satisfied following_**
**_completion of the development of such additional villages. These conditions may not be satisfied when expected, or at all._**

The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement provides that the Borrowers must use all reasonable endeavours to
procure the accession of the relevant additional village site in the United Kingdom within three years of either the acquisition
of the relevant additional village or the additional village becoming operational and starting to receive paying guests,
whichever is later. The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement further provides (among other things) that if the market
conditions are such that the accession of the relevant additional village to the Obligor Group would not be executable in a
“commercially reasonable manner (having regard to the then expected pricing for such acquisition)” then the Borrowers will
not be required to procure accession at that time but as soon as possible after that time. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness — Class A IBLA — Additional Site Entities”._

While the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement does not require the satisfaction of similar conditions, so long
as the Class A Notes are outstanding, the Class B2 Noteholders will not have recourse to any additional villages unless the
conditions under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement are satisfied. Accordingly, unless and until the accession
conditions are satisfied and any relevant additional village is transferred to the Obligor Group in accordance with the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement the business that supports interest and principal on the Notes may be negatively impacted
by any such additional village without receiving any benefits or income expected to be derived from the additional village.
Accordingly, development and operation of any additional village in the United Kingdom may materially and adversely affect
the Obligors’ financial condition, results of operations and the Obligors’ ability to pay interest and principal on the Notes.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE FINANCING STRUCTURE**

**_The Obligors’ ability to meet their obligations in respect of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will depend_**
**_primarily on the performance of their businesses and Center Parcs may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to_**
**_meet such obligations_**

The Obligors’ ability to meet their scheduled payment obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement will depend upon the financial condition and performance of the Center Parcs business as a whole and their
general financial condition and operating performance, which in turn will be affected by general economic conditions and by
financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond their control. The obligations of the Obligors to make payments
under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement are in each case full-recourse obligations and are not limited. Future
performance of Center Parcs’ business may not be similar to the performance results of operations of Opco and the Propcos to
date described in this Offering Circular.

Unless previously repaid in full, the Borrowers will be required to repay (i) the Class A Loans on the Class A2 Loan
Final Maturity Date (in respect of the Class A2 Loan), the Class A3 Loan Final Maturity Date (in respect of the Class A3
Loan) and the Class A4 Loan Final Maturity Date (in respect of the Class A4 Loan), respectively, and (ii) the Class B2 Loan
on the Class B2 Loan Final Maturity Date (together with the Class A2 Loan Final Maturity Date, the Class A3 Loan Final
Maturity Date and the Class A4 Loan Final Maturity Date, the “Loan Repayment Dates”).

45


-----

The ability of the Issuer to redeem the Class B2 Notes on the Class B2 Note Expected Maturity Date is dependent
on the repayment in full of the corresponding Class B2 Loan by the Borrowers. Center Parcs cannot assure holders that its
business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future sources of capital will be available to it in an amount
sufficient to enable the Obligors to service their indebtedness, including the Class B2 Loan, or to fund their other liquidity
needs.

Further, a failure to repay the Class B2 Loan on the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date will not constitute an
event of default but will only give rise to a Share Enforcement Event.

**_Center Parcs has significant leverage which could adversely affect its financial condition and its ability to service its_**
**_payment obligations under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements and therefore the ability of the Issuer to service its_**
**_payment obligations under the Notes including the Class B2 Notes._**

Center Parcs has consolidated indebtedness that is substantial in relation to its shareholders’ equity. After giving pro
forma effect to the Financing Transactions, Center Parcs’ pro forma combined total debt as at the Third Closing Date will
amount to approximately £1.49 billion. In addition, as stated in the risk factor above, Center Parcs may incur further
indebtedness under, or permitted by, the terms and conditions of the Class A Notes (the “Class A Conditions”), the terms and
conditions of the Class B Notes (the “Class B Conditions”) and the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements. Center Parcs’
relatively high level of debt could:

      - make it more difficult for Center Parcs to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements and ultimately for the Issuer to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Notes;

      - increase Center Parcs’ vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including rises in
interest rates;

      - restrict Center Parcs from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

      - along with the financial and other restrictive covenants under Center Parcs’ indebtedness, limit its ability to
obtain additional financing, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends other than as permitted in accordance with
the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements;

      - require Center Parcs to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to service its
indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund future working capital, capital
expenditures, other general corporate requirements and dividends;

      - require Center Parcs to sell or otherwise transfer assets used in its business in order to fund its debt service
obligations;

      - limit Center Parcs’ flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it
operates;

      - place Center Parcs at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt; and

      - increase its cost of borrowing.

Any failure to pay amounts due and payable under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements could give rise to an event
of default or a Share Enforcement Event (in the case of the Class B2 Loan) and the Borrower Security Trustee may, in such
circumstances, elect to declare all amounts outstanding under those agreements to be immediately due and payable and initiate
enforcement proceedings against the collateral provided by Center Parcs to secure its obligations under such agreements.

The consequences of a Share Enforcement Event are that the Borrower Security Trustee will be entitled, by notice,
to enforce the Topco Share Security in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of the Class B
Noteholders. See “Risks relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency”.

**_Center Parcs’ head office is subject to a first ranking mortgage which will not form part of the security package granted_**
**_pursuant to the Transaction, and if enforced could result in Center Parcs losing the use of its head office._**

Pursuant to a term loan facility agreement dated 8 November 2005 made between CP Opco and The Royal Bank of
Scotland plc (the “Head Office Loan”), Center Parcs Limited granted a fixed charge dated 8 November 2005 over all of its
legal interests in the head office (the “Head Office Mortgage”). As at 23 April 2015, £1.5 million remains outstanding under

46


-----

the Head Office Loan. The Head Office Mortgage does not form part of the security package granted pursuant to the
Transaction. If CP Opco fails to meet its repayment obligations under the Head Office Loan then the Head Office Mortgage
could be enforced, resulting in the sale of the head office to a third party. Center Parcs has in place business interruption
procedures to minimise the impact of a loss of its head office; however, should such an event occur there may be
administrative and financial implications which will impact on the ability of Center Parcs to meet its payment obligations
under the Loans and ultimately for the Issuer to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Notes.

**_Center Parcs is exposed to the creditworthiness of third party financial institutions._**

The creditworthiness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, derivative,
trading, clearing or other relationships among the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened defaults
by, one institution (or more) could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other
institutions. This may adversely affect the financial institutions, such as banks and insurance providers, with which Center
Parcs interacts on a regular basis, and therefore could adversely affect its ability to raise needed funds or access liquidity. See
“Forward-Looking Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Description of other Indebtedness.”_

**_Restrictive covenants in the Transaction Documents governing the Class A Loans and the Class B Loans may adversely_**
**_affect the operations of Center Parcs._**

The Transaction Documents limit the Obligors’ ability, among other things, with respect to:

      - the incurrence or guarantee of additional indebtedness;

      - the payment of dividends or other distributions on, and the redemption or repurchase of, its equity;

      - the making of certain restricted payments and investments;

      - the incurrence of certain liens;

      - the imposition of restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends and other payments to members of
the Group;

      - the transfer, lease, sale or other disposition of certain assets;

      - the merger, consolidation with, or sale of substantially all of the Group’s assets to, other entities;

      - the entry into certain transactions with affiliates;

      - the entry into sale and leaseback transactions; and

      - the impairment of the security interest for the noteholders.

In addition, the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement includes other more restrictive covenants and may restrict
the Obligors’ ability to prepay their other indebtedness, including the Class B2 Loan, while indebtedness under the Class A
Loans remain outstanding. The ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond the Borrowers’
control.

The restrictions contained in the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements could:

      - limit the Obligors’ ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict
their respective activities or business plans; and

      - adversely affect the ability to finance the Obligors’ operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances
or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in Center Parcs’ interest.

A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the minimum FCF DSCR requirement
in the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements could result in a default.

**_Loan Events of Default may occur without the knowledge of the Borrower Security Trustee if the Borrowers fail to notify_**
**_the Borrower Security Trustee of such event._**

The Borrower Deed of Charge provides that the Borrower Security Trustee will be entitled to assume, unless it is
otherwise disclosed in any investor report or compliance certificate or the Borrower Security Trustee is expressly informed
otherwise, that no Loan Event of Default or Potential Loan Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. The Borrower

47


-----

Security Trustee will not itself monitor whether any such event has occurred. As the Issuer is a special purpose company, it
will fall to the Obligors themselves to make these determinations as well as the determinations of the financial and operational
positions underlying them, which may be subjective. The Borrower Security Trustee shall not be obliged to make any such
determinations and shall be able to conclusively rely on any investor report or compliance certificate provided to it without
being obliged to enquire as to the accuracy or validity of any such investor report or compliance certificate.

**_The Class B2 Notes will be contractually subordinated to the Class A Notes as to payment and will rank junior to the_**
**_Class A Notes with respect to the application of enforcement proceeds, other than in respect of the Topco Security. As a_**
**_result, the Issuer may be unable to make payments on the Class B2 Notes when due._**

Pursuant to the applicable payment waterfall set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, payments to be made to the
holders of the Class B2 Notes in respect of principal and interest thereon will be contractually subordinated to corresponding
payments to be made to holders of the Class A Notes. Likewise, principal and interest payments to be made on the Class B2
Loan will be contractually subordinated to payments to be made on or under the Class A Loans and the Liquidity Facility,
among other things. Furthermore, subject to certain limited exceptions, the Obligors will not be permitted to make any
payments, including interest payments, under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement unless funded out of new equity,
and consequently the Issuer will not be able to make corresponding interest payments on the Class B2 Notes, if the Class A
Restricted Payment Condition is not satisfied including if the Class A FCF DSCR falls below 1.35x.

Furthermore, the Class B2 Notes will rank junior to the Class A Notes, and debt outstanding under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will rank junior to debt outstanding under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement
and the Liquidity Facility, among others, in each case in respect of the application of any amounts realised through the
enforcement of the security granted under the Issuer Security Documents and the Borrower Security Documents, respectively.
Accordingly, the proceeds of any enforcement of such security may not be sufficient to meet the Obligors’ payment
obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or the Issuer’s payment obligations with respect to the Class
B2 Notes following the application of such proceeds towards the full repayment of our prior ranking debt described above.
However, the Class B2 Notes will benefit from the Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco Security, which security will
not be shared with the Class A Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Topco Payment Undertaking”
and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Topco Security Agreement.”

In addition, for so long as the Class A Notes and the Class A Loans are outstanding, the holders of the Class B2
Notes will not be able to declare a Class B Note Event of Default and a Class B Loan Event of Default.

See “— Risks Relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements
_— Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement” and “Description of the Class B2 Loan” for further details._

**_Topco is a holding company and will depend upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the Topco_**
**_Payment Undertaking._**

Topco is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other than investments its
subsidiaries. Topco will depend upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the
Topco Payment Undertaking, pursuant to which Topco has undertaken to pay to the Borrower Security Trustee all principal,
interest and other amounts outstanding under the Class B Loans then outstanding in certain circumstances, including in the
event that the Class B2 Loan is not repaid in full on the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date. If Topco’s subsidiaries do
not, or are unable to, distribute cash to Topco in an amount sufficient to enable Topco to meet its obligations under the Topco
Payment Undertaking, Topco will not have any other source of funds that would allow it to make the necessary payments to
the Borrower Security Trustee. Failure by Topco to make such payments will give the right to the Borrower Security Trustee
(on instruction from the Class B Note Trustee or, as the case may be, the Class B Noteholders) to enforce the Topco Share
Security over the shares Topco holds in CP Cayman Limited and the share security granted to the Borrower Security Trustee
by CP Cayman Limited over the shares it holds in Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited. The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement and the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will also restrict the ability of Topco’s subsidiaries to move
cash within the Group. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of Topco’s subsidiaries will be permitted to pay
as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. Any such inability to transfer cash
within the Group may mean that even though the relevant entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to enable
Topco to meet its obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking, they may not be permitted to make the necessary
transfers from one entity to another in order to make payments, directly or indirectly, to Topco. Accordingly, we can provide
no assurances that Topco will be able meet its obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking should the need arise. In
addition, the Topco Payment Undertaking is limited in recourse to the Topco Secured Property and after enforcement of the
Topco Security Documents, Topco’s obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking will be deemed to be discharged in
full. If amounts outstanding under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement have not been paid in full following the
enforcement of the Topco Security, such amounts will remain outstanding and Class B2 Noteholders will not be entitled to
call a Class B Loan Event of Default until the earlier of the day on which all amounts outstanding under the Class A Issuer/
Borrower Loan Agreement are paid in full or the Class B2 Note Final Maturity Date.

**_We may not be able to redeem the Class B2 Notes in full on the Class B2 Note Expected Maturity Date, which falls 21.5_**
**_years earlier than the Class B2 Note Final Maturity Date, and thereafter, interest on the Class B2 Notes will be deferred._**

Following the Class B2 Note Step-Down Date, which falls in 2020, interest will accrue on the Class B2 Notes at a
reduced rate.

Our ability to redeem the Class B2 Notes in full on the Class B2 Note Expected Maturity Date will depend on the
repayment in full of the Class B2 Loan by the Borrower on the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date. This, in turn, will
depend on many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and financial, competitive, legislative,
regulatory and other factors, together with the other risks described in this Offering Circular. As a result, there can be no
guarantee that we will have sufficient funds available to repay the Class B2 Loan on the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity
Date and consequently redeem the Class B2 Notes in full on the Class B2 Note Expected Maturity Date. The Class B2 Note
Expected Maturity Date is on 2020, while the Class B2 Note Final Maturity Date is on 28 February 2042. The Class
B2 Loan and the Class B2 Notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of % per annum until the Class B2 Note Step-Down
Date, which is on 2020, after which the interest rate will continue to accrue at a reduced rate of % per annum.

Furthermore, the yield to maturity of the Class B2 Notes will depend on, among other things, the amount and timing
of repayment and prepayment of principal on the Class B2 Loan and the price paid by the holders of the Class B2 Notes. Such
yield may be adversely affected by a higher or lower than anticipated rate of prepayment on the Class B2 Loan. Timing for
prepayment of the Class B2 Loan cannot be predicted and will be influenced by a wide variety of factors, as described above.

Accordingly, we can provide no assurance with respect to timing of prepayments on the Class B2 Loan or as to
amounts to be prepaid and consequently the yield to maturity of the Class B2 Notes.

**_Sale of a Propco may have an adverse effect on the ability of the Borrowers to meet their obligations under the Loans and_**
**_ultimately affect the repayments on the Notes by the Issuer._**

Under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Obligors are permitted, subject to certain conditions, to
undertake sale and leaseback transactions in respect of one or more holiday parks. In each such case, provided that the
relevant conditions are satisfied, the Borrower Security Trustee will be required to give its consent to the disposal, to the
release of the property interest held by the relevant Propco, and (if the relevant Propco is also being disposed of at the same
time) to the release of the relevant Propco from its obligations, and from the security interests granted by it, under the
Transaction Documents.

Under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, these conditions include (but are not limited to) (a) the
requirement to prepay, pro rata, the then outstanding Class A Loans, together with any applicable premium payable at that
time in respect of a consequential redemption of the Class A Notes and (b) that the Class A Noteholders (voting as a single
class) have approved the entry into the relevant transaction in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and
the Note Trust Deed. A further condition which must be met is that the Borrower Security Trustee is satisfied (by virtue of a
Rating Agency Confirmation or a Ratings Assessment) that the then ratings of the Class A Notes will not be (i) downgraded
(ii) withdrawn or (iii) publicly placed on review for possible downgrade, as a result of the relevant sale and leaseback
transaction. See “Description of Other Indebtedness — Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement” for a fuller description of
the conditions which must be satisfied in order for the Obligors to be entitled to undertake sale and leaseback transactions in
respect of the holiday parks. There are no restrictions under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement to undertake a sale
and leaseback.

There is a risk that the potential benefits (in particular financial de-leveraging) of any sale and leaseback transaction
may not be fully realised as initially anticipated. In particular, there is a risk that rent increases (although required to be
capped at an average of 4% per annum) may become a financial burden for the Obligors which eventually affects the Issuer’s
ability to make payments of principal and interest under the Class A Notes and the Class B2 Notes.

Further, there is a risk that following a sale and leaseback of a Propco or a holiday park to a third party, such lease
might be terminated or forfeited by the relevant landlord with negative consequences for the Obligors. Risks might arise such
as the Obligors losing the use of a site and finding difficulty in locating a comparable replacement, loss of income from the
relevant holiday park and the introduction of competition to the remaining holiday parks secured in favour of the Borrower
Security Trustee through the development of the forfeited site as an alternative holiday destination.

**_Challenges by secured creditors of the financing transactions described in this Offering Circular could have a negative_**
**_impact on other secured creditors._**

The financing transactions described in this Offering Circular have been structured based on English law and
practice as in effect on the date of this Offering Circular. It is possible that a secured creditor which is subject to laws other
than the laws of England and Wales may seek to challenge the validity and/or enforceability of one or more features of the

49


-----

financing structure under the local laws of such creditor’s jurisdiction. Potential investors should be aware that the outcome of
any such challenge may depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to, the application of the laws of a
jurisdiction other than England and Wales. There can be no assurance that any challenge would not adversely affect directly
or indirectly the rights of the other secured creditors, including the Class B2 Noteholders, the market value of the Class B2
Notes and/or the ability of the Issuer to make interest and principal payments on the Class B2 Notes.

**RISKS RELATING TO TAXATION**

**_Change of tax law and practice might have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Issuer or the Obligors._**

The structure of the transaction, the issuance of the Offered Notes, the ratings that are to be assigned to them and the
statements in relation to taxation set out in this Offering Circular are based on current law and the published practice of the
relevant authorities in force or applied as at the date of this Offering Circular. Any changes in such law or practice might have
an adverse effect on the financial position of the Issuer or the Obligors and no assurance can be given as to the effect of any
possible judicial decision or change of law or the administrative practice of any jurisdiction after the date of this Offering
Circular.

**_Potential secondary tax liabilities of the members of the Obligor Group may result in a deterioration of the Borrowers’_**
**_financial condition which may, in turn, result in a deterioration of the Issuer’s financial condition._**

Where a company fails to discharge certain tax liabilities due and payable by it within a specified time period, UK
tax law imposes, in certain circumstances (including where that company has been sold so that it becomes controlled by
another person), secondary liability for those overdue taxes on other companies that are or have been members of the same
group of companies, or are or have been under common control, for tax purposes with the company that has not discharged its
tax liabilities.

Bidco, CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited and the Obligors have each undertaken in the Tax Deed of Covenant that no
steps have been or will be taken by it or any other member of the Group which could be expected to give rise to a secondary
tax liability for the Borrowers. If any secondary tax liabilities arise in the Borrowers (whether in respect of a primary tax
liability of a member of the Obligor Group or of another company with which the Borrowers are or have been grouped or
under common control for UK tax purposes), and those secondary tax liabilities are not discharged by Bidco, CP Cayman
Midco 1 Limited or any other member of the Obligor Group, and are of significant amounts, the financial condition of the
Borrowers could be adversely affected.

As a general matter, where companies are treated as members of a VAT group, any supply of goods or services
made by or to any member of the group (other than any such supply which is made by or to another member of the group) is
treated as made by or to the representative member of that group. Center Parcs (UK) Group Limited (in its capacity as the
representative member of the VAT group) is, therefore, the person required to account to H.M. Revenue & Customs
(“HMRC”) for any VAT chargeable on any supply made by or to any member of the VAT group (to or by any person other
than another member of the VAT group). All the other members of the VAT group are jointly and severally liable for any
VAT due from Center Parcs (UK) Group Limited to HMRC during their period of membership of the group. Center Parcs
(UK) Group Limited (in its capacity as the representative member of the VAT group) has undertaken in the Tax Deed of
Covenant that it has paid and will continue to pay all VAT payable by it to HMRC and to comply with all laws and
regulations relating to VAT. However, if such payments are not made and are of significant amounts, this may have a material
adverse effect on Center Parcs’ financial condition and results of operations. No company which is not an Obligor is a
member of the VAT group of which Center Parcs (UK) Group Limited is the representative member.

**_Borrowers’ UK tax position may change which may adversely affect the ability of the Borrowers to repay the Class A_**
**_Loans and Class B Loans and so the ability of the Issuer to repay the Notes._**

There can be no assurance that UK tax law and practice will not change in a manner (including, for example, an
increase in the rate of corporation tax) that would adversely affect the ability of the Borrowers to repay amounts of principal
and interest under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements. Similarly, UK tax law and practice can be subject to differing
interpretations and the Borrowers’ interpretation of the relevant tax law as applied to their transactions and activities may not
coincide with that of HMRC. As a result, transactions of the Borrowers may be challenged by HMRC and any profits of the
Borrowers from their activities in the UK may be assessed to additional tax which may adversely affect the ability of the
Borrowers to repay amounts of principal and interest under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements. If, in turn, the Issuer does
not receive all amounts due from the Borrowers under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements, the Issuer may not have
sufficient funds to enable it to meet its payment obligations under the Notes and/or any other payment obligations ranking in
priority to, or equally with, the Notes.

**_The payments on the Loans may be subject to withholding tax which may result in a prepayment of the Loans, and so an_**
**_early redemption of the Notes, and may also impact on the Borrowers’ ability to repay the Loans in full, and so the Issuer’s_**
**_ability to repay the Notes in full._**

The Borrowers will be required to make payments of interest to the Issuer under the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements without deduction or withholding for or on account of UK income tax if and for so long as the Issuer is and

50


-----

continues to be a person who is entitled to receive such payments gross of such a deduction or withholding. The Issuer has
been advised that it was (as at the Closing Date) and will be such a person as at the Third Closing Date.

In the event that any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax is required to be made from any payment due
to the Issuer under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the amount of that payment will be increased so that, after
such withholding or deduction has been made, the Issuer will receive a cash amount equal to the amount that it would have
received had no such withholding or deduction been required to be made.

If a Borrower is obliged to increase any sum payable by it to the Issuer as a result of such Borrower being required
to make a withholding or deduction from that payment under an Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Borrower will have the
option (but not the obligation) to prepay all relevant outstanding advances made under an Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in
full. If the Borrower chooses to prepay the advances made under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer will
then be required to redeem the Class A Notes. Such a redemption would be for a redemption price equal to the Principal
Amount Outstanding on the Class A Notes together with any accrued but unpaid interest. If the Borrower chooses to prepay
the advances made under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer will then be required to redeem the Class B
Notes. Such a redemption would be for a redemption price equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding on the Class B Notes
together with any accrued but unpaid interest. Investors should be aware that no break costs would be payable to the Class B
Noteholders in such circumstances. If the Borrower does not have sufficient funds to enable it either to repay the Issuer/
Borrower Loan Agreement or to make increased payments to the Issuer, the Issuer’s ability to make timely payments of
interest and principal under the Notes could be adversely affected.

**_If the Issuer were to cease to qualify as a securitisation company, this may have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s UK tax_**
**_position, which could adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make timely payment of interest and principal under the Notes._**

The Issuer is incorporated in Jersey and resident for tax purposes in the UK and has been advised that it should be a
“securitisation company” for the purposes of the Taxation of Securitisation Companies Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/3296).
Accordingly, the Issuer should be subject to corporation tax in the UK on its “retained profit” only, in accordance with the
special regime for securitisation companies as provided for by those regulations.

If the Issuer were to cease to qualify as a securitisation company for the purposes of those regulations, this may
have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s UK tax position, which could adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make timely
payment of interest and principal under the Notes.

**_The reorganisation of the Center Parcs Group in 2012 and historical tax position of the Obligor Group gave rise to certain_**
**_contingent tax liabilities, which could affect the Borrowers’ ability to meet their payment obligations under the Issuer/_**
**_Borrower Loan Agreements and could affect amounts realised on enforcement._**

The reorganisation and historical tax position of the group gave rise to certain contingent tax liabilities, in particular
potential substantial “degrouping charges” in respect of (i) the transfers of the headleases to CP Elveden Village Limited, CP
Sherwood Village Limited and CP Whinfell Village Limited and (ii) the transfer of the shares in CP Opco by Center Parcs
(Jersey) 1 Limited to Center Parcs (Holdings 3) Limited. Should these contingent tax liabilities crystallise, they could have an
impact upon the ability of the Borrowers to make payments of interest and principal under the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements (and so impact upon the ability of the Issuer to make payments of interest and principal on the Notes) and could
affect the amounts realised on enforcement.

Broadly speaking, degrouping charges arise where an asset held, otherwise than as trading stock, has been
transferred between members of the same group and the company which acquired the asset then ceases to be a member of that
group within six years of the date of the acquisition. If, when it leaves the group, that company, or another company with
which that company is grouped for tax purposes and which is also leaving the group, owns, otherwise than as trading stock,
the asset which was transferred intra-group, then the company leaving the group is treated as if, immediately after it acquired
the asset intra-group, it had sold and reacquired the asset for market value at that time. The broad effect of this deemed
disposal and reacquisition is to bring into charge to tax any gain deferred on the earlier intra-group transfer. Whether the
degrouping charge arises in the asset owning company leaving the group, or a group company disposing of the company or
companies leaving the group depends on the nature of the transaction.

Where two companies cease to be members of the group at the same time, no tax charge will arise in relation to any
previous intra-group transfer of assets between those two companies if, broadly speaking, either (i) the companies are both
grouped for tax purposes with another company on the date of the acquisition and remain so grouped with that other company
until immediately after they cease to be members of the group or (ii) one of the companies is a subsidiary (as defined for the
purpose of the applicable tax legislation) of the other company on the date of the acquisition and remains a subsidiary of the
other company until immediately after the companies cease to be members of the group.

Advice has been obtained that these contingent tax liabilities should only crystallise in the event that security is
realised by an administrative receiver or liquidator in certain ways in respect of certain assets (including the Headleases and

51


-----

shares referred to above) or in the event that an Obligor fails to discharge a liability to tax for which it is primarily liable.
Furthermore, advice has also been obtained as to how security should be realised (to the extent necessary) in order to avoid or
mitigate such liabilities. As such, it is expected to be possible to avoid or mitigate these contingent tax liabilities. However, it
is possible that realising security in a way which avoids or mitigates these contingent liabilities may, depending on the
specific circumstances, have an adverse effect on the amounts realised for the benefit of the Class B Noteholders.

**_Withholding under the EU Savings Directive may affect payments on Offered Notes._**

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC (the “EU Savings Directive”) on the taxation of savings income, member
states of the European Union (each a “Member State”) are required to provide to the tax authorities of other Member States
details of certain payments of interest or similar income paid or secured by a person established in a Member State to or for
the benefit of an individual resident in another Member State or certain limited types of entities established in another
Member State.

On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the
scope of the requirements described above (the “EU Amending Directive”). Member States are required to apply these new
requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the EU Savings Directive, in
particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The EU Amending Directive will also apply a “look
through approach” to payments made via certain persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts and partnerships),
where certain conditions are satisfied, where an individual resident in a Member State is regarded as the beneficial owner of
the payment for the purposes of the EU Savings Directive. This approach may in some cases apply where the person, entity or
arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union.

For a transitional period, Austria is instead required (unless during such period it elects otherwise) to operate a
withholding tax in relation to such payments (Luxembourg, which before 1 January 2015 also operated a withholding tax
under the transitional rules, has now replaced such withholding tax with the information reporting regime described above).
The transitional period will end after agreement on exchange of information is reached between the EU and certain non-EU
states.

A number of non-EU countries and territories, including Switzerland, have adopted equivalent measures (a
withholding system in the case of Switzerland).

However, the European Commission has proposed the repeal of the EU Savings Directive from 1 January 2017 in
the case of Austria and from 1 January 2016 in the case of all other Member States (subject to on-going requirements to fulfil
administrative obligations such as the reporting and exchange of information relating to, and accounting for withholding taxes
on, payments made before those dates). This is to prevent overlap between the EU Savings Directive and a new automatic
exchange of information regime to be implemented under Council Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative Cooperation in
the field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU). The proposal also provides that, if it proceeds,
Member States will not be required to apply the new requirements of the EU Amending Directive.

If a payment were to be made or collected through a Member State which has opted for a withholding system and an
amount of, or in respect of tax were to be withheld from that payment, neither the Issuer nor any Paying Agent nor any other
person would be obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any Offered Note as a result of the imposition of such
withholding tax. For so long as any Offered Note is outstanding, the Issuer is required to maintain a Paying Agent in a
Member State that does not impose an obligation to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the EU Savings Directive.

**_The Offered Notes may not be qualifying corporate bonds for UK tax purposes._**

In the case of Trigg v Revenue and Customs Comrs [2014] UKFTT 967 (TC) HM Revenue and Customs argued that
the inclusion of euro redenomination clauses in certain bonds prevented them from being qualifying corporate bonds for UK
tax purposes. The First-tier tribunal found against the Revenue, and the Revenue’s appeal is currently scheduled to be heard
by the Upper-tier tribunal in 2016.

The Offered Notes contain euro redenomination clauses similar to those considered in the case mentioned above. If
the euro redenomination clauses in the Offered Notes mean the Offered Notes are not qualifying corporate bonds, Noteholders
within the charge to UK tax (other than Noteholders who are UK corporation taxpayers) may be subject to tax on chargeable
gains in respect of a disposal of Offered Notes.

Prospective Noteholders who may be unsure as to their tax position should seek their own professional advice.

**_The market value of the Class B2 Notes may be adversely affected if Class B2 Further Notes are issued other than in a_**
**_qualified reopening for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Issuer may issue Class B2 Further Notes in additional offerings and these Class B2 Further Notes may not be
fungible with the Class B2 Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Whether Class B2 Further Notes would be fungible
depends on whether the issuance of Class B2 Further Notes would be treated as a qualified reopening for U.S. federal tax

52


-----

purposes. This determination will depend on the date when the Class B2 Further Notes are issued, the yield of the Class B2
Notes at that time (based on their fair market value), whether the Class B2 Notes were issued with OID and whether the Class
B2 Notes are publicly traded or quoted at the time of the Class B2 Further Notes issuance. If issuance of the Class B2 Further
Notes is not a qualified reopening, the Class B2 Further Notes may have a different amount of OID, which may adversely
affect the market value of the Class B2 Notes, unless the Class B2 Further Notes can be distinguished from the Class B2
Notes.

**RISKS RELATING TO SECURITY, ENFORCEMENT AND INSOLVENCY**

**_Enforcement of the Topco Share Security is subject to certain conditions which if not met could affect the ability of the_**
**_Class B Noteholders to realise the value of the security_**

Pursuant to the Topco Share Security Agreement, the enforcement of the Topco Share Security is conditional on the
Borrower Security Trustee receiving a tax opinion that confirms that there will not be any actual or contingent tax liability
arising in the Obligor Group as a result of such enforcement of more than £10 million. As at the Third Closing Date, it is not
expected that such enforcement would give rise to any tax liability. However, such a liability may arise in the future due to
(among other things) a change in tax law or practice. Should a tax opinion not be provided giving the requisite confirmations,
the Topco Share Security may only be enforced if the Borrower Security Trustee is provided with sufficient funds, other
collateral or other support arrangement to mitigate any such tax liability to the extent it exceeds £10 million. While the
structure of the transaction has been established to minimise the risk of this event occurring, no assurance can be given by the
Obligors that such conditions will be satisfied at the time of enforcement of the Topco Share Security. As a result the amounts
realised by the Class B Noteholders through enforcement may be significantly reduced and/or delayed.

**_The enforcement and disposal of the Borrower Secured Property by the Borrower Security Trustee may impact the_**
**_amounts realised by the Class B2 Noteholders._**

Pursuant to the term of the Intercreditor Agreement, whilst the Class A Notes are outstanding only the Class A
Noteholders are entitled to direct the Class A Note Trustee which in turn will direct the Issuer Security Trustee and then the
Borrower Security Trustee with regard to the enforcement of any Borrower Security. Neither the Class A Note Trustee nor the
Issuer Security Trustee will be obliged to take into consideration the interests of the Class B Noteholders when acting in
accordance with the directions received from the Class A Noteholders or in exercising their discretion in relation to
enforcement. Both the Class B Noteholders and any other Secured Creditors will be required to take any action (for example,
release security and/or guarantees) that the Class A Noteholders and/or the Class A Note Trustee and/or the Issuer Security
Trustee (as the case may be) require of them to enforce the Borrower Security including the extinguishment of all amounts
due under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in connection with an enforcement of the Borrower Security. All
amounts realised by the enforcement of the Borrower Security will be applied in accordance with the relevant Priorities of
Payments as stipulated in the Intercreditor Agreement. There is therefore a risk that the Class B Noteholders’ interests will not
be aligned to those of the Class A Noteholders and that the Class B Note Trustee will be directed to act against the wishes of
the Class B Noteholders, and without their control for so long as the Class A Notes remain outstanding. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement”._

For so long as there are any Class B Notes outstanding, the Borrower Security Trustee may only dispose of any
Borrower Secured Property with a value above £10 million if a fairness opinion from a financial advisor is first obtained.
However, the appointment of a financial advisor in such circumstances by the Borrower Security Trustee may be directed by
the Issuer Security Trustee on behalf of the Class A Noteholders only, and the Borrower Security Trustee shall not be obliged
to take into account the interests of any Secured Creditor (other than the Class A Noteholders) and may only seek direction
from the Issuer Security Trustee on behalf of the Class A Noteholders in relation to the method and timing of the enforcement
of such Borrower Secured Property and any matter relating to the fairness opinion. In the event that a fairness opinion is not
able to be produced, the disposal of any Borrower Secured Property will be undertaken by way of a competitive marketing
and sales process typical for such type of assets. Amounts realised by such a sales process could be less than amounts
recovered in a sale by the Borrower Security Trustee. The fairness opinion will only be required if there are Class B Notes
outstanding.

In addition, upon the occurrence of a Loan Event of Default, the Borrower Security Trustee has the power to
appoint an administrative receiver who would take control of all the assets of the English Obligors. Such receiver has wide
powers that would enable him to control the English Obligors and manage Center Parcs’ business in order to repay the
secured debt. In relation to the Propcos, the receiver could endeavour to dispose of the properties, in whole or in part, either
(1) through the sale of the Borrower Secured Property itself or (2) by the sale of the shares in the Propco through enforcing
the share pledge over the shares in the Propco.

In respect of any proposed disposal of the Borrower Secured Property, whether by an administrative receiver
appointed in respect of a Propco or otherwise, the relevant Borrower Secured Property could be sold subject to the terms of
the relevant headlease and the related documentation.

In respect of Longleat, the related documentation provides that the headleases (except the headlease of the Keepers
Cottage activity centre) may be transferred with the consent of the immediate landlord and the superior landlord. However, in

53


-----

the case of the superior landlord, the documentation does not provide that such consent may not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Prior to any transfer of the Keepers Cottage activity centre headlease, the Borrower Security Trustee is required to
offer to surrender the headlease to the superior landlord who has ten working days to accept a surrender of the Keepers
Cottage headlease at the price stipulated in the surrender offer. Therefore, a receiver or the Borrower Security Trustee may not
be able to dispose of the Longleat property directly through a sale of the property itself or via a special purpose vehicle unless
the superior landlord was prepared to give its consent to the assignment of the Longleat headleases on reasonable terms and
does not exercise its pre-emption right in respect of the Keepers Cottage activity centre. However, there is no restriction on a
sale of the shares in the Longleat Propco. Therefore, in such a scenario, the options available to an administrative receiver
could be limited and this could adversely affect the value which could be achieved on a sale of the Longleat property,
although, as noted, this would not prevent the disposal of the shares in the Longleat Propco to a purchaser.

**_Enforcement and/or acceleration of security._**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the relevant Instructing Group will be entitled to direct the relevant
trustee to enforce and/or accelerate the Borrower Security or Issuer Security (as applicable). In the case of any enforcement
and/or acceleration of any Borrower Security and Issuer Security, if the Instructing Group is the Class A Noteholders, then a
direction may only be given if such direction is in writing by the holders of at least 25% representing in aggregate principal
amount outstanding of any class of the Class A Notes then outstanding or if so directed by a resolution of any class of the
Class A Noteholders. In the case of the Topco Security (and the Borrower Security and the Issuer Security, if the Instructing
Group is the Class B Noteholders), then a direction may only be given if such direction is in writing by the holders
representing at least 30% in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Class B Notes then outstanding. The Intercreditor
Agreement will provide that the proceeds of the enforcement of any Borrower Security or Issuer Security may be distributed
to the Issuer and the Class A Noteholders in a form other than in cash.

**_Guarantees and security may constitute a transaction at an undervalue or preference._**

A liquidator or administrator appointed in England over an Obligor could apply to the court to unwind the issuance
of its guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believed that issuance of such constituted a transaction at an undervalue.
The Obligor Group believes that each guarantee will not be a transaction at an undervalue and that each guarantee will be
provided in good faith for the purposes of carrying on the business of each Obligor and its subsidiaries and that there are
reasonable grounds for believing that the transactions will benefit each such Obligor. However, there can be no assurance that
the provision of the guarantees will not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support the
Obligor Group analysis.

If the liquidator or administrator can show that any of the Obligor Group or one of the Obligors have given a
“preference” to any person within six months of the onset of liquidation or administration (or two years if the preference is to
a “connected person”) and, at the time of the preference, that Obligor Group or that Obligor were unable to pay their debts
within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 or became so as a result of the preferential transaction, a court
has the power, among other things, to void the preferential transaction. For these purposes, a company gives preference to a
person if that person is one of the company’s creditors (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities)
and the company takes an action which has the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event of the company
going into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position that person would have been in if that thing had not been
done. The court may not make an order avoiding a preferential transaction unless it is satisfied that the company was
influenced by a desire to put that person in a better position. This provision of English insolvency law may affect transactions
entered into or payments made by any of the Obligors during the relevant period prior to the liquidation or administration of
such Obligor.

In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by a company was made for less than fair value and
was made to shield assets from creditors, then the transaction may be set aside as a transaction defrauding creditors. Any
person who is a “victim” of the transaction, and not just liquidators or administrators, may assert such a claim. There is no
statutory time limit within which a claim must be made (although the normal provisions under the Limitation Act 1980 will
apply) and the company need not be insolvent at the time of the transaction. The Obligors do not believe that they have
entered into any transactions which may be regarded as being for less than fair value or to shield assets from their creditors.

**_The Borrower Security Trustee may be liable to third parties if recharacterised as a mortgagee in possession._**

The Borrower Security Trustee may be deemed to be a mortgagee in possession if there is physical entry into
possession of any village, a step-in enforcement of security or an act of control or influence which may amount, in effect, to
possession.

A mortgagee in possession may incur liabilities to third parties in nuisance and negligence and, under certain
statutes (including environmental legislation), can incur the liabilities of a property owner. The Borrower Security Trustee has
the absolute discretion, at any time, to refrain from taking any action under the Transaction Documents, including becoming a

54


-----

mortgagee in possession in respect of a village unless it is satisfied at that time that it is adequately indemnified. Subject to
being adequately indemnified under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Borrower Security Trustee ranks first in
respect of the Priorities of Payments, both prior to and following an event of default thereunder, in respect of payment of any
amounts owed to it under its indemnity, including in respect of the liabilities described in this paragraph.

**_Topco and CP Cayman Limited are Cayman Islands companies and the Topco Share Security Agreement is governed by_**
**_Cayman Islands law and therefore Cayman Islands law is applicable to the enforcement of the Topco Security._**

Pursuant to the Cayman law-governed Topco Share Security Agreement, shares in CP Cayman Limited (which is
incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands) are charged in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee. Accordingly,
insolvency proceedings with respect to Topco and CP Cayman Limited would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by,
Cayman Islands insolvency law. Cayman Islands law may not be as favourable to Class B Noteholders’ interests as the laws
of other jurisdictions with which Class B Noteholders are familiar. The application of these laws could adversely affect the
ability of the Borrower Security Trustee to enforce its rights under the security interests granted by a Cayman Obligor and
limit any amounts that may be received by the Class B Noteholders upon such enforcement.

In certain circumstances, there is a risk that a Cayman Islands court could deem that the charging of such security is
being made with a view to giving creditors a preference if it is a “related party” of the company. A creditor shall be treated as
a related party if it has the ability to control the company or exercise significant influence over the company in making
financial and operating decisions.

If any business of a company has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any
other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the Cayman Islands court may declare that any persons who were knowingly
parties to the carrying on of the business are liable to make contributions to the company’s assets as the Cayman Islands court
thinks proper.

There is an additional risk in that a Cayman Islands court would not necessarily recognise or enforce security
against the relevant secured asset, in this case the shares, in the absence of a court order obtained pursuant to foreclosure
proceedings. A Cayman Islands court may treat a purported fixed charge over assets as a floating charge if the Cayman
Islands company has sufficient authority to deal with its assets in the course of its business and/or if the holder of security
does not exercise sufficient control over the relevant assets. Any charge in the nature of a floating charge will not take priority
in ranking over any subsequent fixed mortgage or charge or lien which is created prior to the crystallisation of the floating
charge. However, advice has been taken from Cayman Islands counsel that subject to standard reservations and assumptions,
the Topco Share Security Agreement will create a valid security interest over the property intended to be secured by such
agreement in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee and the courts in the Cayman Islands will recognise such security
interests.

In the case of a winding-up of a Cayman Islands company in a jurisdiction other than the Cayman Islands, the
priority of any security granted by or over the assets of that Cayman Islands company may be affected by any provision of the
laws of that jurisdiction as to the priority of claims in a winding-up. To the extent that the security is held in the Cayman
Islands, failure to comply with any restrictions or provisions applicable to the granting of security over any such security or
the transfer thereof, whether arising under Cayman Islands law generally or pursuant to specific documentation relating to
such security, may, among other things, invalidate any purported security interest.

**_Certain Obligors and the Issuer are incorporated in jurisdictions other than England and Wales and therefore may be_**
**_subject to overseas insolvency law on the security enforcement process._**

While Center Parcs (Jersey) 1 Limited and Carp (Jersey) 2 Limited (the “Jersey Obligors”) and the Issuer are
incorporated in Jersey, they will each be a tax resident in the United Kingdom (from where they will be controlled and all
management functions will be operated).

Under the EC Regulation No 1346/2000 on Insolvency Proceedings 2000 (the “EUIR”), “main” insolvency
proceedings in respect of a debtor should be opened in the member state in which its centre of main interests (“COMI”) is
located. However, decisions by the European Court of Justice have held that this presumption can only be rebutted if factors
which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties are present. Given the fact that the Issuer and the Jersey Obligors
are managed and operated from England, and that this is ascertainable to a third party creditor (such that the creditor would
assume their COMI was in England), it is likely that the Issuer’s and the Jersey Obligors’ COMI is in England as opposed to
Jersey. If this is the case, the Issuer and the Jersey Obligors may be subject to English administration, company voluntary
arrangement, and certain liquidation proceedings. Alternatively, English insolvency law may also be applicable to the Issuer
and the Jersey Obligors if a request for assistance is made by the Jersey court to the English court under section 426 of the
Insolvency Act 1986.

Even if the Issuer’s or the Jersey Obligors’ COMI were in England, or section 426 of the Insolvency Act 1986
applied, it is unlikely that it will be possible to appoint an administrative receiver in respect of the Issuer or the Jersey
Obligors in England (so as to prevent the appointment of an English administrator) using the capital market exemption

55


-----

described in more detail below. This is because notwithstanding the fact that their COMI may be in England, none of the
Issuer or the Jersey Obligors is likely to be considered to be a “company” for the purposes of section 29 of the Insolvency Act
1986 since it is not formed under one of the UK Companies Acts.

In respect of any insolvency proceedings in relation to Topco and CP Cayman Limited, the UNCITRAL
Implementing Regulations (as defined below) may apply. This may inhibit the ability of the relevant trustee to appoint a
receiver in respect of Topco and/or CP Cayman Limited or may impose a mandatory stay on insolvency proceedings in the
English courts which ultimately could lead to a delay in the realisation of security and/or a reduction in the amounts received
from such realisation.

The UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency was implemented in Great Britain and Northern Ireland
on 4 April 2006 by The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, SI 2006/1030 (the “UNCITRAL Implementing
**Regulations”). Under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations, if foreign insolvency proceedings are commenced in**
respect of a company, then, upon application by the foreign insolvency officeholder and provided that certain requirements
are met, the English courts are required to recognise such proceedings. Any such recognition may in effect impact upon the
availability of certain types of creditor action in England and Wales and/or, provided certain further requirements are met,
result in the application of English avoidance (including claw-back) provisions.

In addition, if the relevant foreign insolvency proceedings are recognised as “foreign main proceedings” (and there
is no conflict with the EUIR), then an automatic mandatory stay on certain types of creditor action (including the
commencement of certain legal proceedings) and the disposal by the company of its assets will apply in England and Wales.
In general, this stay will not restrict rights relating to the enforcement of security or set-off (so long as these rights could be
exercised in an English winding-up). However, the foreign officeholder may also make an application to an English court to
exercise its discretion to provide further relief, including the imposition of a wider stay (which may extend to restrictions on
the rights referred to above), particularly if the foreign proceedings in question are reorganisation proceedings which, under
the foreign insolvency law, give rise to a stay on security enforcement.

UK Parcs Holding S.a` r.l. is incorporated in Luxembourg and will not have tax residency or be controlled or
managed within the United Kingdom. It is therefore likely that UK Parcs Holdings S.a.r.l.’s COMI will be presumed to be in
Luxembourg and (if this presumption is not rebutted) it would be likely to enter into Luxembourg insolvency proceedings.
The UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations may also apply in respect of any insolvency proceedings in relation to UK Parcs
Holding S.a` r.l., although to the extent there is any conflict under the EUIR and the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations,
the requirements of the EUIR will prevail.

**_Fixed security interests may be recharacterised as floating security interests due to the degree of control exercised over_**
**_certain underlying assets, including over bank accounts, and as a result the full proceeds of enforcement may not be_**
**_available to repay the Class B2 Notes._**

There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the security
documents governed by English law could take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as fixed charges is
not determinative.

Whether the fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests
will depend, among other things, on whether the Borrower Security Trustee or, as the case may be, the Issuer Security Trustee
has the requisite degree of control over the relevant assets and exercises that control in practice.

Each Borrower has established a number of bank accounts into which, among other things, rental income and
disposal proceeds in respect of the relevant villages must be paid. Each Borrower has, pursuant to the terms of the Borrower
Deed of Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge, granted security over all of its interests in its relevant accounts, which
security is, other than in the case of certain operating accounts, expressed to be a first fixed charge. Furthermore, under the
Issuer Deed of Charge, the Issuer has granted security over all of its bank accounts, which security is also expressed to be
fixed security.

Although the various bank accounts are stated to be subject to various degrees of control, there is a risk that, if the
Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee (as applicable) does not exercise the requisite degree of control over
the relevant accounts in practice, a court could determine that the security interests granted in respect of those accounts take
effect as floating security interests only and that the security interests granted over the assets from which the monies paid into
the accounts are derived also take effect as floating security interests only, notwithstanding that the security interests are
expressed to be fixed. In such circumstances, monies paid into accounts or derived from those assets could be diverted to pay
preferential creditors, the costs of the insolvency process, and certain other liabilities were a receiver, liquidator or
administrator to be appointed in respect of the relevant company in whose name the account is held.

If the fixed security interests are recharacterised as floating security interests, the claims of (i) the unsecured
creditors of the relevant Obligor incorporated in England and Wales (or otherwise subject to insolvency proceedings in

56


-----

England and Wales) or, as the case may be, the Issuer in respect of that part of the relevant Obligor’s net property which is
ring-fenced as a result of the Enterprise Act 2002 and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the relevant
English Obligor, may have priority over the rights of the Borrower Security Trustee or the Issuer Security Trustee, as the case
may be, to the proceeds of enforcement of such security in accordance with s176A of the Insolvency Act 1986. To the extent
that the assets of the Issuer or any Obligor are subject only to a floating charge (including any fixed charge recharacterised by
the courts as a floating charge), in certain circumstances under the provisions of section 176A of the Insolvency Act 1986,
certain floating charge realisations which would otherwise be available to satisfy the claims of secured creditors under the
Issuer Deed of Charge or the Borrower Deed of Charge or the Woburn Deed of Charge may be first used to satisfy any claims
of unsecured creditors, up to an amount equal to £600,000 in respect of each relevant Obligor. As a result, the full amount of
the proceeds of enforcement of the security may not be available to repay Notes.

Further, the costs and expenses of a liquidation or administration (including corporation tax on capital gains) will be
payable out of floating charge assets in priority to the claims of the floating charge-holder. As a result of the changes
described above, upon the enforcement of the floating charge security granted by an Obligor subject to an English liquidation
or administration, floating charge realisations which would otherwise be available to satisfy the claims of secured creditors
under the Issuer Deed of Charge and/or the Borrower Deed of Charge and/or the Woburn Deed of Charge will be reduced by
at least a significant proportion of any liquidation or administration expenses.

**_Floating charges given by the English Obligors may be deemed invalid for lack of consideration which would hinder the_**
**_appointment of an administrative receiver._**

Section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by a
company may be invalid in whole or in part. If a floating charge is held to be wholly invalid then it will not be possible to
appoint an administrative receiver of such company and, therefore, it will not be possible to prevent the appointment of an
administrator of such company. The risk is, if a liquidator or administrator is appointed to the Issuer or the relevant Obligor
within a period of two years (the “relevant time”) commencing upon the date on which the Issuer or that Obligor, as the case
may be, grants a floating charge, the floating charge granted by the Issuer or that Obligor, as the case may be, will be invalid
pursuant to section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986 except to the extent of the consideration received by the relevant chargor
at the time of or after the creation of the floating charge. The Issuer received consideration (namely, the Issuer issued the
Original Class A Notes and the Original Class B Notes on the Closing Date and the Second Class A Notes on the Second
Issue Date and will issue the Class B2 Notes on the Third Closing Date and has received or will receive the subscription
monies therefor) and each of the Obligors will have received such consideration (namely, the Borrowers made a drawing
under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements on the Closing Date and under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement on
the Second Closing Date and will, on the Third Closing Date, make a drawing under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement). As such, during the relevant time the floating charge granted by the Issuer will be valid to the extent of the
amount of Notes issued by the Issuer, the floating charges granted by the Borrowers will be valid to the extent of the amount
drawn by the Borrowers under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements and the floating charge granted by each of the other
Obligors will be valid to the extent of the fee paid to the other Obligors but not valid for the full amount of the property
charged. However, such limitation on the validity of the floating charges will not necessarily affect the ability of the Borrower
Security Trustee to appoint an administrative receiver provided that the floating charge still extends and is valid in relation to
substantially all of the respective Obligor’s property in respect of the English Obligors — however, this will be a factual
question to be determined at the time of a potential appointment. After the relevant time it will not be possible for the floating
charges granted by each of the Issuer, the Borrowers or the English Obligors to be invalidated under section 245 of the
Insolvency Act 1986.

It should be noted that, since the Jersey Obligors, UK Parcs Holding S.à r.l. (together the “Foreign Obligors”) and
the Issuer are incorporated in jurisdictions other than England and Wales, it is unlikely that it will be possible to appoint an
administrative receiver in respect of these entities in England (so as to prevent the appointment of an English administrator)
using the capital markets provisions referred to below. Accordingly, if the Issuer’s and the Foreign Obligors’ COMI were
found to be in England, they could be placed into administration. However, it should be noted that the Issuer is structured to
be “bankruptcy remote” so therefore it should not be subject to any insolvency proceedings. The main asset-owning Obligors
(namely CP Opco, CP Woburn Opco and the Propcos) and their immediate parent companies are all English companies so
therefore administrative receivership is possible for these companies.

**_The ability of the Borrower Secured Creditors to appoint an administrative receiver may be hindered by the application of_**
**_the Enterprise Act 2002 in respect of floating charges._**

The provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the “Enterprise Act”) restrict the right of the holder of a floating charge
to appoint an administrative receiver (unless the security was created prior to 15 September 2003 or an exception applies) and
instead give primacy to collective insolvency procedures (in particular, administration).

The Insolvency Act 1986 contains provisions that continue to allow for the appointment of an administrative
receiver in relation to certain transactions in the capital markets. The relevant exception provides that the appointment of an
administrative receiver is not prohibited if it is made in pursuance of an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market
arrangement (as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986) under which a party incurs or, when such agreement was entered into

57


-----

was expected to incur, a debt of at least £50,000,000 and if the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment
(also defined in the Insolvency Act 1986, but generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). Whilst there is no case law,
as yet, on how these provisions will be interpreted, it should be applicable to floating charges created by the English Obligors
and assigned by way of security to the Borrower Security Trustee. However, as this issue is partly a question of fact, were it
not possible to appoint an administrative receiver in respect of one or more of the English Obligors, they would be subject to
administration if they were to become insolvent.

The UK Secretary of State may, by secondary legislation, modify the exceptions to the prohibition on appointing an
administrative receiver and/or provide that the exception shall cease to have effect. No assurance can be given that any such
modification or provision in respect of the capital market exception, or its ceasing to be applicable to the transactions
described in this Offering Circular, will not be detrimental to the interests of the Class B Noteholders.

**_Certain members of the Obligor Group may fall within the “small companies” threshold allowing them the right to seek a_**
**_moratorium which could restrict creditors’ ability to enforce security._**

Certain small companies, as part of the company voluntary arrangement procedure in England, may seek court
protection from their creditors by way of a moratorium (which will, amongst other things, restrict a creditor’s ability to
enforce security, prevent the appointment of an administrator or liquidator and restrict proceedings being commenced or
continued against the company) for a period of up to 28 days, with the option for creditors to extend this protection for up to a
further two months (although the UK Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills may, by order, extend or reduce
the duration of either period).

A “small company” is defined for these purposes by reference to whether the company meets certain tests contained
in section 382(3) of the Companies Act 2006, relating to a company’s balance sheet, total turnover and average number of
employees in a particular period. The position as to whether or not a company is a small company may change from period to
period, depending on its financial position and average number of employees during that particular period. The UK Secretary
of State for Business, Innovation and Skills may by regulations also modify the qualifications for eligibility of a company for
a moratorium and may also modify the present definition of a small company. Accordingly, any of the Obligors may, at any
given time, come within the ambit of the small companies provisions, such that any such Obligor may (subject to the
exemptions referred to below) be eligible to seek a moratorium, in advance of a company voluntary arrangement.

Certain companies which qualify as small companies for the purposes of these provisions may, nonetheless, be
excluded from being so eligible for a moratorium under the provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986 (Amendment No. 3)
Regulations 2002. Companies excluded from eligibility for a moratorium include those which are party to a capital market
arrangement, under which a debt of at least £10 million is incurred and which involves the issue of a capital market
investment. The definitions of capital market arrangement and capital market investment are broad and are such that, in
general terms, any company which is a party to an arrangement which involves at least £10 million of debt, the granting of
security to a note trustee, and the issue of a rated, listed or traded debt instrument, is excluded from being eligible for a
moratorium. The UK Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills may modify the criteria by reference to which a
company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible.

Accordingly, the provisions described above will serve to limit the Borrower Security Trustee’s ability to enforce
the Borrower Security to the extent that, first, any of the Obligors fall within the criteria for eligibility for a moratorium at the
time a moratorium is sought; second, if the directors of any such Obligor seeks a moratorium in advance of a company
voluntary arrangement; and, third, if any such Obligor is considered not to fall within the capital market exception (as
expressed or modified at the relevant time) or any other applicable exception at the relevant time; in those circumstances, the
enforcement of any security by the Borrower Security Trustee will be for a period prohibited by the imposition of the
moratorium. In addition, the other effects resulting from the imposition of a moratorium described above may impact the
transaction in a manner detrimental to the holders of the Offered Notes.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS AND THE ESCROW OF PROCEEDS**

**_The Acquisition is subject to uncertainties and risks._**

On 2 June 2015, the Purchaser, an entity managed by affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Inc., entered into
the Acquisition Agreement with the Sellers to acquire the entire issued share capital of the Target Companies and certain
shares in the capital of Topco. The consummation of the Acquisition is expected to occur on or prior to 3 August 2015 or such
other date as CP Cayman Topco and the Purchaser may agree. The consummation of the Acquisition pursuant to the
Acquisition Agreement is not subject to any anti-trust, regulatory or other conditions; however, the Acquisition Agreement
contains customary closing obligations. If any party fails to comply with such obligations, the Acquisition Agreement may be
terminated by the non-defaulting party. There can be no assurance that all of the closing obligations will be satisfied or
waived or that other events will not delay or result in termination of the Acquisition Agreement. Any delay in closing or
termination of the Acquisition Agreement could have a negative impact on our business, as well as our relationships with our
customers, vendors and employees.

58


-----

**_Our business could be adversely impacted as a result of uncertainty related to the Transactions and significant costs,_**
**_expenses and fees_**

The Transactions, if consummated, could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could
have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example:

      - the attention of management has been and may continue to be directed to ongoing transaction-related
considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day operations of our business;

      - other employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our
ability to retain and hire key personnel and other employees; and

      - suppliers or other parties with which we maintain business relationships may experience uncertainty about our
future and seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their business relationships with us.

In addition, we incurred significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in
connection with the negotiation of the Transactions.

**_If the Mandatory Exchange does not occur, the Exchangeable Note Issuer will be required to redeem the Exchangeable_**
**_Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Exchangeable Notes._**

The offering of the Exchangeable Notes will be consummated before the closing of the Acquisition. The
Acquisition cannot close until the conditions under the Acquisition Agreement have been satisfied or waived. Pending the
consummation of the Acquisition, the gross proceeds from the Offering will be held in the Escrow Account pending the
Mandatory Exchange. In the event that (i) the Mandatory Exchange does not occur on or prior to the Longstop Date, (ii) the
Purchaser announces its intention to abandon the Acquisition or the Sellers having announced that they have decided to sell
the Target Companies or any of its direct or indirect parent entities or significant subsidiaries to an entity other than the
Purchaser or one or more of its affiliates, (iii) the Purchaser notifies the Exchangeable Note Trustee and the Principal Paying
Agent that in its reasonable judgment the Acquisition will not be completed by the Longstop Date, (iv) the Acquisition
Agreement terminates without the Acquisition having been consummated at any time on or prior to the Longstop Date, (v) the
Purchaser ceases to beneficially own and control the majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Exchangeable
Note Issuer or (v) certain insolvency defaults or events of default occur on or prior to the Longstop Date, the Exchangeable
Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption and the Exchangeable Note Issuer will redeem all (but not some
only) of the Exchangeable Notes at 100% of the aggregate issue price together with accrued but unpaid interest to the date of
such redemption. If such a redemption occurs you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an
investment that yields comparable results to the Offered Notes. In addition, if you purchase the Exchangeable Notes at a price
greater than the issue price of the Exchangeable Notes, you may suffer a loss on your investment. Although we currently
believe that all conditions to the Acquisition will be satisfied or waived and expect to consummate the Acquisition on or
before the Longstop Date, we cannot assure you that the conditions to the closing of the Acquisition will be satisfied or
waived, that we will close the Acquisition on substantially the terms described in this Offering Circular or that we will not
otherwise be required to redeem the Exchangeable Notes.

**_Until the consummation of the Acquisition, the Exchangeable Note Issuer will have limited assets and the Exchangeable_**
**_Notes will not be guaranteed._**

Holders of the Exchangeable Notes will not have any recourse to the Issuer, the Borrowers, the other Obligors or the
Topco Obligors. The Exchangeable Notes will be the obligation solely of the Exchangeable Note Issuer. Until consummation
of the Acquisition, the Exchangeable Note Issuer will have limited assets (except for its interest in the Escrow Account) and,
as a result, the sole recourse of the holders of the Exchangeable Notes will be to the Escrowed Funds deposited in the Escrow
Account.

**_The Brookfield Funds do not currently control the Target Companies and their subsidiaries and will not control the Target_**
**_Companies and their subsidiaries until the consummation of the Acquisition._**

The Target Companies and their subsidiaries are currently controlled by the Blackstone Funds. The Brookfield
Funds will not obtain control of the Target Companies and their subsidiaries until consummation of the Acquisition. There is
no assurance that the business of the Target Companies will be operated during the interim period in the same way that it
would be operated under the controls of the Brookfield Funds.

**_Between the time of the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes and the consummation of the Acquisition, the parties to the_**
**_Acquisition Agreement may agree to modify or waive the terms or conditions of the Acquisition Agreement without consent_**
**_of the holders of the Exchangeable Notes._**

The Acquisition is expected to be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement.
However, the Acquisition Agreement may be amended and the closing conditions may be waived at any time by the parties

thereto, without the consent of holders of the Exchangeable Notes. Furthermore, any amendments made to the Acquisition
Agreement may make the Acquisition less attractive. Any amendment made to the Acquisition Agreement may be materially
adverse to holders of the Offered Notes, which, in turn, may have an adverse effect on the return you expect to receive on the
Offered Notes.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE OFFERED NOTES**

**_The Offered Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors._**

Each potential investor in the Offered Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own
circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

      - have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Offered Notes, the merits
and risks of investing in the Offered Notes and the information contained in this Offering Circular;

      - have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular
financial situation, an investment in the Offered Notes and the impact the Offered Notes will have on its
overall investment portfolio;

      - have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Offered Notes,
including Offered Notes where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential
investor’s currency;

      - understand thoroughly the terms of the Offered Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant
indices and financial markets; and

      - be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial advisor) possible economic and interest rate
scenarios and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.

The Offered Notes are complex financial instruments. Sophisticated institutional investors generally do not purchase
complex financial instruments as standalone investments. They purchase complex financial instruments as a way to reduce
risk or enhance yield with an understood, measured and appropriate addition of risk to their overall portfolios. A potential
investor should not invest in Offered Notes that are complex financial instruments unless it has the expertise (either alone or
with a financial advisor) to evaluate how the Offered Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on
the value of the Offered Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor’s overall investment
portfolio.

In addition, the market value of the Offered Notes may fluctuate for a number of reasons including due to prevailing
market conditions, current interest rates and the perceived creditworthiness of the Issuer and the Obligors. Any perceived
threat of insolvency or other financial difficulties of the Obligors or a less favourable outlook of the holiday industry in the
UK could result in a downgrade of ratings and/or a decline in market value of the Offered Notes.

**_Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments._**

The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or
regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisors to determine whether and to what
extent (1) the Offered Notes are legal investments for it; (2) the Offered Notes can be used as security for indebtedness; and
(3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any of the Offered Notes. Financial institutions should consult their
legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of the Class B2 Notes under any applicable
risk-based capital or similar rules.

**_The Issuer is a special purpose company with no business operations or assets._**

The Class B2 Notes will be limited recourse obligations of the Issuer. The Issuer is a special purpose company with
no business operations other than the issuance of the Notes and the transactions ancillary thereto. The Class B2 Notes will not
be obligations or responsibilities of, or guaranteed by, any other entity.

The Class B2 Notes will not be obligations or responsibilities of, and will not be guaranteed by, the Class A Note
Trustee, the Class B Note Trustee, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Class A Global Coordinator and Arranger, the Class B
Global Coordinator and Arranger, the Joint Bookrunners, the Liquidity Facility Providers, the Cash Manager, the Paying
Agents, the Class A Registrar, the Class B Registrar, the Class A Transfer Agent, the Class B Transfer Agent, the Issuer
Account Bank, the Borrower Account Bank, the Borrower Security Trustee, any of the Obligors or any company in the same
group of companies as, or affiliated to, the Parent (other than the Issuer itself but without prejudice to the Obligors’

60


-----

obligations to the Issuer under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements). Furthermore, no such person other than the Issuer will
accept any liability whatsoever to Class B2 Noteholders in respect of any failure by the Issuer to pay any amounts due under
the Class B2 Notes.

The ability of the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Class B2 Notes will be dependent on:

(a) the receipt by it of funds from the Obligors under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement; and

(b) the receipt by it of interest (if any) from monies standing to the credit of the Issuer Transaction Account,
or otherwise from certain Eligible Investments (each as defined below) made by it or on its behalf.

**_The Class B Notes are subordinated to the Class A Notes and rank behind the Class A Notes as to payment and security._**

Pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, payments to be made to the Class B Noteholders in
respect of principal and interest in relation to the Class B Notes, including the Class B2 Notes, are subordinated to payments
in respect of the Class A Notes in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payments. The Obligors are not permitted to
pay interest due and payable on Class B Loans and subsequently the Issuer will not be able to make payments on the Class B
Notes in the event that the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is no longer satisfied on any Note Interest Payment Date
(unless such payment is made using New Equity Funds received for this purpose).

Furthermore, the Class B Noteholders have limited ability to call a Class B Note Event of Default and a Class B
Loan Event of Default and rank behind the Class A Noteholders in respect of any amounts realised through the enforcement
of security granted under the Issuer Deed of Charge or the Borrower Deed of Charge. There is a risk that the proceeds of an
enforcement of security at either the Borrowers’ level or the Issuer level will not be sufficient to meet the Issuer’s payment
obligations with respect to the Class B Notes following the full repayment of its obligations under the Class A Notes.
Furthermore, in certain Class A Loan enforcement scenarios, Class B Loans may be extinguished — see the section
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement”. However, the Class B Notes indirectly benefit
from the Topco Payment Undertaking and first ranking security under the Topco Share Security — see “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements — Topco Payment Undertaking — Topco Share Security Agreement”._

See “Risks relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency”, “Description of other Indebtedness — Class A Issuer/
_Borrower Loan Agreement” and “Description of the Class B Loan” for further details._

**_Risks in relation to the proceeds received from the enforcement of the Topco Security Documents for the Class B2 Loan_**
**_and Class B2 Notes._**

Pursuant to the Topco Payment Undertaking, Topco will undertake to pay or procure the payment of an amount
equal to the aggregate of: (i) the then principal balance of the Class B Loans; (ii) accrued but unpaid interest outstanding in
respect of the Class B Loans, Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon;
(iii) any Additional Amounts; and (iv) all other amounts due and payable under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,
on the earlier of (A) a Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date and (B) the date on which Topco receives a valid demand notice
from the Borrower Security Trustee following the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event and/or a Class B Loan Event of
Default. In addition, Topco will grant as security all of its shares in CP Cayman Limited in favour of the Borrower Security
Trustee to hold for the benefit of the Issuer under the Topco Security Documents. CP Cayman Limited will then grant as
security all of its shares in Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee to hold for the
benefit of the Issuer under the CP Cayman Security Agreement.

The Borrower Security Trustee on behalf of the Issuer will be entitled to enforce the Topco Security Documents
upon any Share Enforcement Event pursuant to the Transaction Documents. Such enforcement by the Borrower Security
Trustee will not constitute either a Class A Note Event of Default, or a Class B Note Event of Default. If, for example, upon
the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event, the Class B Noteholders call under the Topco Payment Undertaking and
enforce the Topco Security Documents, the Obligor Group could be owned by a different entity. Any such change in
ownership of the Obligor Group would not constitute a change of control under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements but
may have an adverse effect on the business and administration of Center Parcs and may affect the Borrowers’ ability to make
repayments on the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements when they fall due and as such affect the ability of the Issuer to repay
both the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes.

No assurance can be given that the proceeds realised as a result of an enforcement of any Topco Security
Documents will be sufficient to discharge in full the amounts due on the Class B2 Loan and as a result the Class B2 Notes,
nor that the Class B2 Noteholders will not be adversely affected by such realisation or enforcement. See “Risks relating to
_Security, Enforcement and Insolvency”._

61


-----

**_Center Parcs may not be able to repurchase the Class B2 Notes upon a Class B2 Change of Control and it may not be_**
**_certain that a Class B2 Change of Control has occurred or will occur._**

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a
“change of control”. Upon a Class B2 Change of Control under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Borrowers
will be required to make an offer to repurchase all the outstanding Class B2 Notes at a premium, plus any accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of repurchase. In such a situation, the Borrowers may not have enough funds to repurchase all of the Class
B2 Notes. In addition, by virtue of provisions in the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Obligors may be
prohibited from repurchasing the Class B2 Notes upon a Class B2 Change of Control. A Class B2 Change of Control in this
regard may cause disruption to the Center Parcs Group and may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Class B2
Loan and agreements governing any future indebtedness. As a result of such events occurring, the Class B2 Loan and any
future indebtedness may be accelerated.

For purposes of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, a “change of control” will include a disposition of all
or substantially all the assets of Topco and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain third parties. Although there
is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction in fact involves a disposition of “all or substantially all” the assets of Topco and its restricted
subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Class B2 Change of Control has occurred and
whether we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all the Class B2 Notes at the price described above. In addition, a
Class B2 Change of Control is only be deemed to have been triggered if, along with the occurrence of a “change of control”,
the current rating of the Class B2 is downgraded.

**_The expected maturity date of the Class B2 Notes is earlier than the final maturity date of the Class B2 Notes._**

There is no guarantee that the Issuer will have sufficient funds to redeem the Class B2 Notes on the Class B2 Note
Expected Maturity Date and such redemption is dependent on the repayment in full of the Class B2 Loan by the Borrowers.
The Class B2 Note Expected Maturity Date is 2020 and the Class B2 Note Final Maturity Date is 28 February 2042.

**_The Class B2 Noteholders will rank behind certain third parties in respect of certain obligations of the Issuer and the_**
**_Borrowers._**

Although the Issuer Security Trustee will hold the benefit of the Issuer Security on trust for the Class B2
Noteholders and the Borrower Security Trustee will hold the benefit of the Borrower Security on trust for the Borrower
Secured Creditors, such security interests will also be held on trust for certain third parties. Certain obligations of the Issuer to
third parties rank ahead of the Class B2 Noteholders. Such persons include, among others, the Class B Note Trustee (in its
individual capacity), the Class A Note Trustee (in its individual capacity), the Issuer Security Trustee (in its individual
capacity), the Liquidity Facility Providers, the Paying Agents and the Issuer Account Bank in respect of certain amounts owed
to them. To the extent that significant amounts are owing to any such persons, the amounts available to the Class B2
Noteholders will be reduced. Likewise, certain of the Borrowers’ obligations to certain third parties will rank ahead of their
obligations to the Issuer.

In addition, unsecured creditors of the Borrowers, such as trade creditors and suppliers, while subordinate to the
Borrower Secured Creditors, are not bound into the financing structure as they are not parties to the Borrower Deed of Charge
and so will be able to proceed directly against each of the Borrowers where they fail to pay any unsecured debts as they fall
due. For a more detailed description of the Priorities of Payments by the Issuer and by the Borrowers both prior and
subsequent to the enforcement of the security thereunder, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Issuer
_Deed of Charge” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement”._

**_The Issuer is dependent on third parties for the provision of certain services in relation to the Class B2 Notes._**

The Issuer is a party to contracts with a number of third parties who have agreed to perform certain services in
relation to, among other things, the Class B2 Notes. For example, the Liquidity Facility Providers have agreed to provide the
Liquidity Facility, the Issuer Corporate Services Provider and the Issuer Jersey Corporate Services Provider have agreed to
provide various corporate services to the Issuer and to the Issuer Parent, and the Cash Manager, the Issuer Account Banks and
the Paying Agents have agreed to provide, among other things, payment, administration and calculation services in connection
with the Class B2 Notes. In the event that any relevant third party fails to perform its obligations under the respective
agreements to which it is a party, the Class B2 Noteholders may be adversely affected.

**_The interests of Center Parcs’ principal shareholders may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Offered Notes._**

The interests of Center Parcs’ principal shareholders, in certain circumstances, may conflict with the interests of the
holders of the Offered Notes. After consummation of the Transactions, the Brookfield Funds will own approximately 99.3%
of Center Parcs’ shares and certain employees and members of management will own the remainder. See “Principal
_Shareholders”. As a result, the Brookfield Funds will have, directly or indirectly, the power, among other things, to affect_

62


-----

Center Parcs’ legal and capital structure and Center Parcs’ day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change
Center Parcs’ management and board of directors and to approve any other changes to Center Parcs’ operations. For example,
the Brookfield Funds could decide to cause Center Parcs to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or
make dividends, in each case, so long as the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit.
The interests of the Borrowers’ ultimate shareholders could conflict with the Class B2 Noteholders’ interests, particularly if
they encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay their debts when due. The incurrence of additional indebtedness
would increase Center Parcs’ debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce Center Parcs’ ability to
generate revenue, each of which could adversely affect holders of the Class B2 Notes.

**_There may be conflicts of interest between the holders of the different classes of the Notes and the Issuer may not be able_**
**_to repay the Class B2 Notes._**

The Class A Note Trustee will be required to have regard only to the interests of the holders of existing Class A
Notes and any new Class A Notes issued and the Class B Note Trustee will be required to have regard only to the interest of
the holders of existing Class B Notes and new Class B Notes issued after the Third Closing Date as if they formed a single
class (of Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable) when exercising his powers, trusts, authorities, duties and discretions
(except in certain circumstances as set out in the Note Trust Deed). Noteholders of each class of Notes may find their voting
powers diluted by the creation of new Notes and/or any further Notes.

The Class A Noteholders and Class B Noteholders each indirectly benefit from the covenant package given by the
Obligors in relation to each of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement. Each of the Class A Noteholders and/or Class B Noteholders may waive any breach of covenant specific to those
covenants given in their respective Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement without the consent of the alternate class of Noteholders.
There is a risk therefore that the Class A Noteholders may waive or amend the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement
without regard to the consequences for the Class B2 Noteholders. Additionally, where new Class A Notes and/or Further
Class A Notes are issued, there is an increased risk that Class B2 Notes may not be fully repaid by the Issuer.

**_The Class A Note Trustee may modify certain provisions of, or otherwise make decisions with respect to the Class B2 Notes_**
**_without consent of the Class B2 Noteholders._**

The Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee) will be
entitled to agree, without the consent of the relevant Class A Noteholders, the Class B2 Noteholders and any other Issuer
Secured Creditors, with the Issuer and any other relevant party to any of the Issuer Transaction Documents in making any
modification to the Class A Conditions, the Class B2 Conditions, the Note Trust Deed (other than (in the case of (c) and
(d) below) in respect of either a Class A Basic Terms Modification or a Class B Basic Terms Modification, the Class A Notes,
the Class B2 Notes or any other Issuer Transaction Documents to which it is a party or over which it has security, or may give
its consent to any event, matter or thing, if:

(a) in its opinion, the interest of the Class A Noteholders would not be materially prejudiced thereby; or

(b) in its opinion, such modification is required to correct a manifest error or is of a formal, minor,
administrative, or technical nature or one in respect of which the English court could reasonably be
expected to make a rectification order; or

(c) to the extent such event, matter or thing relates to an Entrenched Right and in its opinion, such
modification is required to correct a manifest error or is of a formal, minor, administrative or technical
nature; or

(d) it is required or permitted, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions, under the terms of the
Class A Conditions, the Class B2 Conditions or the Issuer Transaction Documents provided such
conditions are satisfied.

The Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee) shall be
entitled to determine, in its own opinion, for the purposes of exercising any right, power, trust, authority, duty or decision
under or in relation to the Class A Notes (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee in
relation to the Class B2 Notes), the Class A Conditions (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B
Note Trustee in relation to the Class B2 Conditions) or any of the Issuer Transaction Documents, that such exercise will not
be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class A Noteholders (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the
Class B2 Noteholders) or any relevant class thereof and in making such a determination shall be entitled to take into account,
amongst any other things it may consider necessary and/or appropriate in its absolute discretion, any confirmation by the
Rating Agencies (if available) that the then current rating of the Class A Notes (or following the full redemption of the
Class A Notes, the Class B2 Notes), or as the case may be, the relevant class thereof will not be downgraded, withdrawn or
qualified, and that, where any original rating of the Class A Notes (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the
Class B2 Notes) has been and continues to be downgraded, restoration of such original rating would not be prevented, as a
result of such exercise. For the avoidance of doubt, such rating confirmation or non-receipt of such rating confirmation shall,

63


-----

however, not be construed to mean that any such action or inaction (or contemplated action or inaction) or such exercise (or
contemplated exercise) by the Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note
Trustee) of any relevant right, power, trust, authority, duty or decision under or in relation to the Class A Notes (or following
the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B2 Notes), the Class A Conditions (or following the full redemption of the
Class A Notes, the Class B2 Conditions) or any other Issuer Transaction Documents is not materially prejudicial to the
interests of the holders of the Class A Notes or, as the case may be, that Class of Notes and the non-receipt of such ratings
confirmation shall not be construed to mean that such exercise by the Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption
of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee) as aforesaid is materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class A
Noteholders or, as the case may be, the Notes of the relevant Class.

The Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee) may,
without the consent or sanction of the Class A Noteholders, the Class B2 Noteholders or any other Issuer Secured Creditors,
authorise or waive any proposed breach of the covenants or provisions contained in the Note Trust Deed, the Class A Notes,
the Class B2 Notes, or any other Issuer Transaction Documents or determine that a Class A Note Event of Default and/or a
Class B Note Event of Default shall be treated as such if certain conditions are satisfied. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness — Class A Notes” and “Terms and Conditions of the Class B2 Notes”._

**_The Issuer Security Trustee and the Borrower Security Trustee may modify certain provisions of, or otherwise make_**
**_decisions with respect to the Issuer Transaction Document and the Borrower Transaction Document without consent of_**
**_the Class B2 Noteholders._**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that in connection with the accession of any Additional Site and issue of
any additional Notes or making any additional loans, any consequential amendments, consents or waivers required to be made
or granted pursuant to any Transaction Document to give effect to such transaction or transactions will not (a) constitute an
Entrenched Right and so not require the consent of any Affected Secured Creditor (and such Affected Secured Creditor may
be any of the Class B2 Noteholders) to effect such changes and (b) will not constitute a General Matter and so will not require
the consent of the relevant Instructing Group (and such relevant Instructing Group may be any of the Class B2 Noteholders) to
effect such changes. The Issuer Security Trustee and the Borrower Security Trustee will be authorised to execute any
documents and to give effect to such changes without incurring any liability for doing so.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Borrower Security Trustee in respect of a Borrower Transaction
Document and the Issuer Security Trustee in respect of an Issuer Transaction Document may approve an amendment, waiver
or consent in respect of such document if it is of the opinion that the relevant action is formal, minor, administrative or
technical, or one in respect of which the English court could reasonably be expected to make a rectification order (“Relevant
**Action”). In such circumstances, such Relevant Action may be taken without the consent of the Class B2 Noteholders, the**
Issuer Secured Creditors or the Borrower Secured Creditors. The Relevant Action may be taken in respect of an Entrenched
Right.

The Issuer Security Trustee, Borrower Security Trustee, the Class A Note Trustee and Class B Note Trustee are
each not liable for the failure by the Clearing Systems to deliver notices to Class B2 Noteholders in a timely manner.

In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and certain other Transaction Documents, the Issuer Security
Trustee and the Borrower Security Trustee each has various powers, authorities and discretions to agree to amendments to
certain provisions and to the taking of certain steps by the Obligors without the consent of the Borrower Secured Creditors or
the Issuer Secured Creditors (as applicable). See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement
_— Amendments, Consents and Waivers — General Procedures”._

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer Security Trustee
may concur with the Obligor Group Agent in making any amendment to give any consent under, or grant any waiver in
respect of, any breach or proposed breach which is not, in the opinion of the Borrower Security Trustee, materially prejudicial
to the interests of the Borrower Secured Creditors, or in the opinion of the Issuer Security Trustee (as applicable) is not
materially prejudicial to the interests of the Issuer Secured Creditors (and in the case of any Class B2 Noteholders in their
capacity as Issuer Secured Creditors, where the Class B Note Trustee is of the opinion that the relevant amendment, consent
or waiver is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class B2 Noteholders).

**_Regulatory initiatives may result in increased regulatory capital requirements and/or decreased liquidity in respect of the_**
**_Class B2 Notes._**

In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there has been increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the asset-backed
securities industry in recent years. This has resulted in numerous measures for increased regulation which are currently at
various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors
in certain securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to invest in securities issued under such
structures, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.

Class B2 Noteholders should consult their own advisers as to the consequences to, and effect on, them of the
application of Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (together “CRD”), Regulation (EU) No. 231/2013

64


-----

(the “AIFM Regulation”) and Article 254 of Regulation (EU) No. 35/2015 (the “Solvency II Regulation”), each as
implemented by their own regulator, to their holding of any Class B2 Notes. The Issuer is not responsible for informing Class
B2 Noteholders of the effects of the changes to risk-weighting which will result for investors from the adoption of CRD, the
AIFM Regulation and the Solvency II Regulation by their own regulator.

**_The Class B2 Notes will be new securities for which there is no established trading market._**

Application has been made to the Irish Stock Exchange for the Class B2 Notes to be admitted to the Official List
and trading on the Global Exchange Market. The Class B2 Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no
market. The Class B Global Coordinator and Arranger and the Joint Bookrunners may make a market in the Class B2 Notes as
permitted by applicable laws and regulations; however, the Class B Global Coordinator and Arranger is not obligated to make
a market in the Class B2 Notes and they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore,
Center Parcs cannot assure any investor as to the development or liquidity of any trading market for the Class B2 Notes. The
liquidity of any market for the Class B2 Notes will depend on a number of factors, including:

      - the number of Class B2 Noteholders;

      - the operating performance and financial condition of Center Parcs;

      - the market for similar securities;

      - the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Class B2 Notes; and

      - prevailing interest rates.

Historically, the debt capital markets have been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the
prices of securities similar to the Class B2 Notes. Center Parcs cannot assure investors that the market, if any, for the Class B2
Notes will be free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect the prices at which the
investors may sell the Class B2 Notes. Therefore, Center Parcs cannot assure investors that they will be able to sell the Class
B2 Notes at a particular time nor that the Class B2 Notes will receive a favourable price from such sale. Consequently,
investors in the Class B2 Notes should be aware that they may have to hold the Class B2 Notes until their maturity.

In addition, the market value of the Class B2 Notes may fluctuate with changes in prevailing rates of interest,
market perceptions of the risks associated with the Class B2 Notes, supply and other market conditions. Consequently, any
sale of Class B2 Notes by the Class B2 Noteholders in any secondary market which may develop may be at a discount to the
original purchase price of such Class B2 Notes.

**_Rating Agency assessments, downgrades and changes to Rating Agencies criteria may result in ratings volatility on the_**
**_Class B2 Notes._**

The ratings assigned to the Class B2 Notes by S&P and Fitch address the likelihood of full and timely payment to
the Class B2 Noteholders of all payments of interest due on each Note Interest Payment Date and the full repayment of
principal of the Class B2 Notes on or before the relevant final maturity date. There is no assurance that any such ratings will
continue for any period of time or that they will not be reviewed, revised, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the Rating
Agencies as a result of changes in or unavailability of information or if, in the Rating Agencies’ judgement, circumstances so
warrant. Rating organisations other than the Rating Agencies could seek to rate the Class B2 Notes and, if such “unsolicited
ratings” are lower than the comparable rating assigned to the Class B2 Notes by the Rating Agencies, such “shadow ratings”
could have an adverse effect on the value of the Class B2 Notes.

In addition, future events, including events affecting Center Parcs, could have an adverse impact on the ratings of
the Class B2 Notes (as to which, see “— Risks Relating to the Financing Structure — Sale of a Propco may have an adverse
_effect on the ability of the Borrowers to meet their obligations under the Loans and ultimately affect the repayments on the_
_Notes by the Issuer”.)_

Where a particular matter (including the determination of material prejudice by the Class B Note Trustee) involves
each of S&P and Fitch being requested to confirm that a proposed action would not result, in the case of S&P, in a downgrade
or a CreditWatch placement, or in the case of Fitch, in the downgrade of the then current rating of the Class B2 Notes, such
confirmation is given at the sole discretion of the relevant Rating Agency. Depending on the timing of delivery of the request
and any relevant information, there is a risk that the relevant Rating Agency cannot provide its confirmation in the time
available or at all. No Rating Agency will be responsible for the consequences of any failure to deliver a Ratings Assessment
or confirmation on any particular timescale.

Confirmation, if given, will be given on the basis of the facts and circumstances prevailing at the relevant time, and
in the context of cumulative changes to the transaction of which the Class B2 Notes form part since the Third Closing Date. A

65


-----

confirmation of ratings represents only a restatement of the opinions given at the Third Closing Date, and cannot be construed
as advice for the benefit of any parties to the transaction or as confirmation that an event or amendment is in the best interest
of, or not materially prejudicial to the interests of, the Class B2 Noteholders. No assurance can be given that a requirement to
seek a ratings confirmation will not have a subsequent impact upon the business of the Issuer.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Security Trustees will acknowledge that they do not
have any right of recourse to or against either Rating Agency in respect of a Ratings Assessment which either Security Trustee
relies upon.

Reliance by the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee on any Ratings Assessment will not create,
impose on or extend to either Rating Agency any actual or contingent liability to any person (including, without limitation, the
Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee and/or any Class B2 Noteholder) or create any legal relations between
Fitch and the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee, the Class A Global Coordinator and Arranger, the Class
B Global Coordinator and Arranger, the Joint Bookrunners, any Noteholder or any other person whether by way of contract or
otherwise.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or
withdrawal at any time by the assigning Rating Agency.

In respect of a disposal of a Propco or a holiday park owned by a Propco made pursuant to the Class A Issuer/
Borrower Loan Agreement, a Ratings Assessment is required to be obtained from each of S&P and Fitch. If either Rating
Agency delivers such a Ratings Assessment, such Ratings Assessment will be prepared and delivered by either Rating Agency
on the following limited basis:

(a) a Ratings Assessment will be a point-in-time assessment which:

(i) will not constitute a credit rating by either Rating Agency;

(ii) will not be monitored by either Rating Agency and therefore will not be updated to reflect
changed circumstances or information that may affect the Ratings Assessment; and

(iii) will not address other matters that may be of relevance to the Noteholders,

and such Ratings Assessment will be issued on the basis that the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower
Security Trustee and each Noteholder will be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed to the above
terms;

(b) none of the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee or any Noteholder will have any right
of recourse to or against either Rating Agency in respect of a Ratings Assessment which is relied upon by
the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee; and

(c) reliance by the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee on any Ratings Assessment will
not create, impose on or extend to either Rating Agency any actual or contingent liability to any person
(including, without limitation, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee and/or any
Noteholder) or create any legal relations between either Rating Agency and the Issuer Security Trustee,
the Borrower Security Trustee, the Class A Global Coordinator and Arranger, the Class B Global
Coordinator and Arranger, the Joint Bookrunners, any Noteholder or any other person whether by way of
contract or otherwise.

**_Definitive Notes not having denominations in integral multiples of the minimum authorised denomination may have_**
**_difficulty in trading in the secondary market._**

The Offered Notes have a denomination consisting of a minimum authorised denomination of £100,000 plus higher
integral multiples of £1,000 up to £199,000. Accordingly, it is possible that the Offered Notes may be traded in amounts in
excess of the minimum authorised denomination that are not integral multiples of such denomination. In such a case, if
Definitive Notes are required to be issued, a Class B2 Noteholder or an Exchangeable Noteholder who holds a principal
amount less than the minimum authorised denomination at the relevant time may not receive a Definitive Note in respect of
such holding and may need to purchase a principal amount of Offered Notes such that their holding amounts to the minimum
authorised denomination (or another relevant denomination amount).

If Definitive Notes are issued, Class B2 Noteholders and Exchangeable Noteholders should be aware that Definitive
Notes which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple of the minimum authorised denomination may be illiquid
and difficult to trade.

**_Offered Notes in book-entry form will be subject to the rules of Euroclear and Clearstream, respectively, which may not be_**
**_adequate to ensure the owners their timely exercise of rights under the Offered Notes._**

The Offered Notes will initially only be issued in global form and deposited with a common depository for
Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests in the Global Notes will trade in book-entry form only. The common depository, or its
nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream, will be the sole holder of the Global Notes. Accordingly, owners of book-entry
interests must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and non-participants in Euroclear or Clearstream must
rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interests, to exercise any rights and obligations of a
holder of Offered Notes.

Unlike the holders of the Offered Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to
act upon the Issuer’s or the Exchangeable Note Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from
holders of the Offered Notes. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to
ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Offered Notes.

**_Repayment of the Class B2 Notes in the event that the UK becomes a participating Member State in the European_**
**_Economic and Monetary Union._**

It is possible that, prior to the maturity of the Class B2 Notes, the United Kingdom may become a participating
Member State in the European Economic and Monetary Union and the euro may become the lawful currency of the United
Kingdom. In that event: (a) all amounts payable in respect of any Class B2 Notes denominated in sterling may become
payable in euro; (b) applicable provisions of law may allow or require the Issuer to re-denominate such Class B2 Notes into
euro and take additional measures in respect of such Class B2 Notes; and (c) the introduction of the euro as the lawful
currency of the United Kingdom may result in the disappearance of published or displayed rates for deposits in sterling used
to determine the rates of interest on such Class B2 Notes or changes in the way those rates are calculated, quoted and
published or displayed. It cannot be said with certainty what effect, if any, adoption of the euro by the United Kingdom would
have on investors in the Class B2 Notes.

**_Prepayment of the Class B2 Loan may negatively affect the projected yield to maturity of the Class B2 Notes._**

The yield to maturity of the Class B2 Notes will depend on, amongst other things, the amount and timing of
repayment and prepayment of principal on the Class B2 Loan and the price paid by the Class B2 Noteholders. Such yield may
be adversely affected by a higher or lower than anticipated rate of prepayment on the Class B2 Loan. The rate of prepayment
of the Class B2 Loan cannot be predicted and will be influenced by a wide variety of economic and other factors, including
prevailing interest rates, the buoyancy of the UK holiday centre market, the availability of alternative financing and local and
regional economic conditions. Therefore, no assurance can be given as to the level of prepayment that will be experienced.

**_Changes of law may have a negative impact on the ability of the Issuer or Exchangeable Note Issuer, as applicable, to_**
**_meet its payment obligations under the Offered Notes._**

The transactions described in this Offering Circular (including the issuance of the Offered Notes) and the ratings
which are to be assigned to the Offered Notes are based on the relevant law and administrative practice in effect as at the date
hereof, and having regard to the expected tax treatment of all relevant entities under such law and practice. It is possible that,
whether as a result of case law or through statute, changes in law or regulations, or their interpretation or application after the
date of this Offering Circular, may result in either the Issuer’s, the Exchangeable Note Issuer’s, Center Parcs’ or the Obligor
Group’s debt financing arrangements as originally structured no longer having the effect anticipated or which could have a
material adverse effect on the Issuer’s, the Exchangeable Note Issuer’s, Center Parcs’ or the Obligor Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations and/or could adversely affect the rights, priorities of payments and/or treatment of
holdings in Class B2 Notes of the Class B2 Noteholders or Exchangeable Notes of the Exchangeable Noteholders.

**_The Exchangeable Notes will not be listed or admitted to trading on any exchange._**

The Exchangeable Notes will not be listed or admitted to trading on any exchange. As a result, pricing information
for the Exchangeable Notes may be more difficult to obtain, and this may adversely affect the liquidity and, therefore, the
value of the Exchangeable Notes. In an illiquid market, you may be subject to the risk that you will not be able to sell your
holding of Exchangeable Notes at any time at fair market prices.

**_The Offered Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which_**
**_they may be sold._**

The Offered Notes have not been, nor will they be, registered under the securities laws of the United States or
elsewhere. The Offered Notes may not be publicly offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred in any jurisdiction where
registration may be required. In particular, sales and transfers of the Offered Notes are subject to restrictions and/or
certification requirements under the Securities Act as set forth in more detail under “Notice to Investors and Transfer
_Restrictions.” These restrictions may limit your ability to resell the Offered Notes. You should inform yourself of, and seek_
legal advice in relation to, applicable securities laws.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**The Acquisition**

On 2 June 2015, BSREP II Cayman Blocker Pooling L.P., or the Purchaser, an entity managed by affiliates of
Brookfield Asset Management Inc., entered into the Acquisition Agreement with CP Cayman Topco, CP MGMT Nominee
Limited and others, referred to herein as the Sellers, to acquire the entire issued share capital of CP MGMT Limited and CP
Cayman Midco 1 Limited (or, the Target Companies) and certain shares in the capital of Topco. The consummation of the
Acquisition pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement is not subject to any anti-trust, regulatory or other conditions and is
expected to occur on or prior to 3 August 2015 or such other date as CP Cayman Topco and the Purchaser agree (such date
being the Completion Date). The Acquisition Agreement contains customary closing obligations. If any party fails to comply
with such obligations, the Acquisition Agreement may be terminated by the non-defaulting party. The Purchaser assigned and
novated its rights and obligations under the Acquisition Agreement and other documents entered into in connection with the
Acquisition to BSREP II Center Parcs Jersey 2 Limited, or Bidco, an indirect subsidiary of the Purchaser.

In connection with the Acquisition, certain employees and members of management will reinvest part of their
shareholding in CP MGMT Limited in BSREP II Center Parcs Jersey Limited and, as of the Completion Date, we expect
certain employees and members of management will indirectly hold approximately 0.7% of the share capital of Bidco.

The Acquisition is being financed through a combination of the proceeds of the Exchangeable Notes offering,
which, pursuant to the terms of the Mandatory Exchange, will be mandatorily exchanged for the Class B2 Notes, to be issued
immediately following the consummation of the Acquisition, and by equity provided by the investors in the Brookfield Funds.

**The issuance of the Exchangeable Notes and the issuance and exchange of the Class B2 Notes**

The Exchangeable Notes are being offered in connection with the financing of the Acquisition and related
transactions and will be issued before the closing of the Acquisition. Pending the Completion Date, the gross proceeds from
the offering of the Exchangeable Notes, or Escrowed Funds, will be deposited into the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms
of the Escrow Agreement among, inter alios, the Exchangeable Note Issuer and the Escrow Agent dated as of the
Exchangeable Note Issue Date for the account of the Exchangeable Noteholders.

Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the Exchangeable Note Trust Deed, the Exchangeable Notes will
be exchangeable for the Class B2 Notes on the Third Closing Date, immediately following the consummation of the
Acquisition and upon issuance of the Class B2 Notes (or, the Mandatory Exchange Event). On the occurrence of the
Mandatory Exchange Event, the Exchangeable Notes will be automatically exchanged for an aggregate nominal amount of the
Class B2 Notes equal to the aggregate nominal amount of the Exchangeable Notes.

In the event that (i) the Mandatory Exchange does not occur on or prior to the Longstop Date of 30 November 2015,
(ii) the Purchaser announces its intention to abandon the acquisition or the Sellers having announced that they have decided to
sell the Target Companies or any of its direct or indirect parent entities or significant subsidiaries to an entity other than the
Purchaser or one or more of its affiliates, (iii) the Purchaser notifies the Exchangeable Note Trustee and the Escrow Agent
that in its reasonable judgment the Acquisition will not be completed by the Longstop Date, (iv) the Acquisition Agreement
terminates at any time on or prior to the Longstop Date, (v) the Purchaser ceases to beneficially own and control the majority
of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Exchangeable Note Issuer or (vi) certain insolvency defaults or events of
default occur on or prior to the Longstop Date, the Exchangeable Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption and
the Exchangeable Note Issuer will redeem all (but not some only) of the Exchangeable Notes at 100% of the aggregate issue
price together with accrued but unpaid interest to the date of such redemption. See “Terms and Conditions of the
_Exchangeable Notes” included in Annex A hereto for the full terms and conditions of the Exchangeable Notes and the_
Mandatory Exchange.

**Refinancing of the Original Class B Loan and repurchase of the Original Class B Notes**

The Center Parcs Group intends to refinance the Original Class B Loan granted by the Issuer to the Borrowers under
the Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement on the Third Closing Date. The Borrowers of the Class B2 Loan will
use part of the proceeds thereof to (a) repay the Original Class B Loan (including the payment of any prepayment premium
and any accrued and unpaid interest) or (b) to fund a tender offer for the Original Class B Notes as described below. On
20 July 2015, Bidco launched a tender offer to purchase or procure the purchase of the Original Class B Notes in full, together
with accrued interest up to the date of purchase. All of the Original Class B Notes properly tendered prior to the expiration of
the tender offer will be purchased by the Borrowers on the Third Closing Date. The remaining outstanding amount of Original
Class B Notes are expected to be redeemed thereafter. The Borrower will deliver to the Issuer the purchased Original Class B
Notes in satisfaction, prepayment and discharge of a pro rata portion of each Borrower’s liability under the Original Class B
Loan. The repayment of the Original Class B Loan and the purchase of the Original Class B Notes are referred to in this
Offering Circular as the Refinancing.

In connection with the Refinancing, Topco intends to declare and pay the Original Class B Note Dividend to Bidco
in an amount equal to the interest which would have accrued on the Original Class B Notes purchased on the Third Closing
Date from (and including) the Third Closing Date to (but excluding) the interest payment date falling on 28 August 2015.

The Acquisition, the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, the issuance and exchange of the Class B2 Notes, the
Refinancing and the payment of the Original Class B Notes Dividend are collectively referred to as the Transactions. The
issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, the issuance and exchange of the Class B2 Notes and the Refinancing are collectively
referred to as the Financing Transactions.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The estimated gross proceeds from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes will be approximately £560 million.
Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Exchangeable Notes, and pending the Acquisition, the gross proceeds
from the offering of the Exchangeable Notes will be deposited into the Escrow Account held in the name of the Exchangeable
Note Issuer. On the Third Closing Date, immediately prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, a portion of the proceeds
will be released from the Escrow Account to fund the cash consideration for the Acquisition. Immediately following the
Acquisition, the remainder of the Escrowed Funds will be released from the Escrow Account and the Exchangeable Notes will
be automatically exchanged for an equal aggregate principal amount of Class B2 Notes issued by the Issuer.

The proceeds from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes will be used for the following purposes:

a) the cash consideration for the Acquisition;

b) ultimately, the Refinancing;

and, in each case, for the payment of fees, costs and expenses related thereto.

The following table describes the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Transactions as at the
Third Closing Date. The actual amounts as compared with those set forth in the table and in the accompanying footnotes are
subject to adjustments and may differ at the date of completion of the Transactions depending on several factors, including
differences from the estimation of fees and expenses.

(2) The amounts of the Original Class A Facilities, Second Class A Facilities, Class B2 Facility and the Original Class B Facility do not
reflect unamortised deferred issue costs.

(3) Unamortised deferred issue costs represent unamortised financing transaction costs to be recognised in the income statement over the
remaining period of the borrowing using the effective interest method. The increase in unamortised deferred issue costs of £1.8 million
represents the estimated fees and expenses of £7.4 million associated with the Financing Transactions minus write-off of unamortised
deferred issue costs of £5.6 million related to the Original Class B Facility.

Center Parcs (Holdings 3) Limited, a member of the Center Parcs Group, to CP Woburn Holdco S.à r.l. in relation to part payment of the

thereon. The loan notes incur compound interest at a rate of 10% per annum and are redeemable on 15 May 2016. The £150.2 million
consists of principal of £113.8 million and the unpaid interest thereon. The £2.1 million consists of principal of £1.8 million and the
unpaid interest thereon. The loans accrue interest at a fixed rate of 12% per annum and 8% per annum, respectively, and are repayable
on 28 February 2022. The £49.9 million of unsecured loan notes incur compound interest at a rate of 10% per annum and are
redeemable on 11 June 2025. These loans and loan notes owed to related parties are expected to be settled as part of the Financing
Transactions.

presented and related combination adjustments. The movement in total invested capital of £43.7 million relates to the write-off of
unamortised deferred issue costs of £5.6 million related to the Original Class B Facility and £65.6 million related to the capitalisation of

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The financial information of CPUK Finance Limited is consolidated within the consolidated financial information
of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma combined financial information is based on the
financial information as of and for the 52-week period ended 23 April 2015 of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited.

As at 23 April 2015, Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and CP Woburn Opco did not constitute a combined group.
As a result, consolidated financial statements have not historically been prepared for Center Parcs as a consolidated group.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information set out in this section has been prepared to illustrate the
effects of the Woburn Acquisition and Accession and the Class A Notes Refinancing on the income statement of Center Parcs
(Holdings 1) Limited for the 52-week period ended 23 April 2015 had the aforementioned occurred on 25 April 2014 and to
illustrate the effect of the Woburn Acquisition and Accession and the Class A Notes Refinancing on the statement of net
assets of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited as at 23 April 2015 had the aforementioned occurred on 23 April 2015. See
“Selected Consolidated Financial Information” and “Presentation of Financial Information”. The Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Information does not reflect the impact of the Acquisition or the Financing Transactions on the trading or
financial position of either Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited or CP Woburn Opco for the period presented.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that CPUK
Finance Limited believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information,
which has been produced for illustrative purposes only, by its nature addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does
not represent Center Parcs’ actual financial position or results. The unaudited pro forma statement of net assets and income
statements are compiled on the basis set out in the notes below. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information does
not constitute financial statements within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act.

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The financial information of CPUK Finance Limited is consolidated within the consolidated financial information of Center Parcs
(Holdings 1) Limited. Accordingly, the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information adjusts the consolidated financial information
of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited for the period presented.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information does not reflect any trading or results of either Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited
or CP Woburn Opco since 23 April 2015.

The acquisition of Woburn will be accounted for following the principles of predecessor accounting in accordance with IFRS, whereby an
acquirer is not required to be identified and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts. As a result, the Unaudited Pro
Forma Combined Financial Information does not reflect acquisition adjustments in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’.

**Note 1** The financial information has been extracted without material adjustment from the consolidated financial statements of Center
Parcs (Holding 1) Limited for the 52-week period ended 23 April 2015 included elsewhere in this Offering Circular.

**Note 2** The financial information has been extracted without material adjustment from the financial statements of CP Woburn Opco for
the 52-week period ended 23 April 2015 included elsewhere in this Offering Circular.

**Note 3** There are no combination adjustments to the pro forma income statement for the 52-week period ended 23 April 2015.

The adjustment to the net asset statement as at 23 April 2015 reduces the value of property, plant and equipment held by CP
Woburn Opco by £8.5 million, being the profit on disposal recognised by the Center Parcs (Holding 1) Limited group on the sale
of the Woburn site to CP Woburn Opco in February 2012. The site was transferred at market value. Other combination
adjustments relate to intercompany balances of £9.7 million in relation to tax group relief and costs recharged in accordance with a
management services agreement which are also eliminated on combination.

-----

The combination adjustments to net off deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities by £7.2 million relate to accelerated capital
allowances, with the asset in the Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited Group being partially offset by the liability in CP Woburn
Opco. Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited’s unsecured loan notes of £119.7 million issued by CP Comet Holdings Limited are
reclassified from trade and other payables to current borrowings on combination.

**Note 4** The pro forma adjustment represents the incremental finance expense on a pro forma basis resulting from the issuance of the
Second Class A Notes as if the Class A Notes Refinancing had occurred on 25 April 2014. The pro forma adjustments to finance
expense of £6.9 million consist of the finance expenses related to the Second Class A Notes, interest expense on the unsecured
loan notes owed to a related party, less finance expenses charged on the repayable existing Class A Notes and CP Woburn Opco
Facility. The unsecured loan notes owed to a related party relate to £49.9 million which was the part payment of the purchase price
CP Woburn Opco.

The tax impact on the change in finance expenses is calculated at the corporate tax rate of 21%, being the rate applicable for the
52-week period ended 23 April 2015.

**Note 5** The increase in borrowings of £73.1 million relates in part to the Second Class A Notes of £490.0 million (offset by transaction
fees and expenses of £8.2 million) used to repay the Class A1 Facility of £300.0 million and CP Woburn Opco Facility of £158.6
million. The remaining increase relates to £49.9 million consideration payable for the acquisition of CP Woburn Opco recognised
as an amount owed to a related party presented within non-current borrowing.

The remaining cash of £23.2 million from the Second Class A Notes is used for the make-whole payment and accrued interest in
respect of the Class A1 Facility of £23.3 million, with the shortfall of £0.1 million being paid from existing cash and cash
equivalents.

The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of £90.7 million is the £0.1 million shortfall plus the cash consideration payable upon
the acquisition of CP Woburn Opco of £90.6 million. Total consideration for the acquisition of CP Woburn Opco is
£140.5 million, which includes the £49.9 million consideration paid by the related party loan notes.

**Note 6** The following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Profit for the period, in
each case on a pro forma combined basis for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2015. See also “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined

(1) Center Parcs defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to remove the effects of owners’ costs and certain exceptional and nonunderlying items that Center Parcs believes are not indicative of its underlying operating performance. Exceptional and other nonunderlying items comprise Woburn pre-opening losses and other exceptional and non-underlying items. Woburn pre-opening losses
relate losses incurred during the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2013, the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2014 and the 8 weeks ended 19 June 2014
in respect of Woburn Village. Woburn opened to guests on 6 June 2014, but did not operate at full capacity until after 19 June 2014.
Other exceptional and non-underlying items relate to, among other things, costs incurred in respect of the Blackstone Funds’ exit from
Center Parcs.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualised Adjusted EBITDA are not measures under IFRS and investors should not consider
EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as alternatives to (a) operating profit or profit/(loss) for the period as a measure of Center Parcs’
operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of Center Parcs’ ability to meet its
cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance under IFRS. Investors should evaluate each adjustment and the reasons Center
Parcs considers it appropriate as a method of supplemental analysis. In evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualised
Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that, as an analytical tool, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualised Adjusted
EBITDA are each subject to certain limitations. See “Presentation of Financial Information — Non-IFRS Financial Measures”. In
addition, investors should be aware that Center Parcs is likely to incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation in the
future and that certain of these items could be considered recurring in nature. Center Parcs’ presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and
Annualised Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. For further information, see the discussions on exceptional items in the Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited financial
statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Circular.

(2) Cost of sales and administrative expenses for the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2014 have been restated in the audited consolidated financial
statements for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2015 in order to more accurately reflect the nature of expenses incurred by Center Parcs
(Holdings 1) Limited. Costs of £53.0 million have been transferred from Administrative expense to Cost of sales, principally in respect
of payroll costs. This restatement has no impact on Adjusted EBITDA or Operating profit.

Cost of sales and administrative expenses for the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2013 have been restated throughout this Offering Circular
from the audited consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited for the same period in order to present the
financial information on a consistent basis across the historical financial periods.

(3) Exceptional finance expense represents the accelerated amortisation of deferred issue costs relating to the Class A1 Notes to reflect the
Class A Notes Refinancing.

**OVERVIEW**

Center Parcs is a leading UK short-break holiday business, attracting approximately 2 million guests in financial
year 2015. Center Parcs operates five specially constructed holiday villages in the United Kingdom: Sherwood Forest in
Nottinghamshire, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Elveden Forest in Suffolk, Whinfell Forest in Cumbria (or the Original
Villages) and the more recent addition of Woburn Village in Bedfordshire, which opened to guests on 6 June 2014. Each
village is set in a forest environment amongst approximately 400 acres of forest around a lake and is open 365 days per year.

Woodland, water and a natural environment are the essential elements of a Center Parcs break. Within this
comfortable, quiet, car-free and family-friendly setting, each of the Center Parcs villages provides guests with high quality
accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. In total, there are 4,127 units of accommodation across its five
villages, which can accommodate 21,712 guests per day at 100% occupancy. The focal point and key attraction of each
village is an all-weather indoor sub-tropical swimming paradise, featuring a selection of water activities including a wave
pool, river slides and rides, children’s pools and jacuzzis. Center Parcs’ on-site experiences also include outdoor activities
such as cycling, boating and zip wires; indoor activities such as ten-pin bowling, badminton and pottery; and amenities such
as spas, food and beverage and retail. A significant proportion of Center Parcs’ revenue is generated from guests’ on-site
spending, including for leisure and spa activities, food and beverage and retail, representing 41% of total revenue in financial
year 2015.

Center Parcs has a well-established brand in the UK for providing high quality experiences and facilities and targets
a primary guest base of affluent families. Center Parcs benefits from strong guest loyalty with approximately 35% of guests
returning within 14 months and approximately 60% returning over a five-year period. In addition, Center Parcs believes that
its business model is difficult to replicate due to the lack of suitable locations for the development of holiday parks and high
development costs and Center Parcs is well positioned to continue to grow its business. In March 2015, Center Parcs was
named “Best UK Family Holiday Provider” in the Tommy’s Awards for the twelfth year in a row, in addition to receiving a
Globe Travel Award in 2015, “Investor in People” accreditation in 2013 and retaining its “Hospitality Assured” Premier status
in 2014, achieving the highest score in its sector.

Center Parcs’ villages typically draw on a regional population of guests who are attracted to the convenience of
being within a relatively short driving distance from home. Over 80% of the UK population lives within a 2.5 hour drive of at
least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two hour drive of the village they
choose to visit. Center Parcs believes that the proximity of the majority of guests to its villages combined with the easy
accessibility of the villages by car make Center Parcs a popular and convenient holiday option. Occupancy levels at Center
Parcs’ Original Villages have been consistently high: 97.2% in each of financial years 2013 and 2014 and 97.5% in financial
year 2015. Occupancy levels have averaged over 94% in the last 15 years and approximately 97% in the last five years despite
the expansion of existing accommodation offerings at Center Parcs’ Original Villages and the recent opening of Woburn
Village. Woburn Village achieved 95% occupancy in the 40 weeks ended 23 April 2015 following a short ramp-up period
since opening to guests on 6 June 2014.

For the financial year 2015, on an unaudited pro forma combined basis, giving effect to the Woburn Acquisition and
Accession, Center Parcs had revenue of £386.9 million and Annualised Adjusted EBITDA of £186.1 million, representing an
Annualised Adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.1%. For a reconciliation of Annualised Adjusted EBITDA to loss/profit see
“Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information”.

Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are broadly evenly split amongst Center Parcs’ villages (including Woburn),
reflecting both the individual strength of each village and the diversity of Center Parcs’ asset base.

**KEY FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

**Revenue and other key performance indicators**

**_Revenue_**

Center Parcs’ revenue is principally comprised of accommodation revenue generated from holidays at Center Parcs’
accommodation, and on-site revenue, comprised of amounts received predominantly from the sale of food and beverages,
retail items, leisure activities and spa-related activities. The combined total of accommodation and on-site revenue is a key
indicator of the overall performance of the business. Accommodation revenue is recognised when the holiday commences,
and on-site revenue is recognised at the point the guest undertakes the relevant activity or receives the relevant service.

Advance payments for accommodation and pre-booked activities are recorded as payments on account within trade
and other payables until the holiday commences. Revenues are primarily driven by occupancy levels and pricing.

**_Occupancy_**

Center Parcs measures occupancy as the average number of units of accommodation occupied as a percentage of the
total number of units of accommodation available, including those units that are off-line for refurbishment.

Occupancy is a key driver of both accommodation and on-site revenue. Higher levels of occupancy generally result
in greater volumes of on-site purchases, reflecting the increased number of guests. Center Parcs’ business is generally
characterised by high occupancy rates, and achieved occupancy rates of 97.2%, 97.2% and 97.5% in the financial years 2013,
2014 and 2015, respectively. Woburn’s occupancy was 94.1% for the 44 weeks ended 23 April 2015, with the relatively lower
occupancy level reflecting the start-up period in connection with its opening to guests on 6 June 2014.

**_Average Daily Rate_**

One of the key performance indicators Center Parcs uses to help measure and maximise its yield is ADR which
calculated as the average rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total accommodation income for the period divided by the
total number of accommodation nights sold. Due to yield management adjustments, ADR can vary substantially between low
and peak periods.

ADR for Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited for the financial year 2015 was £153.90, compared with £153.67 and
£148.36 for financial years 2014 and 2013, respectively. ADR for CP Woburn Opco for the 44-week period ended 23 April
2015 was £192.19. The opening of Woburn Village has contributed to a lower increase in ADR at the Original Villages
compared to previous years. This has mainly been the case for the southern villages of Longleat and Elveden, being the
villages closest to Woburn.

Improvements in ADR have reflected primarily inflationary price increases, improved mix of accommodation
following refurbishment and upgrades (relating to the increased amount of higher quality accommodation) as well as yield
management improvements. From financial year 2010 through financial year 2015, ADR for the Original Villages grew at a
CAGR of 3.1%, in part due to refurbishments and mix in accommodation.

**_RevPAL_**

RevPAL is the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on the total accommodation income divided by
the total available number of accommodation nights. RevPAL can also be calculated as ADR multiplied by occupancy.

RevPAL for Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited for the financial year 2015 was £150.1, compared with £149.38 and
£144.22 for financial years 2014 and 2013, respectively. RevPAL for CP Woburn Opco for the 44-week period ended
23 April 2015 was £180.94. The scale of the increases in RevPAL over the years primarily reflects those factors discussed for
ADR above. Center Parcs’ management believe RevPAL to be a meaningful indicator of performance, and RevPAL takes into
account both occupancy and ADR.

**_Net on-site spend per lodge night_**

Net on-site spend per lodge night is calculated as on-site spend at Center Parcs-operated units and the rent received
from concession partners (i.e. on-site revenue) for a period divided by the sum of the number of guest-occupied lodges during
each night of such period. Center Parcs’ management believes on-site spend per lodge night to be a meaningful indicator of
performance, as it takes into account both occupancy and on-site revenue. Net on-site spend per lodge night for the Original
Villages for financial year 2015 was £109. Net on-site spend per lodge night for CP Woburn Opco for the 44-week period
ended 23 April 2015 was £129.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

This measure reflects an adjustment to EBITDA by removing the effect of owners’ costs and certain exceptional
items which management believes are not indicative of Center Parcs’ underlying operating performance. See “Presentation of

£140.0 million, £146.8 million and £147.7 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA for CP Woburn Opco for the 44-week
period ended 23 April 2015 was £32.5 million.

**_Yield Management and Pricing_**

Center Parcs applies “yield management” strategies to maximise revenue levels throughout the year. It actively
adjusts its pricing throughout the 104 available three and four day “breaks” in each year to reflect the seasonal and other
fluctuations in demand. Center Parcs uses ADR and RevPAL to measure its yield management. It has a dedicated pricing
team that monitors advance bookings and adjusts prices for accommodation during the year according to expected guest
demand. The yield management strategies have achieved high occupancy rates; in the last 15 years, Center Parcs’ occupancy
rates have averaged approximately 94% at the Original Villages.

In contrast to accommodation prices, on-site prices have generally been more stable over the year as these prices
have not been subject to pricing and yield management. However, Center Parcs is currently rolling out and further developing
a programme of enhanced differentiation in pricing. Through the programme, prices of various on-site offerings are expected
to become more flexible across villages or seasons to more accurately reflect guest demand. On-site prices are also reviewed
and increased to reflect inflation.

**_Advance bookings_**

Center Parcs places a strong emphasis on advance bookings, with an average of 16 weeks booking-to-arrival time,
which results in significant revenue and cashflow visibility. Advance bookings measures the percentage of accommodation
available during a financial year that have been booked at the beginning of that financial year.

Center Parcs holidays are available for booking starting from either 15 months or 18 months in advance of the
scheduled stay date, depending on when in the year the booking is made. Center Parcs collects 30% of the accommodation
cost at the time of booking if the booking is made more than ten weeks in advance of the holiday, with the balance of the cost
collected ten weeks prior to the start of the break that has been booked. If a guest books less than ten weeks prior to the arrival
date, the accommodation cost is payable in full on booking and cannot be refunded upon cancellation. Leisure activities
available at the villages can be pre-booked and pre-paid prior to arrival. Guests can only pre-book leisure activities if they prepay and in such cases a cancellation policy applies. If guests cancel pre-booked leisure activities more than 24 hours before
the start of the activity, they will incur a 5% charge. Within 24 hours of the start of the activity, cancellations will incur a 75%
charge.

For each of the financial years 2013, 2014 and 2015, an average of 40% of the available accommodation nights at
the Original Villages had been booked by the beginning of that financial year. For the financial years 2015, 2014 and 2013,
approximately 60% of leisure and spa activities were pre-booked and pre-paid prior to arrival.

**Operating costs**

Center Parcs’ principal operating costs are cost of sales, village overheads and central overheads. In addition, Center
Parcs benefits from having a flexible cost base. For the purposes of its audited combined financial statements, village
overheads and central overheads are treated as ‘administrative expenses’. The following table sets forth cost of sales, village
overheads and central overheads for Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited for the periods indicated:

**52 weeks ended** **52 weeks ended** **52 weeks ended**

(1) In financial year 2015, Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also had exceptional operating costs of £6.3 million. These are one-off costs
in respect of the Blackstone Funds’ exit from Center Parcs. Additional costs will be presented in respect of financial year 2016 as the
Blackstone Funds’ exit from Center Parcs was not complete as at 23 April 2015.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales represents variable direct expenses incurred from revenue-generating activities, primarily expenses of
food and beverages and retail merchandise and associated payroll costs. These costs generally vary with changes in revenue,
as well as inflation and commodity prices. Center Parcs continually evaluates and renegotiates supply agreements centrally
and aims to apply best practices, such as improving the supplier tender process, taking advantage of promotional offers and
re-negotiating key costs in a timely manner, throughout the group.

Center Parcs utilises visibility of forward bookings to optimise the efficiency of personnel across the village by
matching staffing levels to expected demand in various areas of its business.

The largest cost within village overheads is in respect of personnel costs, which are subject to annual pay increases.

Center Parcs seeks to manage other village overheads through actively managing costs by benchmarking each of its
villages against each other in order to strive to achieve “best in class”.

**_Central Overheads_**

The primary components of central overheads for Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited are set forth in the table below:

**52 weeks ended** **52 weeks ended** **52 weeks ended**
**25 April 2013** **24 April 2014** **23 April 2015**

Marketing costs are primarily incurred in connection with marketing and advertising campaigns through all media
channels. Center Parcs seeks to manage the cost of its marketing campaigns through the use of cost-efficient marketing
channels such as internet advertising and targeted emails to contacts in its guest database. Marketing campaigns are planned
annually with a significant concentration around the peak booking season of late December to late February. All marketing
costs with respect to the five villages have been incurred by Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited. Marketing costs in respect of
Woburn Village incurred by Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited, together with other shared service costs, are recharged to CP
Woburn Opco within “other costs” pursuant to a management services agreement.

**Depreciation and Amortisation**

Depreciation and amortisation is comprised of depreciation of leasehold improvements, installations, fixtures and
fittings and motor vehicles and hardware, and amortisation of software and other intangible assets. Depreciation for Center
Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited for financial year 2015 was £30.6 million, compared with £28.8 million and £25.4 million for
financial years 2014 and 2013, respectively. Amortisation of intangible assets for Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited for
financial year 2015 was £2.0 million, compared with £2.2 million and £1.8 million for financial years 2014 and 2013,
respectively.

**Debt and financing costs**

Finance costs comprise interest paid on outstanding debt and loans, primarily bank debt (primarily from drawdowns
relating to the financing of Woburn Village, as well as the associated VAT facility), secured bonds and loans from related
parties together with the amortisation over the life of the secured bonds of deferred costs incurred in the raising of finance.

**Economic conditions in the United Kingdom**

While Center Parcs has performed resiliently during both downturns and recoveries, which has resulted in Center
Parcs’ occupancy levels averaging approximately 94% in the last 15 years and approximately 97% in the last five years,
demand for its products and services is sensitive to disposable income levels and holiday length and destination preferences of
its guests, which is linked to general economic conditions in the United Kingdom. Weak economic conditions may result in a
decline in the number of guests and a decrease in on-site spending. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Center Parcs’
_Business and Industry — Center Parcs’ business is currently located entirely in England. As a result, changes in the UK_
_holiday market may have a more significant adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of_
_operations than on more geographically diverse holiday businesses”._

-----

**Seasonality**

Center Parcs’ operations are subject to seasonal factors, as pricing varies significantly depending on the time of
year. Center Parcs’ prices are highest during peak demand periods, which include the main holiday periods at Easter, the
summer holidays and the Christmas/New Year period, along with school half terms. Center Parcs’ revenues and operating
costs are therefore also typically highest during such peak demand periods. Occupancy rates, however, remain relatively
unchanged throughout the year, as Center Parcs’ online dynamic pricing encourages demand outside of the peak periods.
Ahead of the peak demand periods, the peak booking season occurs in late December to late February, and Center Parcs plans
a significant concentration of its marketing campaigns around this time.

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**

**Refinancing of the Class A1 Loan and the redemption of the Class A1 Notes**

On 11 June 2015, the Center Parcs Group refinanced the Class A1 Loan granted by the Issuer to the Borrowers on
the Closing Date under the Original Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. The Borrowers of the Class A1 Loan fully
prepaid the Class A1 Loan (together with accrued interest on the Class A1 Loan up to the Second Closing Date and an amount
equal to the Class A make-whole payment due in respect of the Class A1 Notes) using £323 million of the proceeds of the
Second Class A Loans granted by the Issuer to the Borrowers on the Second Closing Date under the Class A Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement. The Issuer used the proceeds of the repayment of the Class A1 Loan to fund the corresponding redemption
of the Class A1 Notes. The repayment of the Class A1 Loan and the corresponding redemption of the Class A1 Notes are
referred to in this Offering Circular as the “Class A Notes Refinancing”. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial
_Information”, “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of Other Indebtedness”._

**Acquisition of CP Woburn Opco**

In November 2010, Center Parcs received reserved matters planning approval of its plan to develop and build a fifth
village situated near Woburn in Bedfordshire. In 2012, new corporate entities, including CP Woburn Opco and its holding
company, CP Woburn Holdco, were established outside of the Obligor Group to facilitate the ownership, development and
financing of Woburn Village. The development of Woburn Village was completed and, on 6 June 2014, Woburn Village
opened to guests.

Concurrently with the Class A Notes Refinancing, Center Parcs (Holdings 3) Limited acquired the entire issued
share capital of CP Woburn Opco from CP Woburn Holdco and CP Woburn Opco acceded to the Class A Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement and the other Transaction Documents as a Borrower and an Obligor (the “Woburn Acquisition and
Accession”). On the Second Closing Date and in connection with the Woburn Acquisition and Accession, (a) Center Parcs
(Holdings 3) Limited borrowed £19 million of the proceeds of the Second Class A Notes from the Issuer and used such funds
towards the purchase price for the shares in CP Woburn Opco and (b) CP Woburn Opco borrowed £142 million of the
proceeds of the Second Class A Notes from the Issuer to repay its existing loan facility.

Following the completion of the Woburn Acquisition and Accession, the business of CP Woburn Opco may be
reorganised to transfer the business and operation of Woburn Village to CP Opco and to transfer the legal title in the property
for Woburn Village to another Obligor (the “Reorganisation”). If the Reorganisation takes place, it will involve, among other
things, transfers of shares, properties and leases between certain members of the Center Parcs Group and the novation of the
indebtedness incurred by CP Woburn Opco under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement to other members of the
Center Parcs Group. If undertaken, the Reorganisation will not have any impact on the financing structure or the security
package for the Class B2 Notes.

**Trading Update**

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited’s results of operations for the 8 weeks ended 18 June 2015 have been in line with
management’s expectations.

Forward bookings for the Original Villages are ahead of the prior year, with 58.9% of the capacity for financial year
2016 booked as of 16 July 2015 (as compared to 54.9% as of 17 July 2014 in financial year 2015). ADR for the first trading
quarter (being the first twelve weeks) of financial year 2016 was marginally ahead of the ADR for the first trading quarter of
financial year 2015, reflecting a modest impact from the opening of Woburn Village. As of 16 July 2015, ADR for forward
bookings for the Original Villages for the final 40 weeks (representing the last three trading quarters) of financial year 2016
indicates a level of ADR growth comparable to that prior to the opening of Woburn Village.

Occupancy for Woburn Village for the first trading quarter of financial year 2016 is in line with that for the Original
Villages. For the remaining three trading quarters of financial year 2016, forward bookings for Woburn Village are in line
with such bookings for the same period in the prior financial year (representing the trading quarters in financial year 2015
when Woburn Village was fully operational).

**Financial Year 2015 compared with Financial Year 2014**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue increased by £5.0 million or 1.6% during the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2015, in comparison to the 52
weeks ended 24 April 2014. This improvement was principally driven by a 3.3% increase in on-site revenue.

Average occupancy showed a marginal increase from 97.2% to 97.5%, a record level of occupancy for the business.
The average number of units of accommodation was 3,421 during the year ended 23 April 2015, which was unchanged from
the prior year. The number of guests visiting the Original Villages during the year was approximately 1.7 million, a similar
number to the prior year.

As anticipated, the opening of Woburn during the year had an impact on ADR growth at the Original Villages, with
ADR growth of 0.1% from financial year 2014 to financial year 2015. The impact was principally observed in the southern
villages, Elveden and Longleat, with a more limited impact at Sherwood and no apparent impact at Whinfell.

The increase in ADR, combined with the maintenance of the Group’s historically high levels of occupancy, is a
strong result given the increase in capacity created by the opening of Woburn. The small rise in ADR, combined with the
increase in occupancy, resulted in a RevPAL increase of 0.4% to £150.01.

Revenue growth was seen at three villages during the year, with Elveden showing a small reduction. As expected,
given its location, Elveden has seen a modest impact on ADR and RevPAL following the opening of Woburn. In addition,
Elveden had strong comparatives following the opening of the iconic ‘Tropical Cyclone’ water ride and the subsequent uplift
in ADR in financial year 2014.

Whinfell, being the village furthest away from Woburn and therefore the least affected, recorded the highest
percentage increase in revenue; this was despite having more units of accommodation off-line for upgrade than in the prior
year.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales of £86.5 million for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2015 was marginally higher than the prior year
(£84.3 million), with the increase reflecting the increase in on-site revenue and an increase in personnel costs.

**_Administrative expenses_**

Administrative expenses, excluding exceptional items, were £85.4 million in the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2015, an
increase of £1.9 million or 2.3% in comparison to the prior year. This rise was mainly as a result of increases in personnel and
energy costs.

Exceptional administrative expenses of £6.3 million in the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2015 were non-recurring costs
incurred in respect of the Blackstone Funds’ exit from Center Parcs. Some further costs will be presented for financial year
2016 as the Blackstone Funds’ exit from Center Parcs was not complete as at 23 April 2015.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

As a result of the factors outlined above, Adjusted EBITDA grew by £0.9 million or 0.6% in comparison to the
prior year.

**_Depreciation and amortisation_**

Depreciation and amortisation increased by £1.6 million during the year, driven by the ongoing significant levels of
capital expenditure in recent years, particularly in respect of accommodation upgrades.

**_Movement in fair value of financial derivatives_**

The movement in the fair value of financial derivatives of £16.8 million (2014: £nil, 2013: £nil) relates to the option
to repay the Original Class B Loan prior to maturity. The fair value is estimated with reference to the yields of similar
corporate bonds with comparable terms and credit ratings. The movement in the fair value has been recognised as an
exceptional/non-underlying item in the income statement.

**_Finance costs and income_**

At the year-end, Center Parcs accelerated the amortisation of deferred debt issue costs in respect of the A1 tranche
of the securitised debt, in light of the imminent refinancing of those notes. Other than this additional charge of £4.3 million,
finance costs are broadly in line with the comparative period, principally representing interest payable on the Group’s secured
debt and loans from related parties. Finance income represents bank interest receivable.

85


-----

**_Taxation_**

The tax charge of £2.5 million represents amounts payable to a related party in respect of group relief received in
the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2015.

**Financial Year 2014 compared with Financial Year 2013**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue increased by £11.1 million, or 3.7%, during the 52-week period ended 24 April 2014, in comparison to the
52-week period ended 25 April 2013. This increase was driven by an improvement in ADR, which increased by 3.6% in the
52-week period ended 24 April 2014, combined with an increase in on-site spend driven by Center Parcs’ investment in new
leisure activities. The increase in ADR is due to inflationary price increases, the benefits of increased yield from upgraded
accommodation, flexible pricing booking model and yield management. RevPAL also increased 3.6% to £149.38 as a result
of the increased ADR and stable occupancy levels.

Average occupancy remained stable at 97.2%. The average number of units of accommodation was 3,421 during the
52-week period ended 24 April 2014, which was unchanged from the prior year. The total number of guests visiting Center
Parcs during the year was approximately 1.7 million, a similar number to the prior year.

Revenue growth was seen at all Original Villages during the year, with Elveden Forest recording the highest growth
of 5.1%. This in part reflects the full year benefit from the continuing success of the “Tropical Cyclone” water ride and other
upgraded facilities in the swimming pool areas which were introduced at Elveden Forest during the prior year.

Revenue growth at Longleat Forest was adversely impacted by the village having a significant number of units of
accommodation off-line as part of the accommodation upgrade programme. Conversely, Whinfell Forest had no units of
accommodation off-line for upgrades during the year and hence saw strong growth in occupancy.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales of £84.3 million for the 52-week period ended 24 April 2014 were £0.9 million higher than the prior
year (£83.4 million), principally as a result of increases in personnel costs.

**_Administrative expenses_**

Administrative expenses were £83.5 million for the 52-week period ended 24 April 2014, an increase of
£3.4 million in comparison to the prior year. This rise was mainly due to increases in insurance costs.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

As a result of the factors outlined in “Revenue”, “Cost of Sales” and “Administrative expenses” above, Adjusted
EBITDA grew by £6.8 million, or 4.9%, in comparison to the prior year. Consistent with the revenue trends, all villages saw
increased Adjusted EBITDA, with Whinfell Forest achieving the largest percentage increase of 6.9%.

**_Depreciation and amortisation_**

Depreciation and amortisation increased by £3.8 million, or 14% during the 52-week period ended 24 April 2014,
driven by the on-going significant levels of capital expenditure in recent years, particularly on upgrading our accommodation.

**_Finance costs and income_**

Finance costs are broadly similar to the prior financial year, principally representing interest payable on Center
Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited’s secured debt and loans from related parties. Finance income represents bank interest receivable.

**_Taxation_**

The tax charge of £4.0 million for Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited for the 52-week period ended 24 April 2014
represents group relief to a related party offset by a smaller deferred tax credit largely in respect of fixed asset timing
differences. The net credit position of £0.6 million of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited for the 52-week period ended
25 April 2013 arose due to deferred tax timing differences.

**CP Woburn Opco**

Consolidated financial statements for Center Parcs, including Woburn Village, will be prepared in the first
accounting period following 23 April 2015.

The income statement for the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2013 has not been included above as the only expenditure related to pre-opening and
finance costs, and the only income related to finance income. Woburn Village opened to guests on 6 June 2014.

**44-week period ended 23 April 2015**

**_Introduction_**

Woburn Village opened to paying guests on 6 June 2014, following a three-week period of trial breaks to nonpaying guests which started on 16 May 2014. As a consequence the results have been split into two periods based on Center
Parcs’ accounting periods each consisting of four weeks:

      - the 8-week period to 19 June 2014, covering the final phase of the development build, the trial break period
and a short initial period when Woburn Village was open to paying guests. This is not representative of any
on-going trading performance of Woburn Village; and

      - the 44-week period from 20 June 2014 to 23 April 2015, when Woburn Village was open to paying guests.
Center Parcs believes that this is the most meaningful period to assess performance and consequently the
discussion below focuses on this 44-week period.

The following discussion does not provide any comparison to prior periods, as the only income in those periods
related to finance income and the only expenditure related to pre-opening and finance costs.

**_Build-up period_**

Center Parcs incurred approximately £250 million of development costs in respect of Woburn Phase 1. As planned,
Center Parcs gradually built up occupancy levels during June and July of 2014 whilst Woburn Village became fully
operational. As a consequence, occupancy of 84.1% for the first four weeks of the 44-week period to 23 April 2015 was
below the levels typically expected of a fully operational village.

Pursuant to a management services agreement, shared services costs, including marketing and personnel expenses,
are incurred by Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited for Center Parcs and then recharged to CP Woburn Opco as appropriate.

**_Overview_**

Overall the performance of CP Woburn Opco has been in line with Center Parcs’ expectations. The impact of the
opening of Woburn Village on the performance of the Original Villages has been limited and resulted in a lower increase in
ADR in the Original Villages compared to previous years, whilst occupancy levels have remained unchanged.

This discussion compares certain key performance metrics of Woburn Village for this 44-week period against such
metrics of the Original Villages for the 52-week period ended 23 April 2015. Although the periods compared vary in terms of
length of time, Center Parcs believes that the comparison is a useful indicator of the relative performance of Woburn Village
as against the Original Villages.

87


-----

**_Revenue_**

Revenue for the 44-week period ended 23 April 2015 totalled £65.6 million. This includes a slightly higher
proportion of accommodation income than at the Original Villages. This mainly reflected a higher ADR at Woburn Village
driven by the improved mix of accommodation (relating to the increased amount of higher quality accommodation) and the
proximity to London in comparison to the Original Villages, partially offset by a lower ADR at Woburn Village from
November through the Christmas period, when the Original Villages offered the “Winter Wonderland” festive season
experience that had yet to be introduced at Woburn Village. ADR for the 44-week period was £192.19 and occupancy was
94.1%, resulting in RevPAL of £180.94.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales for the 44-week period ended 23 April 2015 of £16.8 million resulted in a gross margin of 74.4%,
slightly higher than for the Original Villages, benefitting from the higher ADR relative to the Original Villages discussed
above with broadly comparable cost base.

**_Administrative expenses_**

Administrative expenses of £16.3 million for the 44-week period ended 23 April 2015 represented 24.8% of total
revenue, a slightly lower proportion of revenue than for the Original Villages mainly as a result of the higher ADR achieved at
Woburn, partially offset by higher village overheads per unit of accommodation at Woburn as a result of the village being
smaller and not benefitting as much from the economies of scale as the Original Villages.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

Adjusted EBITDA of £32.5 million for the 44-week period ended 23 April 2015 resulted in an Adjusted EBITDA
margin of 49.5% and mainly reflects the benefits of a higher level of ADR.

**_Depreciation and amortisation_**

Depreciation and amortisation of £7.8 million during the 44-week period ended 23 April 2015 reflects the charge
from when Woburn Village opened on 6 June 2014 to the end of the period under review.

**_Finance costs and income_**

Finance costs for the 44 weeks ended 23 April 2015 totalled £19.4 million, representing interest payable on CP
Woburn Opco’s bank debt and loans from related parties. In the prior year, virtually all interest payable was capitalised as part
of the Woburn build programme.

**_Taxation_**

The underlying net tax charge of £4.7 million for the 44 weeks to 23 April 2015 consists of a current tax credit in
respect of payment received from a related party for tax losses surrendered, offset by a deferred tax charge in respect of the
utilisation of brought forward pre-trading losses and fixed asset timing differences.

The exceptional and non-underlying tax charge of £3.1 million for the 8 week period to 19 June 2014 consists of a
tax credit arising in respect of the pre-opening trading loss for this period offset by a prior year deferred tax adjustment in
respect of tax deductible capitalised interest and financing fees.

**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited’s principal uses of cash have been operating expenses, capital expenditure and
debt service. Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited has historically funded operations and capital expenditure with cash flow
from operations. As at 23 April 2015, Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited had cash and cash equivalents of £84.8 million, and
negative working capital of £96.2 million. As at 23 April 2015, CP Woburn Opco had cash and cash equivalents of
£19.2 million, and negative working capital of £14.6 million. Working capital is defined as the net value of Center Parcs’
combined inventories, trade and other receivables and current trade and other payables (excluding taxation creditors and
capital and interest accruals).

CP (Woburn Operating) Limited has historically funded its operations and capital expenditure through its credit
facility and related party loans.

Following the Class A Notes Refinancing and the Transactions, Center Parcs expects to continue to meet its
working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations. Center Parcs
may also, from time to time, seek other sources of funding, which may include debt or equity financings depending on its
financing needs and market conditions.

**Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **28.7** **58.2** **84.8**

Net cash from operating activities was £147.4 million, £146.2 million and £140.9 million in financial year 2015,
2014 and 2013, respectively. The primary reason for the increase of £1.2 million, or 0.8%, in cash flows from operating
activities for financial year 2015 as compared with financial year 2014 was the movement in working capital, and in particular
an increase in payments on account, offset by the lower operating profit. The primary reasons for the increase in cash flows of
£5.3 million, or 3.8%, from operating activities for financial year 2014 as compared with financial year 2013 were mainly
related to the increase in operating profit.

Net cash used in investing activities was £41.2 million, £36.7 million and £42.0 million in financial year 2015, 2014
and 2013, respectively. The fluctuation in spend principally reflects the timing of Center Parcs’ accommodation upgrade
programme which accelerated in financial year 2013.

Net cash used in financing activities was £79.6 million, £80.0 million and £81.9 million in financial year 2015, 2014
and 2013, respectively. Cash used in financing activities for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2015, the 52 weeks ended 23 April
2014 and the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2013 predominantly relates to the payment of interest on the Center Parcs Group’s
existing secured debt.

(1) Includes £3.5 million and £3.9 million in financial year 2014 and financial year 2015 in relation to Longleat dome upgrade.

Center Parcs plans expenditure for the development of villages, amenities and facilities, both in respect of upgrading
and refurbishing existing accommodation and facilities, building new units of accommodation and adding new facilities and
amenities. Maintenance capital expenditures include refurbishments to existing facilities, including ensuring that health and
safety standards are met and investment capital expenditures include building new accommodation; upgrading existing
accommodation and upgrading, adding or extending cafes, restaurants and other facilities.

Capital investments are organised and planned annually around significant, regular planned maintenance and capital
expenditure that is intended to maintain high occupancy levels and drive revenue growth through improved appeal of
accommodation units, facilities and amenities.

89


-----

The capital refurbishment programme of Center Parcs’ accommodation units can be broken into two distinct
investment cycles within a 16- to 20-year period:

      - _Refurbishment: approximately every eight to ten years, each unit needs to be refurbished to maintain Center_
Parcs’ targeted standards, which typically ensures existing levels of ADR are maintained; and

      - _Upgrade: following the refurbishment cycle there is typically a further eight to ten years before a unit is_
upgraded, which includes a full refurbishment of the unit and also an upgrade of the standard to add new
features and to modernise the style of the unit. Historically, ADR achieved on upgraded accommodation has
typically been between 10% and 20% higher than the equivalent non-upgraded accommodation as measured by
sampled upgraded lodges compared against the equivalent non-upgraded lodges during financial years 2012 to
2014.

Although investment capital expenditure increases during the investment phase of a refurbishment or upgrade
programme, profit margins and operating profit generally increase in the years following completion of the investment
programmes as guests demand higher-end or upgraded accommodation.

The covenants under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement require the Obligors to spend a minimum of
£18.5 million per year in relation to maintenance capital expenditure. Total capital expenditure for Center Parcs (Holdings 1)
Limited was £39.9 million, £39.6 million and £40.8 million for financial years 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. In addition,
following the completion of the build-up phase of Woburn, CP Woburn Opco spent £2.0 million on maintenance capital
expenditure and £0.1 million on investment capital expenditure in financial year 2015. Historically, changes in capital
expenditure have been driven primarily by amounts spent on investment capital expenditure (including accommodation
upgrades) with underlying maintenance capital expenditure remaining relatively stable. To date, Center Parcs, through its
capital expenditure programme to upgrade accommodation across its villages, has upgraded approximately 84% of total
accommodation stock, driving continued growth in ADR. Center Parcs currently expects its capital expenditure to increase
significantly in financial years 2016 and 2017 due to its investment in Project Atlantis and the Digital Roadmap. In addition,
planned upgrades to villages include upgrades of 52 and 34 units of accommodation at Sherwood Village and Whinfell
Village, respectively, at a cost of approximately £3 million for each village.

**Working capital**

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited has negative working capital requirements largely arising from the payment by
guests for their short breaks in advance of arrival. Center Parcs’ trade receivables are primarily composed of corporate sales
made through its Corporate Events division and inventories primarily composed of stock in Center Parcs retail and food and
beverage outlets. Center Parcs’ trade and other payables primarily relate to advance accommodation income received from
guests, trade creditors, accrued expenditure and VAT and payroll taxes due.

Center Parcs has historically funded working capital requirements through cash generated from operations. There is
a degree of seasonality in the working capital requirements linked to accommodation revenue receipts.

Payments held on account have historically been at their lowest level after the Christmas period and prior to the key
booking period of late December to late February and at the end of each calendar year. This contrasts with the significantly
higher payments held on account typically seen in April or in advance of the summer holiday season.

Management anticipates that working capital requirements in the foreseeable future will generally be stable as a
percentage of revenue. However, these requirements can fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including those factors set forth
under “Risk Factors”.

Depending upon its rate of growth and profitability, Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited may require additional
equity or debt financing to meet working capital requirements or capital expenditure needs. There can be no assurance that
additional financing, if needed, will be available when required or, if available, on terms satisfactory to Center Parcs
(Holdings 1) Limited.

**Contractual commitments**

Center Parcs has no material contractual commitments with the exception of the headleases on the Longleat and
Woburn properties. The total current annual rental on these leases are approximately £0.7 million and £0.6 million,
respectively, and the lease termination dates are 22 February 2073 and 23 December 2109, respectively. The rent in respect of
each lease is subject to review every five years, based on any increase in revenue.

**Off-balance sheet arrangements and contingent liabilities**

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited has no off-balance sheet arrangements or contingent liabilities.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market and Credit risks**

**_Market risks_**

_General economic conditions_

The disposable income of Center Parcs guests and/or their holiday preferences are and will be affected by changes
in the general economic environment and this may result in a fall in the number of guests and/or a decrease in on-site spend.
Center Parcs regularly reviews its product offering and engages with guests to ensure it provides value for money to meet
guest needs. In addition, resilient performance through economic cycles, during both downturns and recoveries, has resulted
in Center Parcs’ occupancy levels averaging over 94% in the last 15 years and approximately 97% in the last five years.

_Competition_

The Center Parcs brand is synonymous with high quality short breaks in a forest environment but Center Parcs
competes for the discretionary expenditure of potential guests, who could choose to take short breaks at other destinations or
participate in other recreational activities. Center Parcs believes that this risk is mitigated by the strength of the Center Parcs
brand and the continual investment in the accommodation and facilities (including retail and restaurants), coupled with the
innovation amongst the leisure activities and the responsiveness to guest preferences (from surveys).

_Seasonality and weather_

Demand for short breaks is influenced by the main holiday periods at Easter, the summer holidays, school half-term
holidays and the Christmas/New Year period. This risk is mitigated by online dynamic pricing which encourages demand
outside of the peak periods. The accommodation is located within forest environments and a significant number of activities
take place outdoors. Therefore, demand may be impacted by the prevailing weather conditions. This risk is minimal because
the vast majority of breaks and activities are booked in advance and guests tend not to book on impulse. Additionally, Center
Parcs maintains diversity between its indoor and outdoor activities to mitigate the risk of inclement weather.

**_Financial risks_**

The Directors and senior managers regularly review the financial requirements of the Group and the associated
risks. Center Parcs does not use complicated financial instruments and where financial instruments are used they are used to
reduce interest rate risk. Center Parcs does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. Center Parcs finances its
operations through a mixture of retained earnings and borrowings as required. Historically, Center Parcs has sought to reduce
its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring its funding using the underlying asset value.

_Interest rate risk_

Principal sources of borrowings are fixed interest rate loan notes and fixed interest rate related party loans.

_Liquidity risk_

Center Parcs maintains sufficient levels of cash to enable it to meet its medium-term working capital and debt
service obligations. Rolling forecasts of liquidity requirements are prepared and monitored, and surplus cash is invested in
interest bearing accounts.

_Currency risk_

Whilst no borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies, a number of suppliers are exposed to the euro and the
U.S. dollar. Wherever possible Center Parcs enters into supply contracts denominated in Sterling. Center Parcs does not
operate a hedging facility to manage currency risk as it is not considered to be material.

_Credit risk_

Cash balances are held on deposit with a number of UK banking institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with
respect to trade receivables are limited due to the vast majority of guests paying in advance.

**Critical accounting policies**

The following accounting policies are considered to be pertinent to this review of Center Parcs’ operating and
financial results.

_Revenue recognition_

Revenue relates to accommodation income on holidays commenced during the period, together with other related
income that primarily arises from on-site leisure and spa related activities, retail and food and beverage spend. On-site
revenue is recognised when the related product or service is provided. All revenue is recorded net of VAT.

91


-----

Payment for accommodation income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded as ‘payments
on account’ within trade and other payables until the holiday commences.

A number of trading units on each holiday village are operated by concession partners. Revenue due in respect of
such units is recognised on an accruals basis.

All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.

_Property, plant and equipment_

Center Parcs carries property, plant and equipment at cost rather than current valuation. As such, no increases in the
value of Center Parcs’ property, plant and equipment are recognised in the financial statements. Any impairment to the
carrying value of these assets is recognised in the income statement under “Administrative expenses”.

_Maintenance expenditure_

It is the policy of Center Parcs to maintain its land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance expenditure
increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to generate, this expenditure is capitalised. All other
maintenance costs are charged to the income statement under administrative expenses as incurred unless they relate to the
head office, in which case they are charged to the income statement under administrative expenses as incurred.

_Borrowings_

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

**INDUSTRY**

**Overview of the UK Holiday Market**

The UK holiday market is defined as the market for UK residents holidaying in the UK (domestic but excluding
Northern Ireland) and UK residents holidaying internationally (overseas).

Based on Mintel’s analysis of Office for National Statistics data, the recent challenging economic environment saw
the total volume of holidays taken by UK residents decrease from 95.9 million in 2008 to an estimated 93.8 million in 2014,
primarily due to a decrease in international holidays by UK residents over the period. However, total expenditure increased
from £36.4 billion in 2008 to an estimated £38.1 billion in 2014. The performance of the UK domestic market, in which
Center Parcs is present, was resilient during the economic downturn. It grew by 8.6% in volume of domestic holidays over the
same period, driving a total increase of 22.4% in domestic expenditures from 2008 to 2014, as compared to a 14.3% and 3.1%
decline in the volume and value, respectively, of overseas holidays. Consequently, the UK domestic market has grown at a
CAGR of 1.4% in terms of volume and 3.4% in terms of value in the period between 2008 and 2014, while the overseas
market has decreased at a CAGR of 2.5% and 0.5%, respectively, during the same period. Furthermore, Mintel expects the
domestic market to continue to grow between 2014 and 2019 at a 3.1% CAGR in terms of value.

Center Parcs operates in the UK holiday centres market, which consists of three segments: (a) traditional holiday
centres; (b) holiday parks centred around caravan or lodge accommodation; and (c) forest villages. These sub-segments of the
holiday market are described later on in this section.

**_UK Holiday Centre Market Trends_**

The key trends impacting the UK holiday centres market include the following:

_Economic Environment and Outlook_

According to Mintel, the UK economy is recovering to pre-crisis levels, a trend which is expected to impact
favourably upon the overall holiday market. As the macroeconomic situation recovers and the pound gains strength compared
to the euro, the UK domestic market may face the threat of stronger competition from overseas holidays. However, there has
been a steady rise in consumer confidence as a result of the recovering macroeconomic conditions and declining inflation in
the UK, which is likely to boost the holiday market overall. Additionally, there is a growing trend towards shorter holidays.
This shorter holiday trend is particularly favourable to Center Parcs, whose guests are attracted by the convenience of being
within a relatively short driving distance from home.

_Change in Guests: Socio-Economic Profile_

According to Mintel, changes in socio-economic groups (“SEG”) and in particular the growth in the ABC1
category have historically benefited the holiday market and are likely to continue to do so in the medium term. SEGs are
based on the chief income earner and are defined as follows:

**SEG** **Occupation of Chief Income Earner**

A . . . . . Higher managerial, administrative or professional

B . . . . . Intermediate managerial, administrative or professional

C1 . . . . Supervisory or clerical and junior managerial, administrative or professional

C2 . . . . Skilled manual workers

D . . . . . Semi and unskilled manual workers

E . . . . . Entirely dependent on the state long term, through sickness, unemployment, old age or other reasons

With high standards and expectations for their holidays, the ABC1 SEGs form the core target customer base for
Center Parcs. An increase in the number of ABC1 SEGs among the UK population grows Center Parcs’ potential guest base.

According to Mintel, as of 2012, AB SEGs represented over 26% of the UK adult population, with forecasts
showing this demographic segment continuing to grow. As of 2012, the ABC1 segment as a whole represented over 50% of
the UK population. This demographic segment is expected to remain the largest segment of the UK population.

_Changes in Demographics_

According to Mintel, growth in demand for holiday centres in the UK is expected to be positively affected by
demographic changes, including in particular the rise in the number of families with young children. The number of children
aged nine years and under is expected to increase by 5.1% between 2014 and 2019 from 7.9 million in 2014 to 8.3 million in
2019.

In addition, an increasing number of young adults (25-34 year olds), from an estimated 9.0 million in 2014 to a
forecast 9.5 million in 2019 (an increase of approximately 6.0%), is expected to increase the birth rate beyond 2015.
According to Mintel, this will likely benefit the UK holiday centre market as it increases the number of prime target guests,
namely families, for holiday centres in the United Kingdom in the short to medium term.

_Multiple Holiday Taking and Trend Towards Shorter Breaks_

The trend towards shorter breaks remains steady with the UK short break market being far more stable over the past
five years than the UK domestic market as a whole. According to Mintel, the average length of UK domestic holidays has
decreased continuously during the last six years from 3.80 (2007) to 3.48 days (2013). Short breaks comprising between one
to three nights account for almost two-thirds of the total UK domestic tourism market.

According to Mintel, a growing number of consumers expect to supplement their main holiday with extra trips
throughout the year. Almost half of those who holidayed domestically during the year took two or more trips, reflecting the
large proportion of short one to three-night domestic breaks. This trend is expected to create significant opportunities for
holiday centres, which are positioned as one of the strongest short-break propositions. This is expected to drive demand for
Center Parcs’ offering as a short-break family-focused holiday provider. Further, in the UK domestic market, expenditure per
night is by far the highest for short breaks; at £100 per night for one to three night stays, it is almost double the expenditure
per night for 4+ night holidays as a whole.

**Overview of the UK Holiday Centres Market**

According to Mintel, the UK holiday centres market has grown year on year between 2007 to 2012 in terms of both
volume and value, increasing from 6.3 million holidays in 2007 to an estimated 7.0 million in 2012 (a 2.2% CAGR) as a result
of growth in the domestic holiday market as well as an increasing preference for holiday centres as a domestic holiday
destination. As a result, the UK holiday centres market increased in value at a 4.9% CAGR from £1.2 billion in 2007 to an
estimated £1.6 billion in 2012, compared to UK nominal gross domestic product growth of 2.3% during that period for the
UK. According to Mintel, the holiday centres market is expected to be worth £1.8 billion by value and will see 8.0 million
visitors in 2017, representing a 3.0% and 3.2% CAGR from 2013 to 2017, respectively.

**_Market Segmentation and Product Offering_**

While Center Parcs believes that it has a unique product offering, it is sometimes considered to be part of the UK
holiday centres market. The UK holiday centres market which, according to Mintel, accounted for approximately 12% and

94


-----

11% of the UK domestic holiday market in volume and value, respectively, as of 2012, is divided into three distinct segments:
(a) traditional holiday centres; (b) holiday parks (large caravan/chalet parks offering an extensive range of holiday centre
facilities); and (c) forest villages (also considered as holiday centres but aimed more at rural quiet rather than holiday bustle).
These segments compete with each other to a certain extent within the UK holiday centres market. However, while traditional
holiday centres and holiday parks tend to be coastal sites, dominated by guests mainly from the C1-C2 socio-economic
category, forest villages are based in woodland sites and attract mainly ABC1 families looking for active forest village breaks
and premium lodge park accommodation.

According to Mintel, almost half of all people who have visited a holiday centre in the past or indicated that they
would like to do so in the future ranked an indoor pool among the most preferred amenities when visiting a holiday centre,
with popularity peaking among ABC1s and families. The focal point of Center Parcs’ villages is its sub-tropical swimming
paradise which together with Center Parcs’ premium product offering (accommodation, leisure activities, food and beverage,
retail and spa) underpins the attractiveness of the Center Parcs’ concept for ABC1 guests.

_Traditional holiday centres comprise the traditional brands such as Butlins, Warner and Pontins (a smaller UK_
operator), which were originally based on a 1950s “holiday camp” formula. They have evolved over time (now fewer in
number and individually larger in scale) and have invested significantly in recent years in improving their accommodation and
range of activities. These traditional centres are generally in beach locations and therefore tend to primarily complement a
family beach holiday. They are characterised by permanent accommodation (rather than mobile homes) in blocks or detached
buildings. Their offering may be full board or self-catering, but generally includes free family-oriented entertainment, variety
shows and leisure facilities, such as swimming pools, amusement arcades, fairground-type rides and outdoor sports facilities,
such as five-a-side football, a climbing wall and crazy golf.

95


-----

_Holiday parks constitute the largest sector within the UK holiday centres market, both by number of locations and_
volume of holidays sold and comprise brands such as Parkdean Holidays, Park Resorts, Haven and Hoseasons. However,
within the holiday park segment, it is difficult to distinguish between what are essentially larger caravan parks with few
facilities, and those parks with amenities and activities that are sophisticated enough to be categorised as a traditional holiday
centre. As consumer expectations increase, there is more demand for holiday parks to provide a greater range of value-added
services such as pools, restaurants, children’s clubs and entertainment. Holiday parks can cater for customers looking for three
types of services: (a) hiring mobile homes or fixed caravans; (b) purchasing these mobile homes; and (c) hiring space for
towed caravans and tent campers. Although they vary considerably in size, holiday parks are generally smaller in scale than
the traditional holiday centres. Holiday parks are often situated in coastal locations, often in scenic areas and primarily target
C1-C2 and below SEGs.

_Forest villages differ from traditional holiday centres and holiday parks which are part of the tradition of the British_
seaside holiday. Forest villages are based inland, in woodland and water settings, with an explicitly environmental ethos (a
car-free, family-friendly environment), marketed primarily and explicitly to affluent family groups in the ABC1 SEGs, as
compared with the broader targeting of the traditional holiday centres. The accommodation in forest villages is permanent and
generally more spacious than traditional holiday centres. Forest village accommodation provides self-catering facilities and
open-plan living, with luxurious top-end accommodation standards. The focus is activity-based, with a wide range of sporting,
creative and spa/therapeutic activities geared towards both adults and children. Unlike most traditional holiday centres, which
include a wide range of entertainment and activities as part of the basic holiday package, forest village holiday providers offer
a customised approach and charge extra for individual activities. Furthermore, forest villages operate 365 days per year,
offering guests a high quality experience under all types of weather through a wide range of indoor and outdoor activities and
amenities.

**BUSINESS**

**Business Overview**

Center Parcs is a leading UK short-break holiday business, attracting approximately 2 million guests in financial
year 2015. Center Parcs operates five specially constructed holiday villages in the United Kingdom: Sherwood Forest in
Nottinghamshire, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Elveden Forest in Suffolk, Whinfell Forest in Cumbria (or, the Original
Villages) and the more recent addition of Woburn Village in Bedfordshire, which opened to guests on 6 June 2014. Each
village is set in a forest environment amongst approximately 400 acres of forest around a lake and is open 365 days per year.

Woodland, water and a natural environment are the essential elements of a Center Parcs break. Within this
comfortable, quiet, car-free and family-friendly setting, each of the Center Parcs villages provides guests with high quality
accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. In total, there are 4,127 units of accommodation across its five
villages, which can accommodate 21,712 guests per day at 100% occupancy. The focal point and key attraction of each
village is an all-weather indoor sub-tropical swimming paradise, featuring a selection of water activities including a wave
pool, river slides and rides, children’s pools and jacuzzis. Center Parcs’ on-site experiences also include outdoor activities
such as cycling, boating and zip wires; indoor activities such as ten-pin bowling, badminton and pottery; and amenities such
as spas, food and beverage and retail. A significant proportion of Center Parcs’ revenue is generated from guests’ on-site
spending, including for leisure and spa activities, food and beverage and retail, representing 41% of total revenue in financial
year 2015.

Center Parcs has a well-established brand in the UK for providing high quality experiences and facilities and targets
a primary guest base of affluent families. Center Parcs benefits from strong guest loyalty with approximately 35% of guests
returning within 14 months and approximately 60% returning over a five-year period. In addition, Center Parcs believes that
its business model is difficult to replicate due to the lack of suitable locations for the development of holiday parks and high
development costs and Center Parcs is well positioned to continue to grow its business. In March 2015, Center Parcs was
named “Best UK Family Holiday Provider” in the Tommy’s Awards for the twelfth year in a row, in addition to receiving a
Globe Travel Award in 2015, “Investor in People” accreditation in 2013 and retaining its “Hospitality Assured” Premier status
in 2014, achieving the highest score in its sector.

Center Parcs’ villages typically draw on a regional population of guests who are attracted to the convenience of
being within a relatively short driving distance from home. Over 80% of the UK population lives within a 2.5 hour drive of at
least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two hour drive of the village they
choose to visit. Center Parcs believes that the proximity of the majority of guests to its villages combined with the easy
accessibility of the villages by car make Center Parcs a popular and convenient holiday option. Occupancy levels at Center
Parcs’ Original Villages have been consistently high: 97.2% in each of financial years 2013 and 2014 and 97.5% in financial
year 2015. Occupancy levels have averaged over 94% in the last 15 years and approximately 97% in the last five years despite
the expansion of existing accommodation offerings at Center Parcs’ Original Villages and the recent opening of Woburn
Village. Woburn Village achieved 94.1% occupancy in the 44 weeks ended 23 April 2015 following a short ramp-up period
since opening to guests on 6 June 2014.

For the financial year 2015, on an unaudited pro forma combined basis, giving effect to the Woburn Acquisition and
Accession, Center Parcs had revenue of £386.9 million and Annualised Adjusted EBITDA of £186.1 million, representing an
Annualised Adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.1%. For a reconciliation of Annualised Adjusted EBITDA to loss/profit see
“Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information”.

Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are broadly evenly split amongst Center Parcs’ villages (including Woburn),
reflecting both the individual strength of each village and the diversity of Center Parcs’ asset base.

**History of the Center Parcs Group**

The Center Parcs concept was pioneered by Piet Derksen in the late 1960s in the Netherlands as a new form of selfcatering, high-comfort holiday village, complemented with heated bungalows, open fires, central heating, colour TVs and
covered swimming pools. Derksen expanded the chain over the course of the following two decades into Belgium, France and
Germany, and, in 1987, the first Center Parcs opened in the United Kingdom at Sherwood. The first British village was
closely followed by a second at Elveden in 1989. In 1994, Center Parcs further expanded with the creation of the third village,
Longleat, near Bath. In 2001, Center Parcs acquired the Oasis Holiday Village (now called Whinfell) in the northwest of
England from the Bourne Leisure Group, thus enhancing Center Parcs’ geographic footprint in the UK.

The Blackstone Funds bought the operating business in May 2006 and subsequently delisted it from the London
Stock Exchange where it had been listed on the AIM in 2003 and on the Main Market in 2005. Shortly thereafter, Blackstone
Funds purchased the property companies owning the four Original Villages in June 2006. The overall combined business was
refinanced in December 2006 and February 2012, with a partial refinancing in June 2015.

Since 2006, Center Parcs has implemented programmes to upgrade accommodation and to upgrade and expand onsite offerings. In November 2010, Center Parcs received reserved matters planning approval of its plan to develop and build a
fifth village situated near Woburn in Bedfordshire. The development of Woburn Village commenced in May 2012 and opened
to guests on 6 June 2014 as planned. In June 2015, Woburn Village acceded to the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement
and other Transaction Documents as a Borrower and an Obligor.

In June 2015, the Brookfield Funds agreed to acquire Center Parcs from the Blackstone Funds.

**Key Strengths**

**_Unique, market-leading short break holiday business._**

Center Parcs believes that it provides a unique product in the UK holiday market in terms of scale, quality and
standard of accommodation and amenities. Center Parcs is a market leader with an approximate 20% market share of the UK
holiday centres market in 2013. Each Center Parcs village is set in approximately 400 acres of forest around a lake, with
numerous retail and food and beverage offerings, as well as approximately 150 leisure and spa related activities and an indoor
sub-tropical swimming paradise. Each village has on average 825 lodges with capacity for 4,300 guests. Center Parcs believes
that it is the only large-scale UK business offering this type of family-focused, year-round, all-weather, short-break package,
in a forest environment.

**_Difficult to replicate concept with well-known brand and loyal, affluent customer base._**

The Center Parcs villages are characterised by a number of qualities that Center Parcs believes make its business
model difficult to replicate in the United Kingdom. These include:

      - limited appropriate sites for villages, which require large forested areas near major population centres;

99


-----

- long lead time needed to develop new villages due to the stringent requirements for obtaining planning permits;

- significant initial investment cost in addition to on-going capital expenditure required for further development
and operations of the business; and



      - a wide range of specialised operations and planning expertise required to develop and operate a village.

Center Parcs’ unique product offering has generated strong brand recognition and guest loyalty. Center Parcs
believes that it has high brand recognition in the UK and is considered among the top brands for high quality short breaks in
the UK.


Center Parcs’ “intention to return” score was 95% in financial year 2015. Approximately 35% of Center Parcs’
guests return within 14 months and approximately 60% return over a five-year period. Its active guest base grew to
approximately 460,000 households in 2015.

Center Parcs is also an award-winning brand, having recently been named “Best UK Family Holiday Provider” in
the Tommy’s Awards for the twelfth year in a row, in addition to receiving Globe Travel Award in 2015, “Investor in People”
accreditation in 2013 and retaining its “Hospitality Assured” Premier status in 2014, achieving the highest score in its sector.


Center Parcs’ guest profile has remained stable over time and consists of the highest earning categories of the UK
population. According to management estimates, 84% of guests are identified under the ACORN classification as “affluent
achievers”, “rising prosperity” or “comfortable communities” based on postcode analysis.

**_Resilient growth through economic cycles._**


Resilient performance through economic cycles, during both downturns and recoveries, and also through additions
in capacity, has resulted in Center Parcs’ occupancy levels averaging over 94% in the last 15 years and approximately 97% in
the last five years, with occupancy levels at the Original Villages of 97.2%, 97.2% and 97.5% in 2013, 2014 and 2015,
respectively. Woburn Village achieved 94.1% occupancy in the 44 weeks ended 23 April 2015 following a short ramp-up
period since opening to guests on 6 June 2014.

Occupancy Units of Accommodation

High occupancy levels drive a significant proportion of revenue from guests’ on-site spending, which represented
41% of Center Parcs’ total revenue in financial year 2015.


ADR for Center Parcs’ Original Villages on average also consistently grew above inflation between financial year
2004 and financial year 2015, at a CAGR of 3.6%. During this period, growth in Center Parcs’ RevPAL outpaced inflation by
1.7 times and UK RevPAR by four times. The growth in Center Parcs’ ADR has been driven by yield management initiatives,
demand and on-site investment, including in new types of accommodation and upgrades to existing accommodation.

**_Unbroken revenue growth with strong visibility through forward-booking model._**

Center Parcs has experienced revenue growth each year over the last ten years, with revenue growing at a CAGR of
6.1% from financial year 2004 to financial year 2015. In addition, Center Parcs’ Adjusted EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of
8.8% from financial year 2004 to financial year 2015. Center Parcs places a strong emphasis on advance prepaid bookings,
which result in significant revenue visibility, with an average of 16 weeks booking-to-arrival time. For each of the financial
years 2013, 2014 and 2015, an average of 40% of the available accommodation nights at its Original Villages had been
booked by the beginning of the financial year, an average of 56.6% by the end of the first quarter, an average of 76.9%
halfway through the financial year, and an average of 95% two months before the end of the financial year.

Center Parcs collects 30% of the accommodation cost at the time of booking if completed more than ten weeks in
advance of the short break. The balance of the cost is collected ten weeks prior to the start of the break. If a guest books less
than ten weeks prior to the arrival date, the accommodation cost is payable in full on booking. Similarly, in financial year
2015, approximately 60% of leisure and spa activities were pre-booked and pre-paid prior to arrival. This significant revenue
visibility allows Center Parcs to optimise its cost structure according to anticipated occupancy levels and demand throughout
the year.

**_Sustainable cash flow generation._**

Center Parcs’ EBITDA margins have been underpinned by high occupancy levels and consistent growth in ADR.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins for the Original Villages grew significantly over the past ten years from 35.2% and
45.5%, respectively, in financial year 2004 to 43.6% and 46.2%, respectively, in financial year 2015. Relatively high
EBITDA margins combined with the negative working capital characteristics of the business due to its forward-booking
model and the relatively low maintenance capital expenditure requirements, which averaged £18 million per financial year
from financial year 2007 to financial 2015, has enabled Center Parcs to be highly cash generative, with an average free cash
flow margin (defined as EBITDA less total capital expenditure divided by revenue) of approximately 30% from financial year
2013 to financial year 2015.

**_Well-invested, diversified and high quality asset base._**

Center Parcs owns all five of its villages on either freehold titles or long leasehold titles, and with remaining lease
terms of between 58 years and 984 years, Center Parcs’ asset base has a long life and is diversified and stable. Revenue and
EBITDA are broadly evenly split amongst its villages, located in different parts of the UK, reflecting both the individual
strength of each village and the diversity of Center Parcs’ asset base.

Center Parcs has an on-going capital expenditure programme to maintain and enhance the quality of its asset base,
pursuant to which it has invested approximately £388 million at the Original Villages from financial year 2007 through
financial year 2015. Of this investment, £159 million represents maintenance capital expenditures. The remainder represents
investment capital expenditure, of which £139 million was invested to upgrade existing accommodation (historically, ADR
achieved on upgraded accommodation has typically been between 10% and 20% higher than the equivalent non-upgraded
accommodation as measured by sampled upgraded lodges compared against the equivalent non-upgraded lodges during
financial years 2012 to 2014), £34 million was invested to build new developments and £56 million went toward on-site
development, including new leisure activities, food and beverage offerings and facilities upgrades. In addition, Center Parcs
has incurred approximately £250 million of total initial development costs in respect of building Woburn Village (“Woburn
**Phase 1”).**

**_Experienced management team with a track record of innovation._**

Center Parcs has an experienced management team with a proven ability to execute its business plans and achieve
results. In addition, Center Parcs’ management team has a track record of innovation reflected in its yield management
initiatives, innovation in on-site activities and food and beverage offerings, as well as development of new types of
accommodation to help drive ADR. Most recently, the management team successfully opened Woburn Village on time and on
budget. For the 44 weeks ended 23 April 2015, Woburn Village achieved an ADR of approximately 25% above the average of
the Original Villages. Woburn Village reached 95% occupancy within the first full quarter of trading since opening to guests
on 6 June 2014. With an average length of service of over ten years by individual members of its management team, the
management team is highly experienced in providing the services that set Center Parcs apart from other UK leisure and
holiday providers. We also expect to benefit from the operational expertise, relationships, and management experience of the
Brookfield group.

**Strategy**

**_Continue to grow revenue through yield management, flexible pricing, targeted marketing and customer relationship_**
**_management._**

Center Parcs actively manages pricing across its villages to maintain its high level of occupancy and to optimise
yield during periods of high demand. 100% of bookings are made directly with Center Parcs, with approximately 83% of
accommodation bookings made online in financial year 2015. Together with its strong emphasis on advance bookings
(average 16-week booking-to-arrival time period), this provides Center Parcs with significant operational information,
allowing it to respond quickly to customer trends in order to optimise its pricing. Center Parcs plans to continue to develop its
yield management and flexible pricing structure to further grow revenue, and to develop its customer relationship
management initiatives to increase demand from the affluent families that form its core guest base.

Center Parcs is investing in its systems to improve its digital capabilities, with the aim of optimising revenue growth
through the Digital Roadmap process. Through this process, Center Parcs plans to introduce more sophisticated pricing tools
in order to increase demand through improved customer relationship management and targeted marketing. Center Parcs’ guest
database of approximately one million contacts allows it to undertake targeted marketing campaigns using a range of
channels, including direct mailings, online and digital marketing, television campaigns and email programmes focused on
existing customers. The Digital Roadmap comprises revenue optimisation tools to create automated price suggestions and
intra-day price changes, the creation of data hubs to enable Center Parcs to better target and tailor their guest services and
identify individual preferences, and the introduction of an improved booking platform. For more information on the Digital
Roadmap, see “Business — Information Technology”.

**_Continue to invest in revenue-enhancing upgrades of Center Parcs accommodation offering and to expand available_**
**_capacity._**

Center Parcs plans to continue to invest in upgrading the accommodation and facilities in its villages, and to
introduce new accommodation and on-site activities. Since 2007, Center Parcs has opened 110 new units of accommodation
at its Original Villages, and significantly upgraded 2,778 units (accounting for approximately 84% of total units), with the
remaining 533 units expected to be upgraded in the near to medium term at an average estimated cost of approximately
£50,000 per lodge.

There is also capacity for additional new builds of premium lodges at Center Parcs’ villages, which typically
achieve a premium over the rate achieved on standard lodges. Center Parcs believes that such premium lodges attract affluent
guests who are more likely to be high on-site spenders. Center Parcs plans to build approximately 100 new premium lodges at
Woburn Village. Under its existing planning decision, Center Parcs has planning permission for more than two-thirds of these
premium lodges, which are expected to open in 2017 with the remaining premium lodges expected to follow thereafter; this is
referred to as Woburn Phase II. In addition, Center Parcs currently plans to build around 100 new premium lodges and onebedroom apartments, subject to planning permission and other factors, at the Original Villages. The new premium lodges are
expected to include treehouses, waterside lodges, spa suites and other executive lodges. Center Parcs currently has planning
permission for more than a quarter of these new builds.

**_Disciplined investment in village experience._**

Center Parcs believes that there are several substantial development projects that could profitably expand Center
Parcs’ offering, including Project Atlantis, which involves the strategic enhancement of the signature sub-tropical swimming
paradise that features at each village. Center Parcs spent over £10 million between 2012 and 2015 on implementing Project
Atlantis. Improvements included the addition of a new raft ride, the Tropical Cyclone, and a new play area featuring
numerous slides and water feature at Elveden, in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The introduction of the Tropical Cyclone at
Elveden delivered a meaningful ADR increase. Over the next five years, Center Parcs plans to make similar upgrades to the
pool facilities at Longleat, Sherwood and Whinfell villages.

Center Parcs also intends to introduce new, as well as innovate upon, leisure activities at each village on a regular
basis. Development opportunities include introducing electric boats and expanding indoor climbing activities to all villages.
Center Parcs believes that such investments provide an enriched holiday experience particularly for the affluent families that
form its core guest base, and that an improved on-site offering helps to drive both accommodation and on-site revenue.

**_Grow on-site spend._**

Center Parcs’ on-site revenue at the Original Villages grew at a CAGR of 3.4% from financial year 2013 to
financial year 2015. As Center Parcs’ guests typically remain on-site for the duration of their stay, Center Parcs believes that
there are opportunities to grow on-site spend further. For example, Center Parcs is currently developing a programme of
enhanced differentiation in pricing. Through the programme, prices of various offerings are expected to become flexible
across villages or seasons to more accurately reflect guest demand. In addition, Center Parcs expects to increase the range of

102


-----

products and services available to guests. Further, Center Parcs aims to continue enhancing ease of payment for its guests by
expanding cashless payment options, currently available at selected areas at Woburn Village and Whinfell Village, across all
its villages.

Center Parcs has franchise, licensing and concession agreements with various providers, such as Starbucks, Casual
Dining Group (formerly Tragus) (whose offering includes Café Rouge and Bella Italia) and SSP (whose offering includes
gastro pubs and fast food outlets). These concession partners enable guests to benefit from high street brand offerings and
Center Parcs to increase profitability through increased on-site spend. Center Parcs reviews these agreements periodically to
ensure that they remain economically attractive and meet its guests’ requirements. Center Parcs believes that there is also an
opportunity to increase revenue from its outside guests, especially through its Aqua Sana spa facilities, which Center Parcs
continues to upgrade and expand.

**_Continue to increase profitability through controlling costs._**

Center Parcs benefits from having a flexible cost base. Because of the high level of forward booking visibility of the
business, Center Parcs is able to manage its cost base effectively to meet its business requirements. As part of the strategy to
seek profitable growth, it intends to generate cost savings through increased efficiency at each village and at its head office.
Center Parcs also plans to continue to improve and streamline booking options. For example, it recently launched an app that
allows guests to book activities, check their itinerary and find their way around the villages.

**Business Description**

**_Product Offering_**

Center Parcs’ focus is on the short-break holiday market. Center Parcs’ guests can choose from three pre-defined
break durations: the weekend (Friday to Monday), mid-week (Monday to Friday) or a week (Friday to Friday or Monday to
Monday, comprised of a weekend break and mid-week break). Guests can also book combinations of these breaks.
Accommodation is charged on a per-break rather than per-sleeper or per-night basis (with the exception of the Spa Suites
which are sold on a per-night basis). 95% of holidays booked are for three or four night breaks.

Although located near urban centres, Center Parcs villages are each set within approximately 400 acres of forest
around a lake and offer year-round, all-weather holidays in a car-free natural environment.

Center Parcs generated 59.1%, 59.1% and 58.7% of its total revenue from accommodation in financial years 2013,
2014 and 2015, respectively. Center Parcs’ occupancy rates have averaged over 94% in the last 15 years, with approximately
42% of total lodge nights (defined as the aggregate number of lodges occupied by guests for a night) for the next 12 months
already booked at the start of financial year 2016 on 24 April 2015.

Each village offers approximately 150 leisure and spa related activities, along with on average 16 bars and
restaurants and 9 shops. Woburn Village also has an award-winning spa.

Center Parcs generated 40.9%, 40.9% and 41.3% of its total revenue from on-site spend in financial years 2013,
2014 and 2015, respectively.

**_Accommodation_**

Accommodation is a critical part of the overall guest experience at Center Parcs and the key financial driver,
representing 58.7% of total revenue, or £226.1 million, in financial year 2015 on an unaudited pro forma combined basis. As
at 23 April 2015, Center Parcs offered 3,421 units of accommodation across its Original Villages and from June 2014,
706 units at Woburn, totalling 4,127 units of accommodation across its five villages. Investment, maintenance and
refurbishment are on-going to keep all accommodation up to date, fresh and contemporary.

Accommodation at each village comprises a range of one to four bedroom lodges, and one and two bedroom
apartments, some of which include self-catering facilities. Each village offers a range of different grades of accommodation,
from entry level comfort units to exclusive lodges and treehouses with jacuzzis, steam rooms and an assortment of premium
facilities, as well as a small number of apartments and hotel rooms. Center Parcs plans to complete the upgrade of all of its
accommodation within the next two to three years. This involves the upgrade of the remaining 533 units across the Original
Villages to its new contemporary style accommodation at an average cost of approximately £50,000.

Between financial years 2007 and 2015, Center Parcs added 110 new lodges at the Original Villages. In addition,
Center Parcs currently plans to build around 100 new premium lodges and one-bedroom apartments, subject to planning
permission and other factors, at the Original Villages. The new premium lodges are expected to include treehouses, waterside
lodges, spa suites and other executive lodges. Center Parcs currently has planning permission for more than a quarter of these
new builds. At Woburn Village, Center Parcs plans to build approximately 100 new premium lodges, of which it already has
planning permission for more than two-thirds of the lodges to be built as part of Woburn Phase 2 under its existing planning
decision.

(1) Excluding Woburn Village, 84.4% of total units have been upgraded.

_Comfort/Comfort Plus Lodges (existing entry level standard)_

This is the existing base entry level accommodation which offers the essentials in a sociable open plan setting. At
the end of April 2015, this style represented 6% of total accommodation units. In order for the accommodation to meet guest
expectations, refurbishment programmes are planned to upgrade this level of accommodation to Woodland Lodge
specification in the near to medium term. Elveden and Longleat have already been fully re-modelled as at November 2014.

_Woodland Lodges (new entry level standard)_

The Woodland Lodges feature oak-style flooring with a well equipped kitchen (including a full range of integrated
appliances), a multi-channel TV and DVD player and well apportioned bathrooms and bedrooms. This level of
accommodation is available in two, three and four bedroom layouts. Woodland Lodges will become the entry level standard
of accommodation once the remaining Comfort and Comfort Plus Lodges have been upgraded.

_Executive Lodges_

This level of accommodation offers an overall higher level of functionality and furnishings. The majority of the
three to four bedroom Executive Lodges have saunas as well as the additional benefits of en suite bathrooms and daily
housekeeping service. Refurbishment programmes are upgrading this standard to the New Style Executive Lodges
specification with more modern interior design schemes, kitchens (including appliances) and bathroom suites. Center Parcs
expects that over the near to medium term, all original Executive Lodges will be upgraded to the New Style Executive Lodges
specification.

_Exclusive Lodges_

As the luxury version of the Executive Lodges, this accommodation is the top of the range, comprising two storey,
four bedroom, detached lodges designed for families or groups who desire the privacy of their own spa area and enclosed
garden. The Exclusive Lodges also include a steam room, sauna and outdoor hot tub.

_Spa Suites_

Center Parcs introduced Spa Suites in November 2011 with the opening of four units at Elveden. They are luxurious
one bedroom units adjacent to the Aqua Sana spa and provide direct access to the Spa facilities with entry included as part of
the tariff. Unlike all other accommodation types they are sold on a per night basis.

104


-----

_Treehouses_

The two storey luxury Treehouses are designed for families or friends who want the ultimate Center Parcs
experience with views of the forest and a balcony to every bedroom. Three Treehouses opened at Sherwood in December
2010, and a further three opened at Longleat in late 2011. The accommodation consists of four en suite bedrooms, an infrared
sauna room, a balcony hot tub, as well as a separate games den with pool table, and offers a daily housekeeping service and
free Wi-Fi access. Treehouses have achieved the highest ADR of all accommodation stock in financial year 2015, followed by
Exclusive Lodges.

_Apartments and Hotel Rooms_

Sherwood, Longleat and Whinfell have Executive standard apartment style accommodation with self-catering
facilities. Elveden has an 88 bedroom room hotel, the Lakeview, and Woburn has a 75 room hotel room.

**_Leisure Activities_**

Center Parcs offers more than 150 leisure and spa activities at each of its villages. These activities range from
passive and gentle to active and high adrenaline. Excluding the Aqua Sana spa, leisure activities comprised 12% of the total
revenue and 28% of total on-site revenue, or £45 million, in financial year 2015 on an unaudited pro forma combined basis.

_Sub-tropical Swimming Paradise_

The sub-tropical swimming paradise is the core leisure offer of each Center Parcs village and is free to guests. The
pools are heated all year and have slides, toddler water playgrounds and a variety of other features, such as family raft rides at
Elveden, Sherwood and Woburn. Across the five villages, the pool complex averages over 5,500 square metres in size, with
an average capacity of over 1,400 people in the pool and changing areas. Various activities are available, including scuba
diving and aqua jetting. Guests can also hire a cabana with seating, a television and complimentary soft drinks.

Center Parcs has commenced Project Atlantis, a strategic enhancement of its pool offer. The review covers facility
maintenance as well as opportunities to add new features. Project Atlantis is an investment capital expenditure program
pursuant to which over £10 million was spent between 2012 and 2015 at the Original Villages in order to enhance the offering
and guest experience. Center Parcs expects to spend a similar additional amount of capital expenditure on Project Atlantis in
the short term. In autumn 2012, a new raft ride at Elveden, the Tropical Cyclone, was introduced and in June 2013, a family
play area including numerous slides and water features opened at Elveden. These concepts were included within Woburn.
Cabanas, which guests can hire, have been introduced at all sites. Project Atlantis is expected to be completed by 2020.

_Outdoor Activities_

Outdoor activities offered by Center Parcs vary from adventure golf and nature walks to high adrenaline activities
such as high ropes, tree trekking and zip wires. All villages have a lake which offers a wide range of water sports and boats
for hire. In 2014, Sherwood started offering electric boats for hire and these are expected to be introduced to all other villages
during 2015. All villages also provide access to boathouses and beaches, where paddle boats and activities such as canoeing
and sailing are on offer. All the villages have an outdoor activity centre providing activities such as Segways[®], archery, quad
biking and laser combat. Sherwood and Whinfell also have nature centres which allow guests to learn about the village’s
wildlife as well as provide activities such as falconry, woodland walks and educational tours. Center Parcs also offers festivethemed activities from November through the Christmas period as villages are transformed into “Winter Wonderland”. Center
Parcs’ focus on capacity management has enabled extra sessions for guests, further increasing profitability. New outdoor
activities recently introduced include electric boats and mini tree trekking for younger children.

_Indoor Activities_

Indoor activities include traditional activities, such as badminton, ten pin bowling, snooker, pool and table tennis, all
of which are consistently popular with guests and accordingly, have generated consistent revenue streams. Access to a
gymnasium and arcade are also available across all villages. Classes are offered for activities such as fencing and climbing.
Pottery painting was introduced initially at Longleat in 2010 and has been rolled out to all villages. It caters to all age groups
and is a popular activity which has seen significant revenue growth.

Ten pin bowling is also a popular activity with guests. There are two bowling locations at Sherwood and Woburn
and one location at each other village.

New indoor activities recently introduced include a caving experience at Whinfell and Sherwood and an Indoor
Climbing Adventure at Longleat. These offers are planned to be introduced at other villages.

105


-----

_Children’s Activities_

Center Parcs offers a wide range of activities tailored for children aged from six months to 14 years. Many such
activities are offered through the “Activity Den”. Trained staff offer a spectrum of activities, from traditional crèche and soft
play areas for toddlers to hair braiding and activities such as Den Building for older children and teenagers. In addition to the
“Activity Den”, classes for younger guests are offered in sports including football and cricket. Roller skating and junior
archery are also popular.

_Cycle Hire_

The car-free environment makes cycling a key feature of the Center Parcs experience. Each village has a cycle fleet
of approximately 1,900 cycles on average. Center Parcs reviews its fleet regularly and invests significantly in new ranges of
cycles to replace older models. In line with the initiative to pre-book more activities, pre-booking of cycles represented more
than half of total cycle bookings at the Original Villages in financial year 2015, reducing queuing times and improving
planning.

_Aqua Sana — Spa and Treatments_

The Aqua Sana spa is open to outside guests as well as to village guests, with most bookings made in advance and
pre-paid prior to arrival. Aqua Sana comprised 5% of total revenue and 13% of total on-site revenue, or £21 million, in
financial year 2015 on an unaudited pro forma combined basis.

Each village has between 18 and 23 treatment rooms and extensive spa facilities with a variety of different
“experience rooms”, hydrotherapy pools, saunas and meditation areas. Treatments range from massage through to more
advanced facials and beauty treatments for both men and women.

Aqua Sana facilities have benefited from on-going refurbishment and upgrades, with approximately £1 million
invested at the Original Villages since the beginning of financial year 2014. Retail shops offer a wide variety of beauty
products from well-known brands, including Elemis and Decleor. The Aqua Sana offer at all villages includes a “Vitalé Café
Bar” TM food and beverage offer serving light meals and refreshments.

A new concept of Spa Suites was introduced at Elveden in 2011. They provide a package of an overnight stay
combined with access to the Aqua Sana. Four units were opened and unlike other accommodation can be booked on a nightly
basis. Woburn Village opened with six Spa Suite units and the concept is intended to be rolled out at other villages in the near
to medium term.

Revenue from outside guests has been an area of growth, reaching approximately one-third of Aqua Sana revenue in
financial year 2015. The business continues to work towards ensuring the right offer for both village guests and outside
guests.

Aqua Sana system improvements have enhanced the financial performance of Aqua Sana. Online booking is
available and a new web site was introduced in 2014. The Aqua Sana receives dedicated operational and sales and marketing
support. Center Parcs will continue to refurbish and upgrade facilities and invest in system enhancements.

_Conference Facilities_

Sherwood, Elveden, Longleat and Woburn offer purpose built conference and meeting facilities. Woburn provides
the largest conference facilities and can accommodate up to 400 delegates. Each of the villages offers an extensive range of
leisure activities, which can be used during conferences for teambuilding purposes, such as raft building, tree trekking or
aerial adventures. The use of these conference and meeting facilities are booked through Center Parcs’ Corporate Events
division.

**_On-site Food and Beverage_**

Center Parcs seeks to provide its guests with an extensive range of dining experiences, with on-site food and
beverage sales comprising 17% of total revenue and 42% of total on-site revenue, or £66 million, in financial year 2015 on an
unaudited pro forma combined basis.

Each village has an average of 16 restaurants and bars. This provides a choice of restaurants, some targeted at
families, with play areas and children’s menus while others offer premium dining. Center Parcs believes that these on-site
food and beverage facilities are popular with its guests and have enabled higher sustained pricing and limited promotional
activity compared with restaurants located on high streets. Menus are reviewed regularly and restaurants have been
refurbished and upgraded on a rolling cycle to ensure that standards and the experience are maintained to a high standard.

Concession partners operate certain outlets and account for approximately a third of on-site spend on food and
beverage. Approximately one-third of the outlets are operated under concession agreements with Casual Dining Group
(formerly Tragus) and SSP. Under these concession agreements, the concession fees payable by each of Casual Dining Group
(formerly Tragus) and SSP to Center Parcs is the greater of a set minimum fee or a specified percentage of their respective
revenue. Current revenue generated by each of Casual Dining Group (formerly Tragus) and SSP is above the minimum
guaranteed. Concession partners bring industry operational expertise to Center Parcs and have brought high street brand
names such as Café Rouge, Strada and Bella Italia to the villages.

The food and beverage offer includes the following:

      - Starbucks is operated as a franchise in all villages under licence. There are thirteen units in total including three
at Woburn.

      - Café Rouge (all villages), Bella Italia (Elveden, Whinfell), Strada (Sherwood, Longleat, Woburn) and Hawtons
(Longleat only) are managed under a concession agreement by Casual Dining Group (formerly Tragus) which
pays a concession fee.

      - A gastro pub concept restaurant operates in Sherwood, Elveden and Woburn. These units are operated under a
concession agreement by SSP, which pays a concession fee.

      - A takeaway or delivery service in all villages. Dining In offers guests the opportunity to choose among Indian,
Chinese and Italian cuisine.

      - An American style restaurant (Hucks) operates in all villages. These restaurants are family orientated and
include a children’s play area.

**_On-site Retail_**

Center Parcs offers a range of both food and non-food retail at each of its villages, which comprised 7% of total
revenue and 17% of total on-site revenue, or £27 million, in financial year 2015 on an unaudited pro forma combined basis.

The retail outlets have been designed to complement the activities at Center Parcs and the requirements of its guests.
Each village has an average of eight main retail outlets and a number of satellite retail offers.

The on-site supermarket, the ParcMarket, provides guests with a full range of products comparable to a high street
convenience store for guests’ self-catering requirements. The shop includes a range of fresh foods, fresh breads and pastries
baked on-site, and a wide range of wines, beers and spirits as well as a comprehensive grocery offer. Prices are monitored
against comparably sized outlets in the surrounding areas. Sales averaged approximately £4 million per year per ParcMarket
for financial year 2015.

Each village also has a confectionery shop, a gift shop with a wide variety of gifts and souvenirs and a toy store
catering for children of all ages. There is also a shop within the cycle centre.

Since 2008, the Nuance Group has been Center Parcs’ strategic retail partner and began operating the “Sportique”
and “Aquatique” shops under a concession agreement. Two new shops, “Time for Shade” and “Spirit”, were introduced and
are also managed and operated under this concession agreement. In late 2011, Nuance began operating the gift shop “Store
Room” and toy store “Just Kids” across all villages. The Nuance Group management of these units has allowed Center Parcs
to develop a partnership with an operator with a well-established retail network and to extend and improve the retail offer
including access to well-known brands including Superdry and Fat Face. The introduction of the concession partners enables
guests to benefit from high street brand offerings and Center Parcs to leverage industry expertise in order to increase
profitability. Approximately two-thirds of retail shops are operated under concession agreements with Nuance.

Bristol, Southampton, Swindon, Exeter and the M4 motorway corridor. Approximately 10.3 million total households and
4.5 million core households live within a 2.5 hour drive of Longleat.

_Tenure_

Parts of the property are held under two underleases from SPV 2 Limited (a subsidiary of CP Cayman Limited
Holdings L.P.), which in turn holds such parts of the property under two headleases from the Marquis of Bath. The term of the
first under lease is 72 years and 11 months from 23 March 2000 to 22 February 2073 for a current passing rent of
£611,747 per annum (pursuant to a 2009 rent review. A premium of £10 million was paid to the lessor. The term of the second
underlease is 72 years, five months and 29 days from 25 August 2000 to 22 February 2073 for a current passing rent of
£31,011 per annum (pursuant to a 2009 rent review). Both underleases had a first rent review in July 2004 and their second
rent review (due in July 2009) was settled in 2010. Rent reviews are carried out every five years. Rent reviews are upwards
only but limited by reference to revenue increase relative to whichever of the preceding review periods has the greatest
revenue. The remainder of the property (an outdoor activity centre) at Longleat is held under a lease between The Most
Honourable Alexander George Seventh Marquis of Bath and Longleat Property Limited. The term of this lease is 64 years,
one month and 25 days from 1 January 2009 to 25 February 2073 for a current passing rent of £12,000 per annum. This lease
is subject to a rent review mechanism on similar terms as the above-mentioned two underleases. The rent review discussions
in respect of Longleat 2014 rent review have been agreed in principle. Following the finalisation of this rent review, the rent
payable under the first underlease is expected to be revised to £731,621 per annum, the rent payable under the second
underlease is expected to be revised to £37,088 per annum and the rent payable under the lease for the outdoor activity centre
is expected to be revised to £16,000. The outcome of the rent review discussions is subject to the relevant rent memorandum
for each lease being signed. Center Parcs continues to pay rent at the level set at the previous rent review; the landlord is
accepting the existing rent pending the review and Center Parcs is accruing the amounts due following the rent review so that
they are fully accounted for.

**_Whinfell Forest_**

Whinfell was initially built by Rank and opened in 1997. It was subsequently sold to Bourne Leisure and then
acquired by Center Parcs in 2001. Whinfell comprises approximately 415 acres of land and is home to one of the UK’s last
remaining colonies of red squirrels, which can be seen regularly throughout the village. In the 2015 financial year, Whinfell
generated £75.7 million in revenue and £38.3 million Adjusted EBITDA.

_Location_

The property is located between Penrith and Temple Sowerby on the A66. Penrith is the closest town (population
approximately 15,000) and is approximately four miles west of the village.

_Transport Links_

The M6 motorway is approximately seven miles to the west of the village, providing motorway access to Scotland
and the northwest of England, as well as to the Midlands and the south of England. The closest rail facilities are located in
Penrith, which provides connections to major centres, including Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and London.

_Catchment Area_

Whinfell is the most northerly of the Center Parcs and it therefore tends to attract guests from Scotland, the north of
England and north Wales. The main catchment areas include Glasgow and the west coast of Scotland, Newcastle and the
north east, Liverpool, Manchester and the North West. However, due to the proximity of the village to the Lake District, this
facility also has a higher proportion of long distance guests. Approximately 7.1 million total households and 2.7 million core
households live within a 2.5 hour drive of Whinfell.

_Tenure_

The property is held under three separate titles — one being freehold and two being long leasehold. The leasehold
titles are held under two leases scheduled to expire in 2120 for a total passing rental of £1,000 per annum. A premium of
£3,288,500 (plus VAT) was previously paid in instalments for one lease, and a premium of £112,000 was paid in respect of
the other lease.

**_Woburn Village_**

The fifth village in Center Parcs’ portfolio has been constructed on 357 acres of mature forested land in Woburn,
Bedfordshire and opened to paying guests on 6 June 2014. Woburn has been built with the same core offer as the Original

110


-----

Villages but has introduced modern and contemporary accommodation designs and has a higher proportion of premium
accommodation offerings. It has 706 units of accommodation comprising 625 lodges, a 75 room hotel and 6 spa suites. There
are 349 units of executive accommodation, 49% of the total which is a higher percentage than any other village. This is
designed to service the anticipated demand of its affluent guest base in the south of England. Approximately 14 million total
households and 6.4 million core households live within an estimated 2.5 hour drive of Woburn (as compared to an average of
approximately 4.2 million core households for the Original Villages), the vast majority of whom have never been to Center
Parcs.

Woburn has planning permission for 75 premium lodges under its existing planning decision, in addition to the
625 lodges already built under the decision. Building for the 75 premium lodges is expected to commence in January 2016.
Furthermore, development opportunities to introduce other additional accommodation have been identified.

For the 44 weeks ended 23 April 2015, Woburn Village generated £65.6 million in revenue and £32.5 million
Adjusted EBITDA.

_Location_

Woburn is located approximately 60 miles north of London in Bedfordshire.

_Transport Links_

Woburn is six miles from the M1 motorway. The village also has convenient rail links, with a journey time of
45 minutes by train from London St. Pancras to Filtwick train station, located approximately two miles away.

_Catchment Area_

Woburn is the only Center Parcs village within a 90-minute drive time of London households. Woburn also has the
highest volume of core target households (3.2 million) within that drive time. For much of this population, the penetration for
Center Parcs has historically been low.

_Tenure_

The property is held in leasehold title under the terms of a lease with Woburn Estate Company Limited and Bedford
Estates Nominees Limited. The term of the lease is 99 years from 24 December 2010 for a current passing rent of £557,750
(pursuant to a 2013 rent review) per annum. A premium of £3,540,600 was paid to the lessor. The lease contains a rent review
clause with an upwards only review to take place every 5 years (with the next review due on 31 March 2018) by reference to
the greater of an increase in rent in line with the retail price index, a fixed percentage increase in the passing rent or the
historic increase in revenue at Woburn.

**Village Development**

The first step in the development of a new Center Parcs village is the identification of an appropriate site. There are
limited appropriate sites for villages as the Center Parcs’ model requires large forested areas near major population centres.
Following the identification of the site, planning permits for the development of the village need to be obtained. The
development of a new village has a long lead time due to the stringent requirements for these permits. In addition, a wide
range of specialised operations and planning expertise are required to develop a new village, including cost plans and budgets
as well as studies assessing the economic, geological and ecological impact of the new village. The planning phase is
followed by tender and procurement processes for the construction. These processes are then followed by the actual
construction and pre-opening training of village staff.

There are significant costs associated with the development of a village. For example, the development cost for
Woburn Phase 1 was approximately £250 million. Approximately 1,500 people were hired for the development process and
they collectively received approximately 84,000 hours of training. The actual building of the village involved the construction
of 706 units of accommodation in addition to the Village Square, the Indoor Plaza, the Subtropical Swimming Paradise and
other activity and leisure areas.

**Village Operations**

**_Operational Management_**

Each of Center Parcs’ villages are managed by a general manager and a deputy general manager, who oversee the
events manager, guest services manager and on-village revenue manager. Other individuals responsible for the management
of the village are the technical services manager, housekeeping manager, leisure services manager, village financial controller,
human resources manager, security manager, health and safety technician and food and beverage manager. As of 23 April

111


-----

2015, Center Parcs had an average of approximately 1,500 employees at each village. Center Parcs’ villages are akin to small
towns with their own infrastructure, including gas, water and power provision.

One of the key focus points of village operations is guest satisfaction. 96% of guests rated their break as “excellent”
or “good” in financial year 2015. Center Parcs uses the “Delivering Excellent Service” metric to measure service provision
across offerings. Guest feedback, particularly the monitoring of “Delivering Excellent Service” scores through guest surveys,
forms a central part of the internal review and improvement process for each village. Each operating unit at a village has
target “Delivering Excellent Service” scores as part of its bonus schemes.

**_Risk Management_**

Each village’s general manager is supported by an independent health and safety team at the head office. Each
village has regular risk meetings throughout the year. Center Parcs’ risk management policy focuses on health and safety
including guest safety, food safety, lodge safety, employee safety, fire safety and child protection. Center Parcs also centrally
monitors enterprise risk and key performance indicators.

**_Supply chain_**

Center Parcs primarily has a centralised purchasing function to ensure quality, competitiveness, regulatory and
ethical policy compliance, continuity and consistency across its five villages. Center Parcs mainly uses national suppliers that
service all five villages, ensuring economies of scale and commercial leverage, and therefore controlling overall costs. Center
Parcs’ villages also use local suppliers for certain goods and services to ensure provenance and speed of service as well as to
support corporate social responsibility initiatives. Altogether, Center Parcs manages approximately 1,900 suppliers centrally
and purchased approximately £120 million of goods and services in financial year 2015. Center Parcs has a dedicated
sourcing team focusing on utilities, food and beverage, fixtures, fittings and inventory, technical and ground services, laundry
services and leisure goods and services.

**Guest Profile**

Over 80% of the UK population lives within a 2.5 hour drive of at least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and the
majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two hour drive of the village they choose to visit.

In financial year 2015, 77% of Center Parcs’ guests were families, with families with pre-school children, families
with school age children and families with mixed age children comprising 30%, 28% and 19% of all guests, respectively.

During peak periods of school and national holidays, occupancy is driven by families with school age children.
During off-peak periods, families with pre-school children and infants support midweek occupancy while weekend guests are
predominantly families with school age children. During financial year 2015, during peak periods, Center Parcs’ guests
comprised 45% families with school age children, 16% families with pre-school children, 25% families with mixed age
children and 14% adult-only groups, while during off-peak periods, Center Parcs’ guests comprised 18% families with school
age children, 38% families with pre-school children, 15% families with mixed age children and 29% adult-only groups.

Center Parcs’ primary guest base are affluent families. According to management estimates, 84% of Center Parcs’
guests, as compared to 60% of the total population, are classified as “affluent achievers”, “rising prosperity” and “comfortable
communities” (42%, 10% and 32% of Center Parcs’ guests, respectively) based on ACORN postcode analysis. Center Parcs
also has a loyal guest base, with approximately 60% of guests returning within five years.

**Marketing**

Center Parcs is positioned as a relatively upmarket, high quality short-break holiday option for affluent families
wanting to spend time together, away from the stresses and routine of everyday life. Brand value and integrity underlines
Center Parcs’ marketing strategy.

Center Parcs engages directly with guests, with approximately 83% of bookings made online in 2015 and the
remaining through its in-house contact centre. Center Parcs does not deal with online affiliates or travel agents. As such, there
are no commission payments made to third parties selling Center Parcs to consumers.

Center Parcs’ accommodation pricing strategy is based on a demand driven model, where prices start at a low level
in order to generate demand and generally rise as sales increase along with demand as the holiday dates approach. This
approach rewards and encourages early booking (Center Parcs has an 18-month booking horizon) and has helped Center Parcs
increase revenues through economic cycles and has allowed it to maintain and improve occupancy rates. This is reflected in
“intention to return” scores of 95% in financial year 2015.

In 2009, Center Parcs introduced a dynamic demand-driven pricing model, overseen by its dedicated pricing team,
that enables management to optimise accommodation revenues by linking price to demand throughout the year. The pricing

112


-----

model utilises granular data, mapping holidays by length of break, accommodation type (with over 120 different types across
the villages for the purposes of the pricing model), time of year as well as by village and incorporates the previous year’s
average price as a base, adjusted for inflation and other factors (including the time of week, whether the period is peak or
off-peak and high occupancy versus quieter occupancy periods). This allows Center Parcs to smooth out its pricing across the
seasons, adapt its accommodation pricing to guest demand and facilitate its yield management. Prices are monitored in
real-time by the pricing team and benchmarked against other villages as well as the wider market, with daily prices reviews
(which take effect the subsequent day) to adapt the progression of bookings against the planned booking model.

Center Parcs’ on-site pricing is generally less variable than its accommodation pricing. All activities except for the
Subtropical Swimming Paradise are booked on a pay-per-use principle, and all activities are available for pre-booking. In
financial year 2015, approximately 60% of on-site activities are pre-booked and pre-paid. Center Parcs maintains clear price
lists for its activities to increase transparency.

Center Parcs maintains a guest database of approximately one million contacts, with approximately 460,000 of
those being considered active guests who had a Center Parcs break in the last 26 months or have an active booking.
Approximately 35% of guests return within 14 months, and approximately 60% return within five years. Given the cost
effectiveness of targeting guests who have previously stayed at a Center Parcs village, a significant proportion of the Center
Parcs marketing budget is focused on communicating with its existing guest base, targeting repeat visits and the sale of on-site
activities. The retention strategy focuses on an email programme that maintains communication with guests, from initial
enquiry for information, through booking of accommodation, pre-arrival booking of activities, to the post-visit “Welcome
Home” and “Anniversary” emails. Center Parcs also distributes the “Village Life” magazine to approximately
300,000 previous guests. In addition, Center Parcs constantly monitors on-going guest feedback through its online Guest
Service Questionnaire, which has been completed by over 30% of guests in recent periods, as well as through various
quantitative and qualitative research projects (including surveys and focus groups), website behavioural tracking and social
media reporting and monitoring to review the various elements of its business. Questionnaires have been exclusively online
since May 2010, which has significantly increased the number of returns and has improved guest feedback. Such research
helps guide marketing communications, but has also been the basis of improvements in both guest service and product
development (for example, accommodation refurbishment, pool upgrades, new leisure activities and introduction of the
Center Parcs app). Center Parcs also offers a “come back soon” price guarantee to guests when they leave thus incentivising
guests to return.

Center Parcs has recently launched the Digital Roadmap, an initiative to improve its pricing, booking and guest
database systems. For more information on the Digital Roadmap, see “— Information Technology”.

In addition to its retention strategy, Center Parcs integrates acquisition marketing activities through the purchase of
advertising space on websites, television programmes and newspapers aimed towards a more affluent market to bring in new
affluent guests that have potential to provide repeat business and good lifetime value through multiple return visits. Typically,
Center Parcs runs an integrated cross-channel media campaign, led by television and internet advertising, supplemented by
email, social media and other forms of public relations activities, all of which are seasonally, geographically and
demographically targeted for optimal effects. The largest spend of the year is focused upon the key booking period from late
December through to late February, when large numbers of UK consumers are in the market for holidays and short-breaks and
the propensity to book is higher.

In September 2009, Center Parcs introduced a new service programme called “Making Memorable Moments” to
enhance the level of service it provides to its guests. All staff have since been trained under the Making Memorable Moments
Programme. This effort has already yielded improved results, as measured by responses to guest questionnaires.

**Information Technology**

**_Digital Roadmap_**

In February 2015, Center Parcs launched Digital Roadmap, a multi-pronged process designed to further optimise
revenue by improving its digital capabilities, which is expected to be completed in the medium term with expected
investments primarily over the next two years. Through this process, Center Parcs plans to introduce more sophisticated
pricing tools in order to increase demand through targeted marketing and improved customer relationship management,
including by leveraging historic data and producing demand forecasts. The Digital Roadmap will be overseen by a steering
committee.

The Digital Roadmap aims to create automated price suggestions and intra-day price changes using revenue
optimisation tools for accommodation pricing, in order to facilitate real-time price monitoring and updates (including
intra-day price changes) and improve flexibility and reactivity.

Center Parcs also intends to introduce price variability between seasons and across villages for on-site pricing, to
respond to changes in demand, local economic conditions, and guest spending profiles such as through enhanced
identification of high on-site spenders with targeted offers.

113


-----

Through the Digital Roadmap, Center Parcs intends to maintain a more sophisticated customer database with a fully
integrated accommodation and on-site spend database, improved customer analytics, full social media and customer
relationship management integration and a robust online platform recognising individuals and profile segments. As a result,
Center Parcs intends to (i) facilitate access to guest data for guest-facing service departments and to provide more targeted
guest services, such as differentiating between first-time guests and repeat guests; (ii) boost individual guest identification
indicating individual preferences to enable Center Parcs to better tailor guest services; and (iii) allow for an improved user
booking experience by providing seamless, consistent and more responsive process across its booking systems.

**_Bookings Systems_**

Center Parcs’ pre-arrivals booking systems comprise a telephone-based in-house contact centre and an online
service via its website. Center Parcs has significantly improved cost efficiency and efficiency of call handling through the
consolidation of its call centre operations to its head office in 2010. Guests are able to book leisure activities six months in
advance through these booking systems. In addition to benefiting guests, these pre-arrivals booking systems help optimise
yield management and give Center Parcs greater planning time to ensure it meets demand through extra sessions and
employee capacity. A dedicated revenue management team ensures that accommodation demand and capacity are constantly
monitored to ensure revenue optimisation. In financial year 2015, approximately 60% of activities were pre-booked and
pre-paid prior to arrival. 100% of bookings are made directly with Center Parcs, with approximately 83% of accommodation
bookings made online in financial year 2015. Guests can book either online (using Center Parcs’ website, mobile site or app)
or on-site using new purpose built on-site booking points.

**_Mobile App_**

Center Parcs recently launched an app for smart phone users. The app allows guests to pre-book their
accommodation, in addition to pre-booking activities, checking their itinerary and navigating their way around the village.
The app also includes features to create personalised digital postcards and to actively connect the Center Parcs’ short break
experience with social media platforms. Center Parcs plans to enhance the mobile app, with direct targeted offers to current
and prior guests as well as potential guests for on-site activities.

market its holidays in the CP Opco territory pursuant to distribution agreements with travel agents in the United Kingdom
provided that the content of any publicity referring to Center Parcs Europe NV’s holidays has been previously agreed by CP
Opco. CP Opco must include in its brochures a page promoting Center Parcs Europe NV’s holiday villages, the content of
which is agreed with CP Opco. The page includes clear language that the two entities are owned separately. Under the
marketing arrangements, CP Opco is required to take telephone inquiries and bookings for Center Parcs Europe NV from
customers calling the number in its brochure. For this service, it is entitled to receive a variable commission based on the
annual accommodation revenue of the bookings made.

Center Parcs believes that its trademarks are valuable to the operation of its villages and are an integral part of its
marketing strategy, and is not aware of any existing infringing uses that could reasonably be expected to materially affect its
business.

Center Parcs is a large local employer in the locations where it operates and its strong brand awareness helps it
attract new employees. Center Parcs uses a centralised online recruitment system, in addition to references from current
employees. All new employees go through an induction programme that introduces them to Center Parcs’ customer service
initiatives. Employees also have access to on-the-job training including a management training course for employees looking
to transition into management roles. Center Parcs also offers apprenticeships, diploma courses and over 200 technical and
professional courses each year to its employees.

**Maintenance and Inspection**

Center Parcs uses both planned preventative maintenance and reactive maintenance regimes to ensure that its
accommodation, facilities, amenities, plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings are inspected and maintained to a standard
acceptable to its target guest base.

The planned preventative maintenance regime helps to ensure that Center Parcs has visibility of the total cost of
maintaining its assets and the cost of replacing end of life assets. The reactive maintenance regime ensures that Center Parcs
has a technical services team on call to attend to any maintenance issue 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The technical
services teams are complimented by external experts, technicians and engineers as required.

The Regional Directors of Operations and the senior management team of each village meet every six weeks to
inspect each village to ensure that all maintenance issues are identified and addressed. The villages have a fire, health and
safety inspection every two months. Furthermore, the Operations and Development Director conducts a two-day inspection at
each village twice a year.

**Insurance**

Center Parcs maintains insurance of the types it believes to be commercially reasonable and available to businesses
in its industry, and in amounts exceeding the statutory minimums. It maintains insurance policies that provide coverage for
property related risks, business interruption following loss of or damage to property, employers’ liability and public and
product liability.

Center Parcs’ current insurance policies expire on 30 June of each year. While insurance premiums have remained
relatively stable over recent years and no material changes are expected in the near term, Center Parcs cannot predict the level
of the premiums it may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage or the level of insurance available.

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, Center Parcs has been and is involved in disputes and litigation related to its business and
operations. In particular, the nature of the leisure activities which it provides and the industry in which it operates tend to
expose Center Parcs to claims by guests for personal injuries. Center Parcs investigates such claims thoroughly and,
depending on the circumstances, will settle or defend the claim accordingly. To date, none of these claims have been material.

Center Parcs is not currently party to any actual or threatened legal proceedings or disputes which may have a
material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.

**Regulation and Environment**

The villages operated by Center Parcs are subject to a number of national and local laws relating to the operation of
holiday breaks, including those regarding the sale of alcohol and offering of entertainment. Operating in forested areas with
endangered wildlife, the villages are also required to adhere to strict environmental codes.

Center Parcs’ operations are subject to increasingly stringent national and local environmental laws and regulations,
including laws and regulations governing air and noise emissions; wastewater and stormwater discharges and uses; oil
spillages; the maintenance of storage tanks and the use, release, storage, disposal, handling and transportation of, and
exposure to, chemicals and hazardous substances; and otherwise relating to health, safety and the protection of the
environment and natural resources and the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater.

Center Parcs is subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to its relationship with its employees, including
minimum wage requirements, child labour laws, health benefits, and overtime and working condition requirements. In
addition, Center Parcs is subject to the Equality Act 2010.

(“GPP”), a personal pension plan open to all employees and in which employees are automatically enrolled; and (b) the
Center Parcs Senior Pension Scheme (“FS Scheme”), an occupational final salary (defined benefit) arrangement with ten
members, of which two senior employees are active members. As at 30 September 2014, the GPP had approximately 3,275
members representing approximately 45% of all employees. As at 31 July 2014, the FS Scheme assets amounted to 85% of its
liabilities with a deficit of approximately £2.1 million on an on-going basis. As at 31 July 2014, the cost of buying out the

liabilities and the contributions in to the FS Scheme are not material in the context of Center Parcs’ revenue and assets.

**Corporate Governance**

Center Parcs manages risks through the Risk Committee, which is made up of the executive management committee
and other selected senior managers and meets quarterly to evaluate risks that have occurred, new and emerging risks, and the
effectiveness of mitigating controls. On a day-to-day basis, Center Parcs’ Fire, Health and Safety Steering Committee
oversees the safety and well-being of the guests and meets every ten weeks, chaired by the Operations and Development
Director. Matters not resolved by the Fire, Health and Safety Steering Committee are escalated to the Risk Committee.

Center Parcs has a team of internal auditors based across all five villages that operates independently from village
operations. The audit team looks at trends across the business to ensure that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
the preparation of financial statements. Before the commencement of each financial year, the directors and senior
management are consulted to prepare an audit plan for the year, highlighting areas that raise concern. Audits are then
performed at each village by the team of internal auditors and the resulting report is circulated to the directors.
Recommendations arising from the reports are discussed with the relevant management personnel to ensure that controls are
improved in a manner that results in efficient and secure procedures.

**Management Employment Contracts**

All members of the Operating Board have permanent employment contracts of indefinite terms, terminable on 12
months’ notice by the employer and 6 months’ notice by the relevant employee. The contracts include a standard commitment
not to compete during their employment as well as a 6-month non-compete post-contractual restrictive covenant. There are
further 12-month non-solicit post-contractual restrictive covenants in relation to employees and suppliers.

**Management of Center Parcs Following the Acquisition**

Following the Third Closing Date, the ultimate authority within the Center Parcs Group will rest with the Sponsor.
The Sponsor is expected to appoint directors to the Board of Directors of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and to the boards
of the principal Obligors. The size and composition of the boards of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and the principal
Obligors may change, from time to time, for various reasons.

The Operating Board will continue to be responsible for the daily operations of the Center Parcs Group. However,
there is no assurance that Center Parcs will be able to retain its current managing directors. See “Risk Factors — Center
_Parcs’ business could be harmed if it loses the services of its key management personnel or is unable to attract and retain_
_qualified employees.”_

Closing Date and issued the Class A3 Notes and the Class A4 Notes (together, the “Second Class A Notes”) on the Second
Issue Date. On the Second Closing Date, part of the proceeds of the issue of the Second Class A Notes were used to redeem
the Class A1 Notes in full. The Class A2 Notes and the Second Class A Notes are referred to as the “Class A Notes”.

On the Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Class A2 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make an advance
to the Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Original Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in an aggregate principal
amount of £440.0 million (the “Class A2 Loan”). On the Second Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Second

(x) £350.0 million in the case of the Class A3 Loan (the “Class A3 Loan”) and (y) £140.0 million in the case of the Class A4

The economic terms and conditions of the Class A2 Loan, the Class A3 Loan and the Class A4 Loan (together, the
“Class A Loans”) (including, among other things, in relation to the payment of interest and the repayment and prepayment of
principal) are broadly similar to the economic terms and conditions of the Class A2 Notes, the Class A3 Notes and the Class
A4 Notes, respectively.

The obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Class A Notes will rank equally in respect of security and as to
payment of interest and repayment and prepayment of principal but in priority to the obligations of the Issuer in respect of the
Class B Notes in point of security and as to payment of interest and repayment and prepayment of principal.

The Class A2 Notes bear interest at the rate of 7.239% per annum from (and including) the Closing Date up to (but
excluding) 28 February 2024 and 7.919% from (and including) 28 February 2024 up to (but excluding) 28 February 2042.

25 February 2042 to the extent not repaid, prepaid or otherwise discharged in full prior to that date.

In certain circumstances the Borrowers will be required to prepay the Class A Loans in full, including if it has
become unlawful for the Issuer or the Borrower to perform any of their respective obligations under the relevant documents or
if a Borrower is, or will be, required to pay to the Issuer a tax payment as a result of a change in law or in any published
practice or concession of any relevant tax authority.

In addition, the Borrowers may, by giving the relevant notice to the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee,

the Class A Restricted Payment Condition (as defined below) was satisfied as at the most recent date which is seven Business
Days before each loan interest payment date (the “Financial Covenant Test Date”).

In addition, the Borrowers must not make any payment in respect of the Class B Loan or purchase any Class B
Notes if the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is not then satisfied (other than if such payment is made using new equity
funds of any Borrower received for this purpose).

For these purposes:

The “Class A Restricted Payment Condition” is the condition which will be satisfied if:

(i) as at the most recent Financial Covenant Test Date, the Class A FCF DSCR calculated as at such
Financial Covenant Test Date is greater than or equal to 135%;

123

lesser of (i) £80 million; and (ii) 24 months’ peak debt service on the Class A Notes.

**_Financial Covenants_**

In addition to the general covenants described below, the Class A IBLA contains a financial covenant that requires
the Borrower to maintain a ratio (expressed as a percentage) of free cash flow to class A total debt service charges (the
“Class A FCF DSCR”) equal to or greater than 110% on each Financial Covenant Test Date. The Borrowers will have the

Upon the occurrence of an event of default and subject to the relevant grace periods, the Borrower Security Trustee
would be entitled to accelerate the debt or take an enforcement action in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Accession of Additional Site Entities_**

Subject to certain conditions, if an additional site in the United Kingdom is owned by a non-Obligor, such additional
site must accede to the Obligor Group within three years of the later of the acquisition of the relevant additional site or the
date the additional site has become operational and has started to receive paying customers (subject to certain exceptions).
The conditions to an additional site acceding to the Obligor Group include (a) confirmation from the Rating Agencies that
there would be no adverse effect on the then current rating of the Class A Notes and no adverse effect is reasonably expected
to occur; (b) such entity has not incurred financial indebtedness (subject to certain exceptions); and (c) a first ranking lien has
been granted over all of the assets of such entity.

**Liquidity Facility Agreement**

On the Second Issue Date, the Issuer entered into the Liquidity Facility Agreement with, among others, the
Liquidity Facility Providers, the Liquidity Facility Agent, the Cash Manager and the Issuer Security Trustee, pursuant to
which the Liquidity Facility Providers agreed to make a liquidity facility (the “Liquidity Facility”) available to meet certain
liquidity shortfalls.

Under the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Liquidity Facility Providers provides a 364-day
commitment in an aggregate amount equal to £80 million to permit drawings to be made by the Issuer to enable the Issuer to
service interest due on the Class A Notes, together with certain senior ranking expenses owed to other transaction parties, in
the event of there being insufficient cash flow received from the Obligors under the Class A IBLA.

The Liquidity Facility Agreement provides that the amounts drawn by the Issuer (such amounts, a “Liquidity Loan
**Drawing”) and repaid to the Liquidity Facility Providers may be redrawn.**

Each Liquidity Facility Provider must be a bank, the long term unsecured, unsubordinated and unguaranteed long
term obligations of which must be rated, in the case of S&P BBB and, in the case of Fitch, BBB (or, in each case, such other
lower rating which is consistent with the published criteria (relevant for the applicable counterparty) of the relevant Rating
Agency) (the “Requisite Rating”).

126


-----

The Liquidity Facility Agreement provides that: if (i) at any time the relevant rating of a Liquidity Facility Provider
falls below the Requisite Rating; or (ii) a Liquidity Facility Provider does not agree to renew such Liquidity Facility prior to
the expiry of the 364 day period, the Issuer shall, if it is unable to enter into a substitute liquidity facility in accordance with
the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement, draw the available commitment of such Liquidity Facility Provider and place
the same on deposit (such drawing, a “Standby Drawing”) in the relevant Liquidity Standby Account. The Issuer may only
withdraw amounts from such Liquidity Standby Account to enable the Issuer to service interest due on the Class A Notes,
together with certain senior ranking expenses owed to other transaction parties, in the event of there being insufficient cash
flow received from the Obligors under the Class A IBLA.

In addition, in the event that a Standby Drawing was made following the downgrade of a Liquidity Facility
Provider, the Issuer will use its reasonable endeavours to help such Liquidity Facility Provider to find a suitable replacement
Liquidity Facility Provider or guarantor (as applicable) with the Requisite Rating.

Interest accrues on any drawing made under the Liquidity Facility (including any Standby Drawing) at a rate equal
to LIBOR plus a margin (equal to 1.50% per annum). Under the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Issuer is also
required to pay additional amounts if: (i) a withholding or deduction for or on account of tax is imposed on payments required
to be made to any Liquidity Facility Provider; or (ii) any Liquidity Facility Provider suffers an increase in the cost of
providing its Commitment under the Liquidity Facility. From the Year 5 Step-Up Date the rate of interest applicable to any
Drawing made in respect of the Liquidity Facility Agreement will increase, every six months, on a cumulative basis by the
Year 5 Step-Up Margin up to a maximum of 5% per annum.

For these purposes:

“Year 5 Step-Up Date” means the Note Interest Payment Date next following the fifth anniversary of the date of
the Liquidity Facility Agreement.

“Year 5 Step-Up Margin” means 0.50% per annum, increasing by 0.50% on each Note Interest Payment Date
following the Year 5 Step-Up Date up to a maximum of 5.00% per annum.

Payments due under the Liquidity Facility will rank senior to interest and principal payments on the Class A Notes,
and after certain third party costs and expenses other than in relation to Liquidity Subordinated Amounts. The Liquidity
Facility Providers will not be permitted to enforce the security granted by the Obligors under the Issuer/ Borrower Loan
Agreements.

For these purposes:

“Liquidity Subordinated Amounts” means all amounts payable under, or in any way in connection with, the
Liquidity Facility Agreement, other than:

(a) principal and interest in respect of any Drawing made under the Liquidity Facility Agreement, except that:

(i) part of the interest (for the relevant interest period) on such Drawing which represents a
mandatory cost in excess of 0.20% per annum on the maximum amount drawn under the
Liquidity Facility Agreement from time to time; and

(ii) in respect of a Drawing made on or after the Year 5 Step-Up Date, the Year 5 Step-Up Margin;

(b) the commitment fee payable under the Liquidity Facility Agreement;

(c) any costs payable by the Issuer to an LF Finance Party under the Liquidity Facility Agreement as a result
of any increased costs of such LF Finance Party, including those arising from:

(i) the introduction of, or any change in, or any change in the interpretation, administration or
application of, any law or regulation; or

(ii) compliance with any law or regulation made after the date of the Liquidity Facility Agreement.

In the event that the Issuer is unable to make any payment of amounts due pursuant to the Liquidity Facility
Agreement, such amounts will accrue default interest at a rate of 1% per annum higher than the rate which would have been
otherwise payable, up to but excluding the date of actual payment.

**Original Class B Notes**

The Issuer issued the Original Class B Notes on the Closing Date.

On the Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Original Class B Notes were applied by the Issuer to make
advances to the Borrowers pursuant to the terms of the Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in an aggregate

127


-----

principal amount of £280.0 million. Pursuant to the Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer provided to
the Borrowers the Original Class B Loan which is contractually subordinated in terms of payments and security to the Class A
Loans (other than the Topco Share Security).

The Original Class B Notes accrue interest at the rate of 11.625% per annum from (and including) the Closing Date
up to (but excluding) 28 February 2020 and, thereafter, 6.25% per annum.

The expected maturity date for the Original Class B Loan is 23 February 2018. If, on such date, the Original Class B
Loan remains outstanding, the Original Class B Noteholders can enforce their rights under the Topco Share Security
Agreement and the CP Cayman Security Agreement, each as described in more detail below.

From (and including) 28 February 2018, the Issuer will not make payments of interest in respect of the Original
Class B Notes. Instead, interest will accrue on the Original Class B Notes at the applicable rate (as set out above) but will be
deferred and will be payable only on the earlier of (a) the date on which the Class A Notes are repaid in full and
(b) 28 February 2042. Interest will accrue on such deferred interest at the rate otherwise payable on unpaid principal of the
Original Class B Notes at such time.

The economic terms and conditions of the Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (including, among
other things, in relation to the payment of interest and the repayment and prepayment of principal) are broadly similar to the
terms and conditions of the Original Class B Notes.

On or after 28 February 2015, the Borrowers may prepay all or a part of the Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement at a specified prepayment price (expressed as a percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, on the Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement prepaid, to the applicable date of
prepayment. Upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax law, the Borrowers may prepay all of the Original Class B Issuer/
Borrower Loan Agreement at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Under the Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Borrowers will be required to maintain a ratio
(expressed as a percentage) of free cash flow to total debt service charges (the “Original Class B FCF DSCR”) equal to
100% on each Financial Covenant Test Date. The Borrowers will have the benefit of certain cure rights in the event that the
Class B FCF DSCR is less than 100%.

The Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement limits, among other things, Topco and the Obligors with
respect to:

(a) the incurrence or guarantee of additional indebtedness;

(b) the payment of dividends or other distributions on, and the redemption or repurchase of, its equity;

(c) the making of certain restricted payments and investments;

(d) the incurrence of certain liens;

(e) the imposition of restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends and other payments to
members of the Group;

(f) the transfer, lease, sale or other disposition of certain assets;

(g) the merger, consolidation with, or sale of substantially all of the Group members’ assets to, other entities;

(h) the entry into certain transactions with affiliates;

(i) the entry into sale and leaseback transactions; and

(j) the impairment of the security interest for the holders of the Original Class B Notes.

Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.

Subject to certain conditions, if an additional site is owned by a non-Obligor, such additional site must accede to the
Obligor Group within three years of the later of the acquisition of the relevant additional site or the date the additional site has
become operational and has started to receive paying customers (subject to certain exceptions). The conditions to an
additional site acceding to the Obligor Group include (a) confirmation from the Rating Agencies that there would be no
adverse effect on the then current rating of the Original Class B Notes and no such adverse effect is reasonably expected to
occur; (b) such entity has not incurred financial indebtedness (subject to certain exceptions); and (c) a first ranking lien has
been granted over all of the assets of such entity.

128


-----

A portion of the Original Class B Notes is expected to remain outstanding as of the Third Closing Date. On 20 July
2015, Bidco launched a tender offer to purchase or procure the purchase of the Original Class B Notes in full, together with
accrued interest up to the date of purchase. All of the Original Class B Notes properly tendered prior to the expiration of the
tender offer will be purchased on the Third Closing Date by the Borrowers. The remaining outstanding amount of Original
Class B Notes are expected to be redeemed thereafter.

No event of default may occur with respect to the Class B Notes or Class B Loans while the Class A Loans or
Class A Notes are still outstanding (until after an acceleration of the Class A Notes or Class A Loans, respectively). However,
upon the occurrence of any event that would otherwise constitute an event of default (each being a Share Enforcement Event),
the Class B Noteholders have the ability to demand repayment by Topco pursuant to the Topco Payment Undertaking and
direct the security trustee to enforce the security granted pursuant to the Topco Security Documents. The events that could
lead to such a Share Enforcement Event or, in certain cases, an event of default, are customary for high yield debt instruments
and subject to customary grace periods.

If at any time no Class A Loans or Additional Class A Loans remain outstanding, or an acceleration of the Class A
Loan has occurred, any such Share Enforcement Event will also constitute a Class B Loan Event of Default.

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Class B Notes and any non-contractual obligations arising out of
or in connection with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Class B Notes are governed by English law.

Undertaking or any other Topco Transaction Document (including, as a result of the enforcement of the Topco

**26.12** **Indemnity required — Obligor level**

The Borrower Security Trustee will not be obliged to deliver a Loan Enforcement Notice, a Loan Acceleration

indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction against all Liabilities to which it may become liable or which it may
incur by giving any Loan Enforcement Notice, Loan Acceleration Notice or taking any Enforcement Action in
respect of the Borrower Security except that the Borrower Security Trustee agrees that, in respect of the
appointment of a Receiver pursuant to paragraph 26.5 (Appointment of Receiver to block an administrator —
Obligor level) only, notwithstanding any other term of the ICA or any other Borrower Transaction Document, it is
adequately indemnified and secured to its satisfaction.

**27.** **ENFORCEMENT ACTION IF CLASS B NOTES OUTSTANDING**

**27.1** **Introduction**

The ICA will provide that the exercise and enforcement of rights by the Instructing Group in respect of the
Borrower Security that has become enforceable is in certain circumstances subject to the provision of a Fairness
Opinion to the Class B Note Trustee (for the benefit of itself and the Class B Noteholders).

**27.2** **Requirement for a Fairness Opinion**

If:

(a) there are any Class B Notes outstanding;

(b) the Borrower Security has become enforceable; and

(c) the Class A Instructing Group have instructed the Issuer Security Trustee to require the Borrower Security
Trustee to deliver a Class A Loan Enforcement Notice,

then, subject to paragraph 27.3 (Borrower Security Trustee may dispose under a Sales Process), the Borrower
Security Trustee will (or will procure that any agent, receiver or delegate appointed to act on behalf of the Borrower
Security Trustee pursuant to this Agreement will) comply with the following conditions:

(i) before any disposal of any Borrower Secured Property of a value more than £10 million the Borrower
Security Trustee will procure the provision to the Class B Note Trustee (for the benefit of itself and the
Class B Noteholders), of a Fairness Opinion (having asked at least three potential Financial Advisers for a
quote in respect of the costs for the provision thereof);

(ii) such Fairness Opinion must be delivered to the Class B Note Trustee at least two weeks before the
proposed disposal;

(iii) subject to and in accordance with paragraph 27.3 (Borrower Security Trustee may dispose under a Sales
Process), the Borrower Security Trustee will be responsible for commissioning any Fairness Opinion;

(iv) neither the Class B Note Trustee nor any Class B Noteholder will be entitled to raise any objections to any
Fairness Opinion delivered by the Borrower Security Trustee in accordance with paragraph (ii); and

(v) the cost of commissioning any Fairness Opinion will be for the account of the Borrower Security Trustee
provided always that the Borrower Security Trustee is prefunded to an amount equal to the cost of such
Fairness Opinion as an expense of the enforcement process except that if the cost is more than £500,000
(excluding VAT), then:

(A) the excess cost will be for the account of the Class B Noteholders, provided that:

I. where one of the potential Financial Advisers offered to produce a Fairness Opinion
for less than £500,000 (excluding VAT) but the Class A Noteholders directed the
Borrower Security Trustee to select another provider whose fees for providing the
opinion are in excess of £500,000, all such fees will be for the account of the
enforcement process generally (and not specifically for the account of the Class B
Noteholders); and

II. if more than one potential Financial Adviser provides a quote and all the quotes
provided are in excess of £500,000, the Class B Noteholders will be required to pay

185


-----

for all fees in excess of £500,000 save where the Class A Noteholders select a
Financial Adviser which has provided a quote which is higher than another quote
provided; and

(B) the Borrower Security Trustee will not be obliged to commission any Fairness Opinion unless:

I. it is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction and/or prefunded; and/or

II. receives an undertaking from the Class B Noteholders that the Class B Noteholders
will indemnify, secure and/or pre-fund the Borrower Security Trustee for any excess
costs in relation to commissioning any Fairness Opinion, if applicable.

**27.3** **Borrower Security Trustee may dispose under a Sales Process**

If the Borrower Security Trustee:

(a) is unable to appoint a Financial Adviser when requested or unable to obtain a Fairness Opinion; or

(b) is notified in writing by the Class B Note Trustee on behalf of the Class B Noteholders that the Class B
Noteholders do not require the procurement of a Fairness Opinion; or

(c) intends to dispose of the assets for a value that is less than the proposed consideration specified in respect
of such assets in a Fairness Opinion, then:

(i) subject to applicable law, the Borrower Security Trustee or any Receiver will only dispose of
relevant assets through a competitive marketing and sales process typical for such type of assets
with a view to obtaining a fair market consideration for such assets under the then prevailing
market conditions (“Sales Process”) and will be entitled to appoint any investment bank,
accounting firm or any other third party professional organisation of international standing
engaged in the marketing and sale of businesses and assets, to advise the Borrower Security
Trustee or the Receiver in relation to such disposal; and

(ii) the Borrower Security Trustee or any Receiver will be entitled to dispose of the assets under and
in accordance with the Sales Process (including, at a value less than that stated in any Fairness
Opinion), provided that if there is more than one party willing to acquire the assets, then the
Borrower Security Trustee or the Receiver will be required to accept the highest executable
offer.

**27.4** **Fairness Opinion only required if Class A Notes are outstanding**

Except as set out in paragraph 27.2 (Requirement for a Fairness Opinion), in no other circumstances will a Fairness
Opinion be required prior to the disposal of any Borrower Secured Property.

**27.5** **Class A Instructing Group may provide Directions to appoint Financial Adviser**

The Class A Instructing Group may provide any Direction to Issuer Security Trustee to require the Borrower
Security Trustee to appoint any Financial Adviser and the Borrower Security Trustee will act in accordance with
any such Direction.

**27.6** **Borrower Security Trustee entitled to seek Directions from the Class A Instructing Group**

(a) Further to paragraph 27.5 (Class A Instructing Group may provide Directions to appoint Financial Adviser), the
Borrower Security Trustee will be entitled to seek any Direction from the Issuer Security Trustee in relation to any
matter concerning the commissioning of a Fairness Opinion or otherwise, the enforcement of the Borrower Security
and the Borrower Security Trustee will be required to follow any Direction given by the Issuer Security Trustee.

(b) The Issuer Security Trustee will be entitled to seek any Direction from the Class A Instructing Group in relation to
any request for any Direction made by the Borrower Security Trustee pursuant to paragraph (a) above, concerning
the commissioning of a Fairness Opinion or otherwise the enforcement of the Borrower Security and the Issuer
Security Trustee will be required to follow any Direction given to it by the Class A Instructing Group.

The ICA will provide that notwithstanding that neither Security Trustee nor any other Secured Creditors may have
any right of recourse against the Rating Agencies in respect of any Rating Agency Confirmation or any Rating
Assessment given by any of them and relied upon by such Security Trustee, each Security Trustee will be entitled,
for the purposes of exercising any right, power, trust, authority, duty or discretion under or in relation to the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party or over which it has security:

(a) to have regard to any Rating Agency Confirmation or any Ratings Assessment if the Transaction
Documents require, or in any particular circumstance, where such Security Trustee considers, that a
Rating Agency Confirmation or a Ratings Assessment is an appropriate test or the only appropriate test to
apply in that circumstance, in exercising any such power, trust, authority, duty or discretion or, as the case
may be, in giving the relevant consent; and

Security Trustee will be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that:

(a) a Ratings Assessment is a point-in-time assessment which does not constitute a credit rating by Fitch; will
not be monitored by Fitch and therefore will not be updated to reflect changed circumstances or
information that may affect the Ratings Assessment; and does not address other matters falling outside of
the Relevant Disposal (as defined in the Class A IBLA) that may be of relevance to the Noteholders;

(b) neither of the Security Trustees will have any right of recourse to or against Fitch in respect of a Ratings
Assessment which is relied upon by either Security Trustee; and

back transaction.

“Representative” means:

(a) any representative appointed by the Borrower Security Trustee; and/or

(b) any person acting on the direction of the Borrower Security Trustee, including, in each case, and without

(a) Any one or more of the Class B Noteholders will be entitled, pursuant to the Class B Call Option, to purchase all
(but not some only) of the Class A Notes within the Class B Call Option Period and that at a price equal to the Class
B Call Option Purchase Price, subject to the terms set out below.

(b) If the Borrower Security Trustee (or its Representative) intends to enter into and/or give its consent to a Relevant
Disposal then the Borrower Security Trustee (or its Representative, as the case may be) must promptly provide
written notice of such intention to the Issuer, the Class A Note Trustee, the Class B Note Trustee and the Principal
Paying Agent for each class of Notes (a “Disposal Intention Notice”). Neither the Borrower Security Trustee nor

Period.

(c) Within one Business Day of (i) the receipt of a Disposal Intention Notice and/or (ii) the occurrence of a Class B Call
Option Trigger Event as set out in paragraph (b) of the definition of that term, above, the Issuer must publish (or
cause the Principal Paying Agent in respect of the Class B Notes to publish) a notice (a “Class B Call Option
**Notice”) to the Class B Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders) and on a**
Regulatory Information Service (as defined in the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) (with a copy to the
Class A Note Trustee and the Class B Note Trustee) detailing (I) the occurrence of the relevant Class B Call Option
Trigger Event, (II) the right of the Class B Noteholders to exercise the Class B Call Option in accordance with the
terms of the Class A Conditions, the Class B Conditions and the Intercreditor Agreement and (III) contact
information for the Issuer and information as to the procedures for how the Class B Noteholders can, if they wish to
exercise the Class B Call Option, do so (including, without limitation, procedures which must be complied with for

each Principal Paying Agent whether or not any Class B Noteholder has exercised its right to purchase the Class B
Notes. If any such Class B Noteholder or Class B Noteholders has or have elected to purchase the Class A Notes
then such notice must specify (I) the date of settlement (which must be not earlier that five Business Days and not

of, the Class A Noteholders.

(f) Payment must be made to Class A Noteholders in freely transferable funds to their account maintained with the

Class B Noteholders will be a condition precedent to the obligation of any Class A Noteholders to transfer, or
consent to the transfer, of the Class A Notes held by them. For the avoidance of doubt, payment by the Class B
Noteholders to the Class A Noteholders will not be made through the Principal Paying Agent.

(g) The service of a Disposal Intention Notice does not oblige the Borrower Security Trustee or its Representative to
enter into and/or otherwise consent to any proposed Relevant Disposal referred to therein and the Borrower Security
Trustee will incur no liability by giving or withholding such consent.

Agreements are secured in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee pursuant to the Borrower Deed of Charge entered into on

Borrower Security Trustee is required to enforce the Borrower Security by appointing an administrative receiver following
receipt of actual notice of an application for the appointment of an administrator or actual notice of intention to appoint an
administrator, the Borrower Security Trustee has agreed that it is adequately indemnified and secured in respect of such

The circumstances which may lead to the security granted under the Woburn Deed of Charge being enforced are set
out in the section “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement” above.

_Appointment of an administrative receiver — CP Woburn Opco_

The Woburn Deed of Charge contains provisions (provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement) that require the
Borrower Security Trustee to appoint an administrative receiver to block the appointment of an administrator on the terms and
subject to the conditions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement. See paragraph 26.5 (“Appointment of Receiver to block an
_administrator — Obligor level”) in the section “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement”_
above.

The Borrower Security Trustee is not and will not be obliged to appoint an administrative receiver unless it is
indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. However, the Woburn Deed of Charge provides that, in the event that the
Borrower Security Trustee is required to enforce the Borrower Security by appointing an administrative receiver following
receipt of actual notice of an application for the appointment of an administrator or actual notice of intention to appoint an
administrator, the Borrower Security Trustee has agreed that it is adequately indemnified and secured in respect of such
appointment by virtue of its rights against CP Woburn Opco under the Woburn Deed of Charge and the security which it has
in respect of such rights.

_Governing law_

The Woburn Deed of Charge and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are
governed by English law.

**Topco Payment Undertaking**

Pursuant to an amended and restated deed of undertaking to be entered into on the Third Closing Date, Topco will
undertake to pay to the Issuer an amount equal to the aggregate of:

(a) the then principal balance of the Class B Loans;

(b) any accrued but unpaid interest outstanding in respect of the Class B Loans;

(c) any Additional Amounts; and

(d) all other amounts (including, without limitation, any premium and interest on overdue amounts)
outstanding under the Class B IBLA,

(together the “Class B Payment Amount”), following the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event and/or a Class
B Loan Event of Default.

Failure by Topco to pay such amount will give the right to the Borrower Security Trustee (on instruction from the
Class B Note Trustee or, as the case may be, the Class B Noteholders) to enforce the Topco Share Security granted to the
Borrower Security Trustee by Topco over the shares Topco holds in CP Cayman Limited and the share security granted to the
Borrower Security Trustee by CP Cayman Limited over the shares it holds in Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited. The
proceeds from the enforcement of this share pledge must be effected in the most tax efficient manner at the relevant time as a
subscription of shares in the Borrowers who then have to use the funds to prepay the Class B Loan. The Class B Payment
Amount is also due if there is a Class B Loan Event of Default. The Borrowers will then apply such amounts in payment and/
or prepayment of amounts outstanding on the Class B IBLA.

The Issuer will apply all amounts received by it from the Borrowers or, as the case may be, Topco, in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. Topco will agree not to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim which it
might have against the Issuer.

The Topco Payment Undertaking and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it will be
governed by English law.

**Topco Share Security Agreement**

equitable mortgage and first fixed charge over the entire issued share capital of CP Cayman Limited and its other assets,
rights, and undertakings as security for the obligations of Topco under the Topco Payment Undertaking (the “Topco Share
**Security”). In addition, Topco will grant a first floating charge over all its property, assets and rights, present and future, in**

Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Tax Deed of Covenant, or any other related document designated in writing as
such by the Issuer, the Borrower Security Trustee and the Borrowers. The Issuer granted (in the Issuer Deed of Charge)
security over its whole right, title, interest and benefit under the Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco Share Security
Agreement to the Issuer Security Trustee for the benefit of the Class B Noteholders.

Pursuant to the terms of the Topco Share Security Agreement, the proceeds of enforcement are to be applied by the
Issuer Security Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Issuer Deed of Charge
respectively.

The Topco Share Security Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, Cayman Islands law.

**1.** **FORM, DENOMINATION AND TITLE**

1.1 Class B2 Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers (within the meaning of Rule 144A
under the Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Class B2 Rule 144A Global
**Notes”). Class B2 Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S will be**
represented by a global note in fully registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Class B2 Regulation S
**Global Note” and, together with the Class B2 Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Class B2 Global Notes”). The Class**

217


-----

B2 Global Notes have been deposited on behalf of the subscribers of the relevant Class B2 Notes with, and
registered in the name of a nominee for, a common depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for Clearstream
Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) and Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., (“Euroclear” and, together with
Clearstream, the “Clearing Systems”) on the Third Closing Date. Upon deposit of the Class B2 Global Notes, the
Clearing Systems credited each subscriber of Class B2 Notes with the principal amount of Notes of the relevant
class equal to the aggregate principal amount thereof for which it had subscribed and paid.

1.2 For so long as the Class B2 Notes are represented by a Class B2 Global Note and the Clearing Systems so permit,
the Class B2 Notes will be tradeable only in the minimum authorised denomination of £100,000 and higher integral
multiples of £1,000.

1.3 The Class B Registrar shall maintain a register in respect of the Class B2 Notes (the “Class B Register”) outside the
United Kingdom which shall be the sole register in respect of the Class B2 Notes in accordance with the provisions
of the Agency Agreement and shall record in the Class B Register the names and addresses of the Holders of the
Class B2 Notes, particulars of the Class B2 Notes and all transfers and redemptions thereof.

1.4 Title to the Class B2 Notes will pass by and upon registration in the Class B Register. The Holder of each Class B2
Note shall (except as otherwise required by a court of competent jurisdiction or applicable law) be treated as the
absolute owner of such Class B2 Note for all purposes.

1.5 Interests in a Class B2 Global Note will be transferable in accordance with the rules and procedures for the time
being of the relevant Clearing Systems and the regulations concerning the transfer of Class B2 Notes set out in the
Agency Agreement.

1.6 If, while any of the Class B2 Notes are represented by a Class B2 Global Note (a) the Issuer has been notified that
Euroclear and/or Clearstream have been closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason
of holiday, whether statutory or otherwise) or have announced an intention permanently to cease business or have in
fact done so and, in any such case, no successor clearing system satisfactory to the Class B Note Trustee is available
or (b) by reason of a change in Tax law (or the application or official interpretation thereof), which change becomes
effective on or after the Third Closing Date, the Issuer has or will become subject to adverse tax consequences
which would not be suffered were the Class B2 Notes in definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed by
two directors of the Issuer has been given to the Class B Note Trustee, then the Issuer will issue Class B2 Notes of
the relevant class in definitive form (“Class B2 Definitive Notes”) in exchange for such Class B2 Global Note (free
of charge to the persons entitled to them) within 30 days of the occurrence of the relevant event. These Class B2
Conditions and the Transaction Documents will be amended in such manner as the Class B Note Trustee and the
Issuer Security Trustee may require to take account of the issue of Class B2 Definitive Notes.

1.7 Class B2 Definitive Notes, if issued, will only be printed and issued in denominations of £100,000 and integral
multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. Such Class B2 Notes will be serially numbered and will be issued in
registered form.

1.8 The Issuer may, from time to time, create and issue Class B2 Further Notes (in accordance with Condition 19.1
(Class B2 Further Notes and Class B New Notes)) having the same terms and conditions as the Class B2 Notes in
all respects (or in all respects except for the first payment of interest). Such Class B2 Further Notes shall be
consolidated with the Class B2 Notes and form one series with all prior issues of the Class B2 Notes. In addition,
the Issuer may, from time to time, create and issue Class B New Notes (in accordance with Condition 19.1 (Class
B2 Further Notes and Class B New Notes)) having terms that differ from any Class B2 Notes and do not form a
single series with any of them.

1.9 Accordingly the Class B2 Notes may comprise a number of issues in addition to the initial issue of such Class B2
Notes and the Class B Notes may comprise one or more issues of Class B Notes in addition to the initial issue of
Original Class B Notes on the Closing Date and the Class B2 Notes on the Third Closing Date.

**2.** **STATUS, PRIORITY AND SECURITY**

**Status and relationship between the Class B2 Notes**

2.1(a) The Class B2 Notes constitute direct, secured, limited recourse and unconditional obligations of the Issuer and are
secured by the same security over the assets of the Issuer. The Class B2 Notes rank pari passu without preference or
priority amongst themselves but are subordinated to the Class A Notes only as to payment provisions and as to the
ranking of their interest in the security provided of, and pursuant to, the Issuer Deed of Charge, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Note Trust Deed.

(b) The Note Trust Deed contains provisions requiring the Class B Note Trustee to have regard to the Class B2
Noteholders equally as regards all rights, powers, trusts, authorities, duties and discretions of the Class B Note

218


-----

Trustee (except where expressly provided otherwise). If there is more than one sub-class of Class B Notes
outstanding, the Class B Note Trustee shall have regard to the interests of the Class B Noteholders as a class, subject
to Class B2 Condition 14 (Amendment, Supplement and Waiver).

(c) In the event of an issue of Class B2 Further Notes or Class B New Notes, the provisions of the Note Trust Deed,
these Class B2 Conditions, the Issuer Deed of Charge and the other Transaction Documents, including (in the case
of Class B New Notes) those concerning:

(i) the basis on which the Class B Note Trustee and/or the Issuer Security Trustee (as applicable) will be
required to exercise or perform their respective rights, powers, trusts, authorities, duties and discretions
(including in circumstances where, in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee, there is a conflict between
the interests of any of the Issuer Secured Creditors);

(ii) the circumstances in which the Class B Note Trustee and/or the Issuer Security Trustee (as applicable)
will become bound to take action, as referred to in Condition 9 (Class B Note Events of Default) and
Condition 11 (Enforcement);

(iii) the passing of effective Class B Extraordinary Resolutions; and

(iv) the order of the Issuer Pre-Acceleration Priority of Payments or of the Issuer Post-Acceleration Priorities
of Payment,

will be modified in such manner as the Class B Note Trustee considers necessary to reflect the issue of such Class
B2 Further Notes or, as the case may be, Class B New Notes and any new Transaction Documents entered into in
connection with such Class B2 Further Notes or, as the case may be, Class B New Notes and the ranking thereof
and of the claims of any party to any of such new Transaction Documents in relation to the Class B2 Notes.

(d) If any Class B2 Further Notes or Class B New Notes are issued, the Issuer will immediately advise the Central Bank
and the Irish Stock Exchange accordingly and procure the publication of a notice of the issue in accordance with
Condition 17 (Notice to Class B2 Noteholders).

(e) The Class B Note Trustee and the Issuer Security Trustee shall be entitled to assume, for the purpose of exercising
any right, power, trust, authority, duty or discretion under or in relation to these Class B2 Conditions or any of the
Transaction Documents, that such exercise will not be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class B2
Noteholders (or any class thereof) if the Rating Agencies have provided a Rating Agency Confirmation with respect
thereto.

(f) The Class B2 Notes are solely the obligation of the Issuer and are not the obligation of, nor guaranteed by, any of
the Class B Note Trustee, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Issuer Account Bank, the Cash Manager or the Principal
Paying Agent.

(g) Prior to the delivery of a Class B Note Acceleration Notice pursuant to Condition 9 (Class B Note Events of
Default), the Issuer shall be required to apply all amounts standing to the credit of the Issuer Transaction Account in
accordance with the Issuer Pre-Acceleration Priority of Payments, and following delivery of a Class B Note
Acceleration Notice, the Issuer Post-Acceleration Priorities of Payments.

**Security**

2.2(a) As continuing security for the payment or discharge of the Issuer Secured Liabilities (including, without limitation,
all monies payable in respect of the Class B2 Notes and otherwise under the Note Trust Deed and the Issuer Deed of
Charge (including, without limitation, any remuneration, expenses and other claims of the Class B Note Trustee, the
Issuer Security Trustee and any Receiver appointed thereunder)), the Issuer has entered into the Issuer Deed of
Charge to create as far as permitted by, and subject to compliance with, any applicable law, and has granted to the
Issuer Security Trustee, first-ranking fixed and floating charges over all the assets and undertaking of the Issuer in

Creditors.

(d) The Note Trust Deed contains provisions detailing the Class B Note Trustee’s obligations to consider the interests

otherwise or as referred to in Condition 15 (Indemnification and Exoneration of the Class B Note Trustee and the
Issuer Security Trustee)).

(e) In addition:

(i) Topco has entered into the Topco Security Documents to create, as far as permitted by and subject to

(f) The Class B2 Noteholders will share the benefit of the Topco Security constituted by the Topco Security
Documents, upon and subject to the terms thereof.

**Enforceable Security**

2.3(a) The Class B Note Trustee shall, in the event of the Issuer Security becoming enforceable as provided in and subject
to the Issuer Deed of Charge and the Intercreditor Agreement (if directed by the Class B Noteholders), direct the
Issuer Security Trustee to enforce its rights with respect to the Issuer Security (subject in all cases to the Class A
Notes having been discharged in full) but without any liability as to the consequence of such action and without
having regard to the effect thereof on, or being required to account for such action to, any particular Class B
Noteholder; provided that neither the Class B Note Trustee nor the Issuer Security Trustee shall be obliged to take
any action unless they are indemnified and/or secured to their satisfaction.

(b) After enforcement of the Issuer Security, the Issuer Security Trustee shall (to the extent that such funds are

**4.** **CLASS B2 INTEREST**

**Period of accrual**

4.1 Each Class B2 Note (or, in the case of the redemption of only part of a Class B2 Note, that part only of such Class
B2 Note) will cease to bear interest from (and including) the due date for redemption unless, upon due presentation
in accordance with Condition 6 (Payments), payment of the principal in respect of the Class B2 Note is improperly
withheld or refused or default is otherwise made in respect of the payment, in which event interest shall continue to
accrue as provided in the Note Trust Deed.

**Class B2 Interest Rate and Note Interest Payment Dates**

4.2(a) The Class B2 Notes bear interest on their respective Principal Amount Outstanding (i) from (and including) the
Exchangeable Note Issue Date until (but excluding) the Class B2 Note Step-Down Date at % per annum and
(ii) from (and including) the Class B2 Note Step-Down Date to (and including) the Class B2 Note Final Maturity
Date, at % per annum (in each case, the applicable “Class B2 Interest Rate”).

(b) The period from and including the Exchangeable Note Issue Date to (but excluding) the Note Interest Payment Date
occurring on 28 February 2016 and each period from (and including) a Note Interest Payment Date to (but
excluding) the next succeeding Note Interest Payment Date is called a “Note Interest Period”. For the purposes of
the foregoing, the Note Interest Payment Dates will be 28 February and 28 August of each year (each a “Note
**Interest Payment Date”), commencing on 28 February 2016. If, however, any such day is not a Business Day, the**
Note Interest Payment Date will instead be the next Business Day in that calendar month (if there is one) or the
preceding Business Day (if there is not).

(c) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the Issuer receives a payment of interest (whether in whole or in part) on the
Class B2 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, then the
Issuer will be obliged to make a corresponding payment of interest (in whole or in part, as the case may be) on the
Class B2 Notes on the corresponding Note Interest Payment Date. If on any Note Interest Payment Date, the amount
received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B2 Loan is not sufficient to pay the interest
accrued on the Class B2 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period in full, the amount of interest
accrued up to any such Note Interest Payment Date that is not paid by the Issuer on such Note Interest Payment
Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest being a “Deferred Interest Amount”) and such
Deferred Interest Amount shall continue to accrue interest at the then applicable Class B2 Note Interest Rate until it
is paid by the Issuer in full.

(d) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date:

(i) the Issuer receives a payment of interest on the Class B2 Loan from the Borrower in accordance with the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in excess of the amount of interest accrued on the Class B2
Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period; and

(ii) on such Note Interest Payment Date, a Deferred Interest Amount in respect of any prior Note Interest
Period remains outstanding,

then the Issuer shall apply such excess to reduce the then outstanding Deferred Interest Amount. Any accrued but
unpaid interest and the aggregate amount of all Deferred Interest Amounts then unpaid on the Class B2 Notes and
any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts (if any) shall be due and payable by the Issuer
in pounds sterling on the Class B2 Note Final Maturity Date.

222


-----

**Calculation of Class B2 Interest**

4.3 Interest in respect of the Class B2 Notes and interest payable in respect of any overdue amount of principal or
Deferred Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the applicable rate of interest to the aggregate Principal
Amount Outstanding of the Class B2 Notes or the aggregate amount of any overdue amount of principal or Deferred
Interest Amount, as the case may be, and on the basis of (a) the actual number of days in the period from (and
including) the date from which interest begins to accrue (being the Exchangeable Note Issue Date (in respect of the
first such period) or a Note Interest Payment Date (in respect of subsequent such periods)) (the “Class B2 Accrual
**Date”) to (but excluding) the date on which it falls due divided by (b) the actual number of days from (and**
including) the Class B2 Accrual Date to (but excluding) the next following Note Interest Payment Date multiplied
by two; provided that in respect of accrued interest to the first Note Interest Payment Date, interest shall be
calculated on the basis of the sum of: (A) (x) the actual number of days from (and including) the Exchangeable Note
Issue Date to (but excluding) 28 August 2015 divided by (y) the actual number of days from (and including)
28 February 2015 to (but excluding) 28 August 2015 multiplied by two and (B) (x) the actual number of days from
(and including) 28 August 2015 to (but excluding) 28 February 2016 divided by (y) the actual number of days from
(and including) 28 August 2015 to (but excluding) 28 February 2016 multiplied by two. The resulting figure shall
be rounded down to the nearest penny.

**5.** **REDEMPTION, PURCHASE AND CANCELLATION**

**Final Redemption**

5.1(a) Unless previously redeemed in full as provided in this Condition 5 (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation), the
Issuer shall redeem the Class B2 Notes at their aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding together with any accrued
but unpaid interest, Deferred Interest Amounts and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Class B2 Note Final Maturity Date.

(b) The Issuer may not redeem the Class B2 Notes in whole or in part prior to the Class B2 Note Final Maturity Date
except as provided below in Condition 5.2 (Redemption), Condition 5.3 (Optional Redemption for taxation or other
reasons) or Condition 5.4 (Early redemption following a Class B Loan Enforcement Event) but without prejudice to
Condition 9 (Class B Note Events of Default).

**Redemption**

5.2(a) The aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding on each of the Class B2 Notes shall be repaid by the Issuer, if the
Issuer has sufficient funds to enable it to do so, on the Class B2 Note Expected Maturity Date, subject to Condition
5.3 (Optional Redemption for taxation or other reasons), Condition 5.4 (Early redemption following a Class B Loan
Enforcement Event) and Condition 5.5 (Principal Amount Outstanding), as applicable.

(b) A failure of the Issuer to redeem in full the Class B2 Notes on the Class B2 Note Expected Maturity Date in
accordance with these Class B2 Conditions and/or the occurrence of a Class B Note Event of Default (or any event
which would constitute a Class B Note Event of Default but for Condition 9.2) will result in the Class B Note
Trustee having the right (subject to the Note Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement) at its discretion to, or
shall, upon the instruction of holders of at least 30% of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B
Notes direct the Borrower Security Trustee to exercise its rights under the Topco Payment Undertaking and the
Topco Security Documents (a “Class B Trigger Event”). The non-payment on the Class B2 Note Expected
Maturity Date of any principal amount which would otherwise be payable under this Condition 5.2 (Redemption)
shall not constitute a Class B Note Event of Default pursuant to Condition 9 (Class B Note Events of Default)
including, for the avoidance of doubt, where such non-payment occurs as a result of the Issuer not receiving any
payment due under the Class B2 Loan on the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date. If the Issuer receives (or is to
receive) any monies from the Borrowers under the Topco Payment Undertaking or the proceeds realised from any
enforcement of the Topco Security Documents, the Issuer shall upon giving not more than 10 nor less than 5
Business Days’ notice (which notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more

_Noteholders), apply such monies to redeem the Class B2 Notes at their Principal Amount Outstanding together with_
accrued but unpaid interest, Deferred Interest Amounts and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and Additional
Amounts, if any. In the event that there are insufficient amounts to redeem all of the Class B2 Notes then
outstanding, the Class B2 Notes shall be redeemed in part in the proportion with which the repayment amount bears
to the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B2 Notes then outstanding.

(c) If the proceeds realised following a Class B Trigger Event are insufficient to satisfy all amounts scheduled to be
paid under paragraph (a) above, the Issuer will be obliged to apply any further amounts, if any, it receives as a result
of and pursuant to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement to repay any outstanding amounts on the Class B2
Notes.

(d) In addition, promptly upon receipt by the Issuer of a notice of prepayment from a Borrower under the Class B

accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer shall give not more than 60 nor less than
10 days’ notice to the Class B2 Noteholders, the Class B Note Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent that it will
apply the principal funds received from the prepayment of the Class B2 Loan to redeem a corresponding Principal
Amount Outstanding of the Class B2 Notes together with accrued but unpaid interest, Deferred Interest Amounts
and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, on the aggregate Principal Amount
Outstanding of such Class B2 Notes at the applicable redemption prices set out in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement (and as described in “Description of the Class B Loan — Prepayment — Optional Prepayment” in the
Class B2 Note Offering Circular). Any redemption or notice under this Condition 5.2(d) will be subject to
satisfaction of any conditions precedent set forth in the notice of prepayment from the Borrowers under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
other conditions precedent.

(e) In the case of a partial redemption of Class B2 Notes, the Class B2 Notes to be redeemed (the “Class B2 Redeemed
**Notes”) will be selected individually by lot, in the case of Class B2 Redeemed Notes represented by Class B2**
Definitive Notes, and in accordance with the rules of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (to be reflected in the records of
Euroclear and Clearstream as either a pool factor or a reduction in nominal amount, at their discretion) in the case of
Class B2 Redeemed Notes represented by a Class B2 Global Note, not more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for
redemption (such date of selection, the “Selection Date”). In the case of Class B2 Redeemed Notes represented by
Class B2 Definitive Notes, a list of the serial numbers of such Class B2 Redeemed Notes will be published in
accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B2 Noteholders) not less than 15 days prior to the date fixed for
redemption. No exchange of the relevant Class B2 Global Note will be permitted during the period from (and
including) the Selection Date to (and including) the date fixed for redemption pursuant to this Condition 5.2(e) to
that effect shall be given by the Issuer to the Class B2 Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class
B2 Noteholders) at least five days prior to the Selection Date.

**Optional Redemption for taxation or other reasons**

5.3(a) If the Issuer at any time certifies the Class B Note Trustee immediately prior to endeavouring to take the reasonable
measures available to it referred to below that:

(i) by reason of a change in tax laws or regulations (or the application or official interpretation thereof),
which change becomes effective on or after the Third Closing Date, on the next Note Interest Payment
Date, the Issuer would be required to deduct or withhold from any payment of principal, interest or other
amounts due and payable under the Class B2 Notes, any amount for or on account of any present or future
taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected,
withheld or assessed by the United Kingdom or Jersey or any political sub-division thereof or any
authority thereof or therein; or

(ii) by reason of a change in tax laws or regulations (or the application or official interpretation thereof),
which change becomes effective on or after the Third Closing Date, on the next Note Interest Payment
Date, the Borrowers under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement would be required to deduct or
withhold from any payment of principal, interest or other sum due and payable thereunder any amount for
or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever
nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the United Kingdom or any political subdivision thereof or any authority of either thereof or therein; or

(iii) by reason of a change in tax laws or regulations, which change becomes effective on or after the Third
Closing Date, it ceases to be a “securitisation company” (as defined in the Taxation of Securitisation
Companies Regulations 2006) or otherwise entitled to relief on any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed
by the United Kingdom or any political sub-division thereof or any authority thereof or therein for any
amount that it is obliged to pay and satisfies the Class B Note Trustee that such change will result in a
material rise in the tax liabilities of the Issuer; or

(iv) on or after the Third Closing Date, it has become or will become unlawful for the Issuer to make, fund or
allow to remain outstanding all or any advances made or to be made by it under the Class B Issuer/
Borrower Loan Agreement,

then the Issuer shall, in consultation with the Borrowers and the Class B Note Trustee, take reasonable measures to
avoid the effect of the relevant event described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, (including, without limitation,
appointing a Paying Agent in another jurisdiction and/or using its reasonable endeavours to arrange the substitution
of a company incorporated and/or tax resident in another jurisdiction (approved in writing by the Class B Note
Trustee) as principal debtor under the Class B2 Notes and as lender under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement); provided that the Class B Note Trustee is satisfied that taking such measures will not be materially
prejudicial to the interests of the Class B2 Noteholders.

224


-----

(b) If the Issuer satisfies the Class B Note Trustee immediately before giving the notice referred to below, that one or
more of the events described in (a) above is continuing and that the effect of the relevant event cannot be avoided by
the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it, then the Issuer may, on any Note Interest Payment Date and
having given not more than 60 nor less than 10 days’ notice (or, in the case of an event described in (a) above, such
shorter period expiring on or before the latest date permitted by relevant law) to the Class B Note Trustee and the
Class B2 Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B2 Noteholders) (notice being irrevocable),
redeem all, but not some, of the Class B2 Notes at their respective Principal Amount Outstanding together with
accrued but unpaid interest, Deferred Interest Amounts and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and
Additional Amounts, if any, up to but excluding the date of redemption. Prior to giving any notice of redemption
pursuant to this Condition 5.3 (Optional Redemption for taxation or other reasons), the Issuer shall deliver to the
Class B Note Trustee (A) a certificate signed by two directors of the Issuer stating that (x) one or more of the events
described in Clause (a) above is continuing and that the effect of the relevant event cannot be avoided by the Issuer
taking reasonable measures available to it, and (y) the Issuer will have the necessary funds to pay all principal and
interest due, if any, in respect of the Class B Notes on the relevant Note Interest Payment Date and to discharge all
other amounts required to be paid by it on the relevant Note Interest Payment Date in priority to, or pari passu with,
the Class B Notes under the Issuer Priorities of Payments; and (B) if required by the Class B Note Trustee, an
opinion (in form and substance satisfactory to the Class B Note Trustee) of independent legal advisors of recognised
standing opining on the relevant event described in (a) and (a)(i), (a)(ii), (a)(iii), and (a)(iv). The Class B Note
Trustee shall be entitled to accept such certificate and (if applicable) such opinion as sufficient evidence of the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent set out in (x) and (y) above, and it shall be conclusive and binding on the
Class B2 Noteholders.

**Early redemption following a Class B Loan Enforcement Event**

5.4 If the Issuer receives (or is to receive) any monies from any Obligor following the service of a Class B Loan
Enforcement Notice in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement in repayment of all or any part of the Class B2
Loan, the Issuer shall, upon giving not more than 10 nor less than 5 Business Days’ notice to the Class B Note
Trustee, the Issuer Secured Creditors and the Class B2 Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to
Class B2 Noteholders), apply such monies in accordance with the Issuer Pre-Acceleration Priority of Payments or
the Issuer Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable, and redeem (to the extent of such monies as are
available in accordance with the relevant Issuer Priorities of Payments) each Class B2 Note then outstanding at its
aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding plus accrued but unpaid interest, Deferred Interest Amounts and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, on the relevant date for payment. In the event
there are insufficient monies to redeem all the Class B2 Notes the Class B2 Notes shall be redeemed in part in the
proportion with which the repayment amount bears to the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B2
Notes then outstanding.

**Principal Amount Outstanding**

5.5(a) The Principal Amount Outstanding of a Class B2 Note on any date shall be its original principal amount less the
amount of all principal payments (excluding premium payable in accordance with Condition 5.2 (Redemption)), in
respect of such Class B2 Note which have been paid since the Third Closing Date except if and to the extent that
any such payment has been improperly withheld or refused.

(b) Each determination by or on behalf of the Issuer of the amount of any Class B2 Note principal payment and the
aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of a Class B2 Note shall in each case (in the absence of wilful default, bad
faith or demonstrable or manifest error) be final and binding on all persons. As soon as practicable following a
determination of a Class B2 Note principal payment and/or the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of a Class
B2 Note, the Issuer will cause such determination of a Class B2 Note principal payment and/or the aggregate
Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class B2 Note to be notified to the Class B Note Trustee, the Class B
Registrar and the Principal Paying Agent and will cause notice of each such determination to be given to Class B2
Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B2 Noteholders).

**Notice of Redemption**

5.6 Any such notice as is referred to in Condition 5.3 (Optional Redemption for taxation or other reasons) and
Condition 5.4 (Early redemption following a Class B Loan Enforcement Event) shall be irrevocable and, upon the
expiration of such notice, the Issuer shall be bound to redeem the relevant Class B2 Notes at the applicable amounts
specified in these Class B2 Conditions.

**No purchase by the Issuer**

5.7(a) The Issuer will not be permitted to purchase any Class B2 Notes. However the Obligors may purchase any Class B2
Notes subject to the satisfaction of the terms set out in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (and as
described in “Description of the Class B2 Loan — Certain Covenants — Class B2 Restricted Payment” in the Class
B2 Note Offering Circular).

225


-----

(b) If an Obligor purchases any Class B2 Notes then it must immediately transfer such Class B2 Notes to the Issuer in
satisfaction, prepayment and discharge of an amount of such Obligor’s liability under the Class B2 Loan equal to
the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B2 Notes transferred by that Obligor together with accrued but
unpaid interest, Deferred Interest Amounts and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and Additional
Amounts, if any, up to but excluding the date of transfer.

**Cancellation**

5.8 Any Class B2 Notes redeemed by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 5.6 (Notice of Redemption) or Condition
16 (Replacement of Class B2 Notes), or transferred to the Issuer pursuant to Condition 5.7 (No purchase by the
Issuer) will be cancelled forthwith. Any Class B2 Notes so redeemed or transferred may not be reissued or resold
and the obligations of the Issuer in respect of any such Class B2 Notes shall be discharged.

**6.** **PAYMENTS**

**General**

6.1(a) Payments of principal or premium (if any) in respect of the Class B2 Notes will be made to the holder (or the first
named of joint holders) of such Class B2 Note against presentation and surrender of the relevant Class B2 Note at
the specified office of the Class B Registrar by transfer to an account denominated in sterling with a bank in
London.

(b) Interest, Deferred Interest Amounts and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B2 Notes scheduled to be paid on
any Note Interest Payment Date will be paid to the holder (or the first named if joint holders) shown in the register
of Class B2 Noteholders as at the close of business on the fifteenth day before the date scheduled for payment
thereof (the “Record Date”). Payment of interest, Deferred Interest Amounts and Additional Amounts, if any, on
each Class B2 Note will be made by transfer to an account denominated in sterling with a bank in London.

(c) A record of each payment so made will be endorsed on the schedule to the Class B2 Global Note by or on behalf of
the Principal Paying Agent or the Class B Registrar, as the case may be, which endorsement shall be prima facie
evidence that such payment has been made.

**Method of Payment**

6.2 Payments will be made by credit or transfer to an account in sterling maintained by the payee with a bank in
London.

**Payments subject to Applicable Laws**

6.3 All payments are subject in all cases (i) to any applicable fiscal or other laws, regulations and directives, but without
prejudice to the provisions of this Condition 6 (Payments) and (ii) any withholding or deduction required pursuant
to FATCA. No commission or expenses shall be charged to the Class B2 Noteholders in respect of such payments.

6.4 The holder of a Class B2 Global Note shall be the only person entitled to receive payments of principal and interest
on the Class B2 Global Notes (as the case may be) and the Issuer will be discharged by payment to, or to the order
of, the holder of such Class B2 Global Note in respect of each amount paid.

**Payment only on a Class B Payment Business Date**

6.5 Where payment is to be made by transfer to an account, payment instructions (for value the date scheduled for
payment, or, if the date scheduled for payment is not a Class B Payment Business Day, for value the next
succeeding Class B Payment Business Day) will be initiated (i) (in the case of payments of principal and interest
payable on redemption) on the later of the due date for payment and the day on which the relevant Class B2 Note is
surrendered (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsed) at the specified office of a Class B Paying Agent and
(ii) (in the case of payments of interest to be paid other than on redemption) on the date scheduled for payment. A
Holder of a Class B2 Note shall not be entitled to any interest or other payment in respect of any delay in payment
resulting from the due date for a payment not being a Class B Payment Business Day.

**“Class B Payment Business Day” means:**

(a) a day on which banks in the relevant place of presentation are open for presentation and payment of debt securities
and for dealings in foreign currencies; and

(b) in the case of payment by transfer to an account, a day on which dealings in foreign currencies may be carried on in

**Initial Paying Agents and Class B Registrar**

6.6 The names of the Principal Paying Agent and the Class B Registrar and their respective initial specified offices are
set out at the end of these Class B2 Conditions. The Issuer reserves the right, subject to the prior written approval of
the Class B Note Trustee, at any time to vary or terminate the appointment of any Paying Agent or the Class B
Registrar and to appoint additional or other Paying Agents or Class B Registrars (including in circumstances where
the Principal Paying Agent, any Paying Agent or the Class B Registrar does not become, or ceases to be, a
Participating FFI or otherwise exempt from withholding or deduction of any Taxes (as that term is defined in
Condition 7 below) in respect of FATCA at a time when the Issuer would be required to withhold or deduct any
amount from any payment made by it to the Principal Paying Agent, any Paying Agent or the Class B Registrar
pursuant to FATCA) provided that:

(a) there will at all times be a person appointed to perform the obligations of the Principal Paying Agent and
the Class B Registrar;

(b) so long as the Class B2 Notes are listed on an exchange, there will at all times be at least one Paying
Agent (which may be the Principal Paying Agent) having its specified office in such place as may be
required by the rules and regulations of the relevant stock exchange and competent authority;

(c) the Issuer undertakes that it will ensure that it maintains a Paying Agent in a Member State of the
European Union that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to European Council Directive
2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced
in order to conform to such Directive; and

(d) the Issuer will use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that at any time the Issuer would otherwise be
required to withhold tax on payments to the Principal Paying Agent or any other Paying Agent pursuant to
FATCA, the Principal Paying Agent and any other Paying Agents are Participating FFIs or are otherwise
exempt from withholding or deduction of any Taxes (as that term is defined in Condition 7 below) in
respect of FATCA.

6.7 Notice of any termination, variation or appointment and of any changes in specified offices will be given to the
Class B2 Noteholders promptly by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B2 Noteholders).

**7.** **TAXATION**

All payments in respect of the Class B2 Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer shall be made without withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature
(“Taxes”), unless the withholding or deduction of the Taxes is required by applicable law. In such event, the Issuer shall
account to the relevant authorities for the amount required to be withheld or deducted. In such event, the Issuer will pay such
additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the Class B2 Noteholders after the
withholding or deduction shall equal the respective amounts which would have been receivable in respect of the Class B2
Notes in the absence of the withholding or deduction; provided that no such additional amounts will be paid on account of:

(a) any Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any actual or deemed (pursuant to
applicable Tax law of the relevant Tax jurisdiction) present or former connection between the Class B2
Noteholder or the beneficial owner of the Class B2 Notes (including, if applicable, a connection between
partners (in the case of a partnership) or shareholders (in the case of a corporation)) and the relevant Tax
jurisdiction (including being a resident of such jurisdiction for Tax purposes), other than holding of such
Class B2 Note, the enforcement of rights under such Class B2 Note or the receipt of any payments in
respect of such Class B2 Note;

(b) any Taxes imposed as a result of the presentation of a Class B2 Note for payment more than 30 days after
the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Class B2 Noteholder (except to the extent
that the holder would have been entitled to additional amounts had the Class B2 Note been presented on
the last day of such 30 day period);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, personal property, transfer or similar Taxes;

(d) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to an individual that are required to be made
pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC, or any law implementing or complying with or
introduced in order to conform to, such directive;

(e) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a Class B2 Noteholder or beneficial owner of
Class B2 Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the
relevant Class B2 Note to a Class B Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

227


-----

(f) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to, the
Class B2 Notes;

(g) any Taxes imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Class B2 Noteholder or beneficial owner of
Class B2 Notes, to comply with any reasonable written request of the Issuer or the Class B Paying Agent
addressed to the Class B2 Noteholders and made at least 30 days before any such withholding or
deduction would be payable to satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting
requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a relevant Tax
jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of,
Taxes imposed by the relevant Tax jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the Class
B2 Noteholder or beneficial owner is not resident in the relevant Tax jurisdiction), but in each case, only
to the extent the Class B2 Noteholder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification
or documentation;

(h) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment to the Class B2 Noteholder if such Class B2
Noteholder is a fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to
the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had such Class B2 Noteholder been
the sole beneficial owner of such Class B2 Notes;

(i) any Taxes payable under FATCA; or

(j) any combination of items (a) through (i) above.

**8.** **PRESCRIPTION**

8.1 Claims in respect of principal and interest on the Class B2 Notes will be prescribed after ten years (in the case of
principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the Relevant Date in respect of the relevant payment.

8.2 In this Condition 8 (Prescription), the “Relevant Date”, in respect of a payment, is the date on which such payment
first becomes due or (if the full amount of the monies payable on that date has not been duly received by the
Principal Paying Agent or the Class B Note Trustee on or prior to such date) the date on which, the full amount of
such monies having been received, notice to that effect is duly given to the relevant Class B2 Noteholders in
accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B2 Noteholders).

**9.** **CLASS B NOTE EVENTS OF DEFAULT**

9.1 Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Class B Note Trustee at its absolute discretion may, and if so directed in
writing by the holders of at least 30% of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B Notes then

each case, to being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction in accordance with the Note Trust Deed) give a
notice (a “Class B Note Acceleration Notice”) to the Issuer declaring all of the Class B2 Notes immediately due

(b) below) on any Class B2 Notes, when due; or

(b) default being made for a period of 30 days or more in the payment of interest, Deferred Interest Amounts
and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon or Additional Amounts (if any), on the Class B2 Notes, when
due; or

(c) the Issuer failing to duly perform or observe any other obligation, condition, provision, representation or
warranty binding on it under the Class B2 Notes, Note Trust Deed, the Issuer Deed of Charge or any of
the other Transaction Documents and such failure being in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee (or, in
the case of the Issuer Deed of Charge, the Issuer Security Trustee), capable of remedy, but which remains
unremedied for a period of 21 days following the giving of notice by the Class B Note Trustee (or the
Issuer Security Trustee, as applicable) to the Issuer requiring the same to be remedied and, in either case;
**provided that the Class B Note Trustee shall have determined that such event is, in its opinion, materially**
prejudicial to the interests of the Class B2 Noteholders; or

(d) an Issuer Insolvency Event; or

(e) the delivery of the Class A Note Acceleration Notice in accordance with Condition 2.3 (Enforceable
Security) of the Class A Conditions; or

228


-----

(f) it is or will become unlawful for the Issuer to perform or comply with its obligations under or in respect of
these Class B2 Conditions or any Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

9.2 Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, until the earlier of (i) the date on which all Class A Notes are redeemed in
full and (ii) the date on which the Class A Notes are accelerated, the occurrence of any of the events or
circumstances described in Condition 9.1 above, which otherwise give rise to a Class B Note Event of Default, will
not constitute a Class B Note Event of Default, but will constitute a Class B Trigger Event under Condition 5.2(b).

**10.** **ACCELERATION**

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, upon delivery of a Class B Note Acceleration Notice, the Class B2 Notes
shall become immediately due and payable at their Principal Amount Outstanding together with accrued interest, if any,

accordance with these Class B2 Conditions.

**11.** **ENFORCEMENT**

**Service of notice**

11.1(a) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, at any time after the service of a Class B Note Acceleration Notice by the
Class B Note Trustee in accordance with Condition 9 (Class B Note Events of Default) above, the Class B Note
Trustee at its absolute discretion may, and if so directed in writing by the holders of at least 30% in aggregate
Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B Notes then outstanding, or if so directed by a Class B Extraordinary
Resolution of the Class B Noteholders shall (subject, in each case, to being indemnified and/or secured to its
satisfaction in accordance with the Note Trust Deed), instruct the Issuer Security Trustee to take enforcement steps
in relation to the Issuer Security.

(b) Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Issuer Deed of Charge, if the Class B Note Trustee provides
the Issuer Security Trustee with a copy of a Class B Note Acceleration Notice given to the Issuer and instructs it to
take enforcement steps in relation to the Issuer Security, the Issuer Security Trustee is required to give a notice (the
“Class B Note Enforcement Notice”) to the Issuer declaring the whole of the Issuer Security to be enforceable.

**No Class B Note Events of Default**

11.2 The Issuer, pursuant to the terms of the Note Trust Deed, shall provide on a semi-annual basis written confirmation
to the Class B Note Trustee that no Class B Note Event of Default has occurred.

**12.** **LIMITED RECOURSE**

12.1 Notwithstanding any other Condition or any provision of any Transaction Document, all obligations of the Issuer to
the Class B2 Noteholders are limited in recourse to the property, assets and undertakings of the Issuer that are the

into cash;

(b) all amounts available from the Issuer Secured Property have been applied to meet or provide for the
relevant obligations specified in, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Issuer Deed of Charge; and

them which remain unpaid (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payments of principal and/or interest in respect of
the Class B2 Notes) and such unpaid amounts shall be discharged in full and any relevant payment rights shall be
deemed to cease.

**13.** **NON-PETITION**

Trustee or the Issuer Security Trustee or a Receiver), shall have any right to take or initiate any proceedings or steps

229

attachment, execution or diligence, provided that nothing shall prevent a Class B2 Noteholder from proving for the
full amount owed to it by the Issuer in the insolvency of the Issuer.

13.2 No Class B2 Noteholder, nor any person acting on behalf of a Class B2 Noteholder (other than the Issuer Security
Trustee or any Receiver appointed by the Issuer Security Trustee), shall initiate or join any person in initiating
howsoever an Issuer Insolvency Event and it shall not be entitled to take any steps or proceedings which would
result in any of the provisions described in the Intercreditor Agreement or this Condition not being observed.

Security Trustee to agree, without the consent of the Class B2 Noteholders, to any modification which, in the
opinion of the Class B Note Trustee is:

(a) to correct a manifest error or to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency of a formal, minor or
technical nature;

(b) to make any change that would provide the Class B2 Noteholders with any additional benefits or rights, or
that does not adversely affect the legal rights of any such holder in any material respect;

(c) to allow any member of the Group established or incorporated after the Closing Date to become an
Obligor;

(d) to provide the issuance of Class B Additional Notes in accordance with Condition 19 (Further Notes and
New Notes); or

(e) to provide for a successor Class B Note Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Note Trust Deed.

14.6 Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Class B Note Trustee may also, without the consent of the
Class B2 Noteholders, determine that a Class B Note Event of Default or a Share Enforcement Event shall not, or
shall not subject to specified conditions, be treated as such.

14.7 Any such modification, waiver, authorisation or determination shall be binding on the Class B2 Noteholders and,
unless the Class B Note Trustee agrees otherwise, any such modification shall be notified to the Class B2
Noteholders as soon as practicable thereafter in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B2 Noteholders).

14.8 The Class B Note Trustee shall be entitled to take into account, for the purpose of exercising or performing any
right, power, trust, authority, duty or discretion under or in relation to these Class B2 Conditions or any of the
Transaction Documents, among other things, to the extent that it considers, in its sole and absolute discretion, it is
necessary and/or appropriate, and/or relevant, any Rating Agency Confirmation (whether or not such confirmation
is addressed to, or provides that it may be relied upon by, the Class B Note Trustee and irrespective of the method
by which such confirmation is conveyed).

14.9 Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement in connection with any such substitution of principal debtor as is
referred to in Condition 5.3 (Optional Redemption for taxation or other reasons), the Class B Note Trustee and the
Issuer Security Trustee may also agree, without the consent of the Class B2 Noteholders, to a change in the laws
governing the Class B2 Notes, these Class B2 Conditions and/or the Transaction Documents, provided that such
change would not, in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class
B2 Noteholders.

14.10 Where the Class B Note Trustee is required to have regard to the interests of the Class B2 Noteholders, it shall have
regard to the interests of such Class B2 Noteholders as a class and, in particular but without prejudice to the
generality of the foregoing, shall not have regard to, or be in any way liable for, the consequences of such exercise
for individual Class B2 Noteholders resulting from their being for any purpose domiciled or resident in, or
otherwise connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any particular territory, and the Class B Note Trustee
shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Class B2 Noteholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer to any other
person, any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual
Class B2 Noteholders.

14.11 If and wherever the Issuer shall have issued and have outstanding more than one sub-class of Class B Notes, the
provisions of this Condition 14 shall have effect subject to the following modifications:

(a) a resolution which in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee affects only one sub-class of Class B Notes
shall be deemed to be duly approved if approved through a single vote of the holders of that sub-class of
Class B Notes;

(b) a resolution which in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee affects the holders of more than one subclass of Class B Notes but does not give rise to a conflict of interest between the holders of any sub-class
of Class B Notes so affected shall be deemed to have been duly approved if approved through (as a single
Class) a vote of the holders of all the sub-classes of Class B Notes so affected;

(c) a resolution which in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee affects the holders of more than one subclass of Class B Notes and gives or may give rise to a conflict of interest between the holders of one subclass of Class B Notes so affected and the holders of another sub-class of Class B Notes shall be deemed
to have been duly approved only if approved through a separate vote of the holders of each of the subclasses of Class B Notes;

231


-----

(d) in respect of all approvals all the preceding provisions of this Condition shall apply mutatis mutandis as
though references to Class B Notes and Class B Noteholders were references to the sub-class of Class B
Notes in question or to the holders of such sub-class of Class B Notes, as the case may be; and

(e) no Class B Extraordinary Resolution involving a Class B Basic Terms Modification (other than where
such Class B Basic Terms Modification affects only one sub-class of Class B Notes) that is approved by
the holders of one sub-class of Class B Notes shall be effective unless it is approved by a Class B
Extraordinary Resolution of the holders of each other sub-class of Class B Notes (to the extent there are
Class B Notes outstanding in each such other sub-class).

**15.** **INDEMNIFICATION AND EXONERATION OF THE CLASS B NOTE TRUSTEE AND THE ISSUER SECURITY TRUSTEE**

15.1 The Note Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement contain provisions governing the responsibility (and relief
from responsibility) of the Class B Note Trustee and the Issuer Security Trustee, respectively, and providing for
their indemnification in certain circumstances, including provisions relieving them from taking enforcement
proceedings or, in the case of the Issuer Security Trustee, enforcing the Issuer Security unless indemnified and/or
secured to their satisfaction.

15.2 The Note Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement also contain provisions pursuant to which the Class B Note
Trustee and the Issuer Security Trustee and their related companies are entitled, amongst other things, to (a) enter
into business transactions with the Issuer and/or any other party to any of the Transaction Documents and to act as
trustees for the holders of any other securities issued or guaranteed by, or relating to, the Issuer and/or any other
party to any of the Transaction Documents, (b) exercise and enforce its rights, comply with its obligations and
perform its duties under or in relation to any such transactions or, as the case may be, any such trusteeship without
regard to the interests of, or consequences for, the Class B2 Noteholders, and (c) retain and not be liable to account
for any profit made or any other amount or benefit received thereby or in connection therewith.

**16.** **REPLACEMENT OF CLASS B2 NOTES**

If any Class B2 Note is mutilated, defaced, lost, stolen or destroyed, it may be replaced at the specified office of the
Paying Agent. Replacement of any mutilated, defaced, lost, stolen or destroyed Class B2 Note will only be made on payment
of such costs, by the respective Class B2 Noteholder, as may be incurred in connection therewith and on such terms as to
evidence and indemnity as the Issuer may reasonably require. Mutilated or defaced Class B2 Notes must be surrendered
before new ones will be issued.

**17.** **NOTICE TO CLASS B2 NOTEHOLDERS**

17.1 Any notice shall be deemed to have been duly given to the Class B2 Noteholders if sent to the Clearing Systems for
communication by them to the holders of the Class B2 Notes and shall be deemed to be given on the date on which
it was so sent and shall also be published in the following manner. In respect of Class B2 Definitive Notes, any
notice to the Class B2 Noteholders shall be validly given if published in a leading daily newspaper printed in the
English language and with general circulation in London and Ireland (which is expected to be the Financial Times
and in the Irish Times, respectively) and (so long as the relevant Class B2 Notes are admitted to trading on and
listed on an exchange), any notice shall also be published in accordance with the relevant listing rules and
regulations of such exchange.

17.2 Class B2 Noteholders will be deemed for all purposes to have notice of the contents of any notice given to the
holders of Class B2 Notes in accordance with this Condition 17 (Notice to Class B2 Noteholders).

17.3 A copy of each notice given in accordance with this Condition 17 (Notice to Class B2 Noteholders) shall be
provided to the Rating Agencies, and so long as the Class B2 Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, to the
Irish Stock Exchange (to the extent required by the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange).

17.4 The Class B Note Trustee shall be at liberty to sanction some other method of giving notice to the Class B2
Noteholders if, in its opinion, such other method is reasonable having regard to market practice then prevailing and
to the requirements of the stock exchange on which the relevant Class B2 Notes are then admitted to trading and
listed and provided that notice of such other method is given to the Class B2 Noteholders in such manner as the
Class B Note Trustee shall require.

**18.** **NOTIFICATION**

As soon as practicable after becoming aware that any part of a payment of interest or principal on the Class B2
Notes will be deferred or that a payment previously deferred will be made in accordance with these Class B2 Conditions, the
Issuer will give notice thereof to the Class B2 Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B2 Noteholders),
and so long as the Class B2 Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, to the Irish Stock Exchange (to the extent required
by the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange).

**19.** **FURTHER NOTES AND NEW NOTES**

**Class B2 Further Notes and Class B New Notes**

19.1(a) The Issuer may, without the consent of the Class B2 Noteholders, but subject always to the provisions of these Class
B2 Conditions and the Note Trust Deed, at its option, raise further funds, from time to time, on any date by the
creation and issue of:

(i) further Class B2 Notes carrying the same terms and conditions in all respects (or in all respects except in
relation to the first Note Interest Period and first Note Interest Payment Date, the issue date, first coupon
and initial Principal Amount Outstanding) as, and so that the same shall be consolidated and form a single
series and rank pari passu with, the Class B2 Notes (the “Class B2 Further Notes”); and/or

(ii) new Class B Notes which may equally have terms and conditions that differ from the Class B2 Notes and
which do not form a single series with the Class B2 Notes (the “Class B New Notes”).

(b) It shall be a condition precedent to issue any Class B2 Further Notes and/or Class B New Notes (together, the
“Class B Additional Notes”) that:

(i) the aggregate principal amount of all such Class B Additional Notes to be issued on such date is not less
than £5.0 million;

(ii) the Rating Agencies have confirmed that any Class B Additional Notes are assigned the same ratings (or
better) as are then applicable to the Class B Notes with which they are to be consolidated and form a
single series;

(iii) the Rating Agencies have provided a Rating Agency Confirmation in respect of the Class B2 Notes in
relation to the issue of Class B2 Further Notes or, as the case may be, Class B New Notes (provided that
no such Rating Agency Confirmation is required on the then existing Class B Notes where the purpose of
the Class B New Notes and the related loan to the Borrowers under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement is to refinance the Class B2 Loan and the Class B2 Notes in full);

(iv) an amount equal to the gross proceeds of such Class B2 Further Notes or, as the case may be, the Class B
New Notes (with an amount in respect of any issue expenses or commissions agreed to be paid by way of
fee by the Borrowers pursuant to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) is applied by the Issuer to
make a loan to the Borrowers pursuant to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the conditions
precedent therein for an advance under any Additional Class B Facilities are satisfied;

(v) the Class B Note Trustee has received a legal opinion satisfactory to it in relation to, inter alia, the issue
of the Class B2 Further Notes, or as the case may be, the Class B New Notes from a reputable
international law firm; and

(vi) no Class B Note Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (which has not been waived) or would
occur as a result of such issue.

(c) Nothing in this Condition 19 (Class B2 Further Notes and Class B New Notes) prohibits the Issuer from issuing
Class A Further Notes and/or Class A New Notes in accordance with the Class A Conditions.

**Deeds and Security**

19.2 Any such Class B Additional Notes will be constituted by a further deed or deeds supplemental to the Note Trust
Deed and have the benefit of the security constituted by the Issuer Deed of Charge. Any of the Transaction
Documents may be amended as provided in Condition 2.1(c) (Status and relationship between the Class B2 Notes)
or otherwise, and further Transaction Documents may be entered into, in connection with the issue of such Class B
Additional Notes and the claims of any of the parties to any amended Transaction Document or any further
Transaction Document may rank pari passu with or behind, the Class B2 Notes, provided, in each case, that the
conditions set out in Condition 19.1(a) have been satisfied, mutatis mutandis.

**20.** **CLASS B CALL OPTION**

20.1 The Class B2 Notes are issued with the benefit of the Class B Call Option (as defined in and set out in the
Intercreditor Agreement).

20.2 If a Class B Call Option Trigger Event occurs, then subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Class B Call
Option and the other terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Class B2 Noteholder will be entitled (but not

233


-----

obliged) to purchase all (but not some only) of the then outstanding Class A Notes at a price equal to the then
aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class A Notes together with accrued but unpaid interest.

20.3 Following notification of the occurrence of any Class B Call Option Trigger Event by or on behalf of the Issuer to
the Class B2 Noteholders (such notification, the “Class B Call Option Notice”), any Class B2 Noteholders who
wish to exercise the Class B Call Option must comply with the terms (as to procedures and timing for payment and
settlement) set out in the Class B Call Option Notice in order to purchase the Class A Notes in such proportions as
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement may specify.

**21.** **EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION**

**Notice of redenomination**

21.1 The Issuer may, without the consent of the Class B2 Noteholders, and on giving at least 30 days’ prior notice to the
Class B2 Noteholders, the Class B Note Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent, designate a date (the
“Redenomination Date”), being a Note Interest Payment Date falling on or after the date on which the UK
becomes a participating Member State.

**Redenomination**

21.2 Notwithstanding the other provisions of these Class B2 Conditions, with effect from the Redenomination Date:

(a) the Class B2 Notes denominated in sterling (the “Class B2 Sterling Notes”) shall be deemed to be
redenominated into euro in the denomination of €0.01 with a principal amount for each Class B2 Note
equal to the principal amount of that Class B2 Note in sterling, converted into euro at the rate for
conversion of such currency into euro established by the Council of the European Union pursuant to the
Treaty establishing the European Union, as amended (including compliance with rules relating to
rounding in accordance with European Community regulations), provided, however, that, if the Issuer
determines, that the then current market practice in respect of the redenomination into €0.01 of
internationally offered securities is different from that specified above, such provisions shall be deemed to
be amended so as to comply with such market practice and the Issuer shall promptly notify the Class B2
Noteholders, the Irish Stock Exchange (or any stock exchange (if any) on which the Class B2 Notes are
then listed) and the Principal Paying Agent of such deemed amendments;

(b) if Class B2 Notes have been issued in definitive form:

(i) all Class B2 Notes denominated in sterling will become void with effect from the date (the
“Euro Exchange Date”) on which the Issuer gives notice (the “Euro Exchange Notice”) to the
Class B2 Noteholders and the Class B Note Trustee that replacement Class B Notes
denominated in euro are available for exchange (provided that such Class B2 Notes are
available) and no payments will be made in respect thereof;

(ii) the payment obligations contained in all Class B2 Notes denominated in sterling will become
void on the Euro Exchange Date but all other obligations of the Issuer thereunder (including the
obligation to exchange such Class B2 Notes in accordance with this Condition 21 (European
Economic and Monetary Union)) shall remain in full force and effect; and

(iii) new Class B2 Notes denominated in euro will be issued in exchange for Class B2 Sterling Notes
in such manner as the Issuer may specify and as shall be notified to the Class B2 Noteholders in
the Euro Exchange Notice;

(c) all payments in respect of the Class B2 Sterling Notes will be made solely in euro by credit or transfer to a
euro account (or any other account to which euro may be credited or transferred) maintained by the payee
with a bank in the principal financial centre of any Member State; and

(d) a Class B2 Note may only be presented for payment on a day which is a business day in the place of
presentation.

**Interest**

21.3 Following redenomination of the Class B2 Notes pursuant to this Condition 21 (European Economic and Monetary
Union) where Class B2 Sterling Notes have been issued in definitive form, the amount of interest due in respect of
the Class B2 Sterling Notes will be calculated by reference to the aggregate principal amount of the Class B2
Sterling Notes presented for payment by the relevant holder and the amount of such payment shall be rounded down
to the nearest €0.01.

234


-----

**22.** **SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE**

The Class B2 Notes, and the rights of the Class B Note Trustee and the Class B2 Noteholders under the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Issuer Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be of further effect as to all outstanding Class
B2 Notes when (1) (i) all the Class B2 Notes have become due and payable or (ii) will become due and payable at the Class
B2 Note Expected Maturity Date or the Class B2 Note Final Maturity Date, in each case within one year or (iii) are to be
called for redemption or prepayment within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Class B Note Trustee
for the giving of notice of redemption by the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Issuer
Security Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Issuer Security Trustee for this purpose), an
amount in Sterling sufficient to pay and discharge the entire outstanding principal amount on the Class B2 Notes, together
with any redemption premium, if any, accrued and unpaid interest, Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon, to the date of deposit (in the case of Class B2 Notes that have become due and payable), or to the
Class B2 Note Expected Maturity Date, the Class B2 Note Final Maturity Date or prepayment date, as the case may be; (3) the
Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Class B2 Condition with respect to the Class B2 Notes;
(4) the Issuer has delivered an irrevocable notice of redemption to the Class B2 Noteholders and has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Issuer Security Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Issuer Security Trustee
for this purpose) to apply the funds deposited towards the payment of the Class B2 Notes, at maturity or on the redemption
date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Issuer Security Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate (which the
Issuer Security Trustee may rely on without further inquiry and without liability) to the effect that all conditions precedent
under these Class B2 Conditions relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Class B2 Notes have been complied with.

**23.** **NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of Topco or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Topco, Issuer or any Guarantor under the Class B Finance
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Class B2
Noteholder by accepting a Class B2 Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Class B2 Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**24.** **RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES**

No rights are conferred under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of the Class B2
Notes or these Class B2 Conditions, but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party which exists or is available
apart from the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

**25.** **GOVERNING LAW**

Each of the Transaction Documents, the Class B2 Global Notes and these Class B2 Conditions (and, in each case,
any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the relevant document) are governed by, and shall be
construed in accordance with, English law (other than the Issuer Jersey Corporate Services Agreement, the Issuer Deed of
Charge (to the extent governed by Jersey law), the Security Interest Agreement and the Topco Share Security Agreement,
which will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, Jersey law and Cayman Islands law, respectively).

**26.** **JURISDICTION**

The courts of England are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute including any dispute as to any noncontractual obligations that may arise out of or in connection with the Class B2 Notes and the Transaction Documents (save to
the extent governed by Jersey law) to which the Issuer is party and, accordingly, any legal action or proceedings arising out of
or in connection with the Class B2 Notes and/or the Issuer Transaction Documents may be brought in such courts. The Issuer
has in each of the Issuer Transaction Documents to which it is a party irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE CLASS B2 LOAN**

_Under the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer will agree to make available to the_
_Borrowers on the Third Closing Date the facilities as described below. The following is a summary of certain provisions of_
_the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. It is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of the Class_
_B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. Capitalised terms used, but not defined in this “Description of the Class B2 Loan” shall_
_have the meaning given to them in the section “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” or “Terms and Conditions_
_of the Class B2 Notes” set out in this Offering Circular, as applicable._

On the Third Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Class B2 Notes will be applied by the Issuer to make
advances to the Borrowers in an aggregate principal amount of £560,000,000 pursuant to the terms of the Class B Issuer/
Borrower Loan Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the Issuer will provide to the Borrowers a secured facility in an
aggregate principal amount of £560,000,000 (the “Class B2 Facility” and the advance thereunder, the “Class B2 Loan”)
which will be contractually subordinated to the Class A Facilities pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The economic terms and conditions of the Class B2 Facility (including, among other things, in relation to the
payment of interest and the repayment and prepayment of principal) will be broadly similar to the terms and conditions of the
Class B2 Notes.

On the Third Closing Date, the only Unrestricted Subsidiary under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement
will be Forest Cayco Topco Limited, a liquidated non-trading entity whose dissolution will be effective as of September 4,
2015.

**REPAYMENT**

The Borrowers must repay the Class B2 Loan in full on the Class B2 Loan Final Maturity Date to the extent not
repaid, prepaid or otherwise discharged in full prior to that date.

The occurrence of the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date does not in and of itself result in any outstanding
principal amounts under the Class B2 Loan becoming due. However, if, on the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date the
Class B2 Loan remains outstanding, Topco will be required, under the terms of the Topco Payment Undertaking, to procure
the payment of an amount equal to the aggregate of:

(a) the then outstanding aggregate principal balance on the Class B Loans;

(b) accrued but unpaid interest then outstanding in respect of the Class B Loans; and

(c) all other amounts due and payable by the Obligors to the Issuer under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement.

Failure by Topco to pay such amount will give the right to the Borrower Security Trustee (on instruction from the
Class B Note Trustee as directed by the Class B Noteholders) to enforce the Topco Security granted to it (on trust for the
Issuer) by Topco over the shares Topco holds in Holdco and the shares Holdco holds in Intermediate Holdco, in each case in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**PREPAYMENT**

**Optional prepayment**

At any time prior to 2017, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions prepay up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Class B2 Loan at a prepayment price equal to % of the principal amount of the Class
B2 Loan prepaid upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the date of prepayment (subject to the rights of the Issuer to receive interest on the relevant Loan Interest
Payment Date), with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, provided that:

(1) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the initial Class B2 Loan remains outstanding
immediately after the occurrence of such prepayment; and

(2) the prepayment occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time prior to 2017, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions, at their option, prepay all or a
part of the Class B2 Loan upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a prepayment price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the Class B2 Loan prepaid, plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of prepayment (subject to the rights of the Issuer to receive interest due on the relevant
Loan Interest Payment Date).

236


-----

Except as described in the first and second paragraphs above and set out under “— Taxes — Repayment for taxation
_reasons”, the Class B2 Loan will not be pre-payable at the Borrowers’ option prior to_ 2017.

On or after 2017, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions prepay all or a part of the Class B2 Loan
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at the prepayment prices (expressed as percentages of principal
amount) set out below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amount, if any, and any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B2 Loan prepaid, to (but excluding) the applicable date
of prepayment, if prepaid during the 12-month period beginning on of the years indicated below, subject to the rights
of the Issuer to receive interest on the relevant Loan Interest Payment Date:

**Year** **Redemption Price**

2017 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %

Unless the Borrowers default on the payment of the prepayment price, interest will cease to accrue on the Class B2
Loan or portions thereof called for prepayment on the applicable prepayment date.

Any prepayment or notice may, at the Borrowers’ discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent.

Upon any prepayment of the Class B2 Loan pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer will redeem a pro rata portion of
the Class B2 Notes in accordance with the Class B2 Conditions.

**Mandatory Prepayment**

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Borrowers shall, within one Business Day of receipt of any monies
received by the Borrowers under the Topco Payment Undertaking, apply such monies to prepay the maximum amount of the
Class B Loans (together with all accrued and unpaid interest, Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amount, if any, and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon, and Additional Amounts, if any) that may be prepaid with such monies.

**INTEREST**

**Calculation of interest**

The rate of interest on the Class B2 Loan for each Loan Interest Period (as defined below) is the percentage per
annum as follows:

(1) in respect of any Loan Interest Period falling in the period starting on (and including) the Exchangeable
Note Issue Date and terminating on (and excluding) the Class B2 Loan Step-Down Date, % per
annum; and

(2) in respect of any Loan Interest Period falling after (and including) the Class B2 Loan Step-Down Date up
to (but excluding) the Class B2 Loan Final Maturity Date, % per annum,

(each, the applicable “Class B2 Interest Rate”).

The period from (and including) the Exchangeable Note Issue Date to (but excluding) the first Loan Interest
Payment Date and each successive period from (and including) a Loan Interest Payment Date to (but excluding) the next
succeeding Loan Interest Payment Date, is called a “Loan Interest Period”.

**Payment of interest**

Subject to the following two paragraphs, the Borrowers must pay accrued interest on the Class B2 Loan on each
Loan Interest Payment Date.

From (and including) the Exchangeable Note Issue Date to (but excluding) the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity
Date (as defined below), interest will accrue on any overdue amount of principal or interest (including Additional Amounts, if
any) in respect of the Class B2 Loan at the applicable Class B2 Interest Rate. For the avoidance of doubt, any failure to pay
interest on a Loan Interest Payment Date will not constitute a Class B Loan Event of Default for as long as any Class A Notes
remain outstanding but will constitute a Share Enforcement Event. The “Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date” will be
the date falling three Business Days prior to the Class B2 Note Expected Maturity Date. The “Class B2 Note Final Maturity
**Date” will be the Note Interest Payment Date falling on 28 February 2042.**

237


-----

From (and including) the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date, interest will accrue on the principal amount of the
Class B2 Loan at the applicable Class B2 Interest Rate until (but excluding) the Class B2 Loan Final Maturity Date but such
accruing interest will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest being a “Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest
**Amount”) and such Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amount shall accrue interest at the then applicable Class B2 Interest**
Rate until it is paid by the Borrowers in full. On each Loan Interest Payment Date, interest accrued on the Class B2 Loan
Deferred Interest Amount during the immediately preceding Loan Interest Period shall be added to the then outstanding
Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and thereafter paid at the times and in the same manner as the Class B2 Loan
Deferred Interest Amount. The Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon will be
payable by the Borrowers only on the earlier of (x) the date on which the Class A Loans are repaid in full (the “Initial
**Payment Date”) and (y) the Class B2 Note Final Maturity Date (as defined below); provided that if on the Initial Payment**
Date, the Borrowers do not have sufficient cash to pay the Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon in full on such date in accordance with the Borrower Priorities of Payments, any unpaid Class B2 Loan
Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon will not fall due then but will continue to be deferred
and will only fall due for payment on any subsequent Loan Interest Payment Date to the extent of the cash available to the
Borrowers for such purpose determined in accordance with the Borrower Priorities of Payments. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Class B2 Loan, any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, any Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon may be repaid prior to the Class B2 Note Final Maturity Date using (A) New Equity
Funds received by the Borrowers, (B) funds available following the enforcement of the Topco Security, and/or (C) following
the enforcement of the Transaction Security to the extent funds are available for this purpose pursuant to the applicable
Priorities of Payments (as described under “Intercreditor Agreement”).

**PAYMENTS**

Unless a Class B Finance Document specifies that payments under it are to be made in another manner (including
any payments in specie pursuant to Condition 5.7 of the Class B2 Conditions), all payments by any Obligor to the Issuer
under the Class B Finance Documents must be made to the Issuer Transaction Account (or such other account as the Issuer or,
following a Class B Loan Event of Default, the Borrower Security Trustee may specify to the Borrowers by not less than ten
Business Days’ prior written notice).

**TAXES**

**Additional Amounts**

In the event that (i) any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes is required to be made from
payments made by the Issuer under or with respect to the Class B2 Notes and (ii) the Issuer is required under the Class B2
Conditions to pay additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) on the Class B2 Notes such that the net amounts received
by each holder of Class B2 Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction in respect
of such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments in
the absence of such withholding or deduction, the Issuer shall promptly give written notice of such requirement to the
Borrowers and each Borrower will pay such Additional Amounts as specified in such notice as may be necessary for the
Issuer to comply with its obligations under the Class B2 Conditions.

Each Obligor must make all payments to be made by it under the Class B Finance Documents without any Tax
Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by law.

If an Obligor or the Issuer (or any permitted assignee) is aware that an Obligor must make a Tax Deduction (or that
there is a change in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction), it must promptly notify the other Parties.

If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by an Obligor, the amount of the payment due from the Obligor
will be increased by an amount (also an Additional Amount) that (after making the Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to
the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.

If an Obligor is required to make a Tax Deduction, that Obligor must make the minimum Tax Deduction allowed by
law and must make any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction within the time allowed by law.

Within 30 days of making either a Tax Deduction or a payment required in connection with a Tax Deduction, the
Obligor making that Tax Deduction or payment must deliver to the Issuer evidence satisfactory to the Issuer that the Tax
Deduction has been made or (as applicable) the appropriate payment has been paid to the relevant taxing authority.

**Repayment for taxation reasons**

The Borrowers may repay the Class B2 Loan in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ notice to the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee (which notice will be irrevocable) at a repayment
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, Class B2 Loan Deferred

238


-----

Interest Amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date fixed for repayment (a “Tax
**Repayment Date”) (subject to the right of the Issuer to receive interest due on the relevant Loan Interest Payment Date) and**
all Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Repayment Date as a result of the repayment
or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer, Borrowers or Guarantors determine in good faith that, the Issuer has the right to redeem the
Class B2 Notes upon the occurrence of any of the events listed in Condition 5.3 of the Class B2 Conditions as set out in the
Note Trust Deed. The Borrowers will promptly notify the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee if they elect to repay the
Class B2 Loan pursuant to this covenant. If the Borrowers so elect to repay the Class B2 Loan, the Borrowers will deliver to
the Borrower Security Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such repayment and setting forth a
statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to repay have been satisfied. The Borrower Security
Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described
above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers and thereafter the
Borrowers must repay or prepay the Class B2 Loan in full on the date specified in the next paragraph below and the Issuer
will redeem all of the Class B2 Notes in accordance with the Class B2 Conditions.

The date for repayment or prepayment of the Class B2 Loan will be the earlier of:

(i) the Loan Interest Payment Date in respect of the then current Loan Interest Period; or

(ii) the date specified by the respective Borrowers in their notification.

**CLASS B2 CHANGE OF CONTROL**

If a Class B2 Change of Control occurs, the Borrowers will make an offer to the holders of the Class B2 Notes (a
“Class B2 Change of Control Offer”) to repurchase all or any part (equal to £100,000 or an integral multiple of £1,000 in
excess thereof) of the Class B2 Notes held by such holders. In the Class B2 Change of Control Offer, the Borrowers will offer
a payment equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Class B2 Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amount, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, and Additional Amounts, if any,
on the Class B2 Notes repurchased to the date of purchase (the “Class B2 Change of Control Payment”), subject to the
rights of holders of Class B2 Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date;
_provided, however, that the Borrowers will not be obliged to repurchase the Class B2 Notes as described under this “— Class_
_B2 Change of Control” covenant in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to prepay all of_
the Class B2 Loan as described under “Prepayment — Optional Prepayment” or all conditions to such repurchase have been
satisfied or waived.

Unless the Borrowers have unconditionally exercised their right to repay all of the Class B2 Loan as set out in
“— Prepayment — Optional prepayment” or all conditions to such repayment have been satisfied or waived, within 30 days
following any Class B2 Change of Control, the Borrowers will be obliged to deliver a notice to the Issuer, the Class B Note
Trustee and each holder of the Class B2 Notes in accordance with the Class B2 Conditions, stating:

(1) that a Class B2 Change of Control Offer is being made and that all Class B2 Notes tendered will be
accepted for payment;

(2) the purchase price and the prepayment date, which shall be no earlier than 10 days and no later than
60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the “Class B2 Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) that any Class B2 Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) that, unless the Borrowers default in the payment of the Class B2 Change of Control Payment, all Class
B2 Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Class B2 Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest after the Class B2 Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that holders of Class B2 Notes electing to have any Class B2 Notes purchased pursuant to a Class B2
Change of Control Offer will be required to transfer the Class B2 Notes to the nominated account as
specified in the notice of the Class B2 Change of Control Offer;

(6) that holders of Class B2 Notes will be entitled to withdraw their election if they deliver notice to the
Borrower (at such facsimile number or address as specified in the notice of the Class B2 Change of
Control Offer), not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Class B2
Change of Control Payment Date, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of
Class B2 Notes, the principal amount of Class B2 Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such
holder is withdrawing its election to have the Class B2 Notes purchased; and

(7) that holders of Class B2 Notes whose Class B2 Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new
Class B2 Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Class B2 Notes surrendered,
which unpurchased portion must be equal to £100,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of
£1,000 in excess thereof.

239


-----

The Borrowers will be required to comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those
laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the purchase of the Class B2 Notes as a result of a Class B2 Change of
Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions described in this
section, the Borrowers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached their obligations under the provisions described in this section by virtue of such compliance.

On the Class B2 Change of Control Payment Date, to the extent lawful:

(1) the Borrowers will accept for purchase all or portions of Class B2 Notes properly tendered pursuant to the
Class B2 Change of Control Offer;

(2) the Borrowers will deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Class B2 Change of Control
Payment in respect of all or portions of Class B2 Notes properly tendered by such holder for payment into
the account of each tendering holder of Class B2 Notes (as specified in such holder’s acceptance of the
Class B2 Change of Control Offer) no later than five days after the Class B2 Change of Control Payment
Date and no later than 60 days from the date the notice set forth in the second paragraph of this covenant
has been mailed to holders of Class B2 Notes; and

(3) the Borrowers will deliver or cause to be delivered to the Issuer (in satisfaction, prepayment and discharge
of a pro rata portion of each Borrowers’ liability under the Class B2 Loan) the Class B2 Notes properly
accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Class B2 Notes
being purchased by the Borrowers and the Issuer shall then deliver such Class B2 Notes to the Paying
Agent and shall take all other actions and deliver all documents and certificates as are required under the
Note Trust Deed or requested by the Paying Agent to effect a cancellation of such Class B2 Notes.

The Borrowers will not be required to make a Class B2 Change of Control Offer upon a Class B2 Change of
Control if (1) a third party makes the Class B2 Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set out in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement applicable to a Class B2 Change of
Control Offer made by the Borrowers and purchases all Class B2 Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the
Class B2 Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to “— Prepayment — Optional
_prepayment”, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price by the Borrowers in connection_
with the repayment of the Class B2 Loan or by the Issuer in connection with the redemption of a pro rata portion of the
Class B2 Notes.

The Issuer will be required to cooperate with the Borrowers in connection with any Class B2 Change of Control
Offer (including, without limitation, by delivering such notices to the Class B Note Trustee and the holders of Class B2 Notes
as the Borrowers may require in order to enable the Borrowers to comply with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph),
and the Borrowers will bear the cost of any such Class B2 Change of Control Offer.

**CERTAIN COVENANTS**

**Class B Financial Covenant**

_Required Class B FCF DSCR_

Subject to “— Cure right” as set out below, the Borrowers must ensure that, on each Financial Covenant Test Date,
the ratio of Class B FCF to the Class B Total Debt Service Charges (such ratio, expressed as a percentage, the “Class B FCF
**DSCR”) for the applicable FCF DSCR Period is equal to or greater than 100%.**

In respect of the calculation of the Class B FCF DSCR on the first and second Financial Covenant Test Date after
the Third Closing Date: (i) the Class B Total Debt Service Charges for the relevant FCF DSCR Period will be deemed to be
equal to the actual annualised Consolidated Interest Expense payable by Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries with effect
from the Third Closing Date; and (ii) EBITDA shall be calculated on a pro forma basis as if CP Woburn (Operating
Company) Limited constituted a Restricted Subsidiary for the whole of the relevant FCF DSCR Period.

For these purposes each of Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall set their Accounting Periods such that the end
date of each Accounting Period immediately preceding each Financial Covenant Test Date shall be a date which is not more
than 12 weeks prior to such Financial Covenant Test Date.

_Cure right_

If:

(1) as at a Financial Covenant Test Date (as described in this paragraph, the “Relevant Financial Covenant
**Test Date”), the Class B FCF DSCR is less than 100%;**

240


-----

(2) within the period of 30 days thereafter, the Borrowers procure that either:

(A) the Class A Loans and/or the Class B Loans are prepaid in part; and/or

(B) funds are deposited into (or remain in) the Defeasance Account,

using or having been funded by New Equity Funds (the amount so prepaid or deposited, the “Class B
**Specified Amount”); and**

(3) the Recalculated Class B FCF DSCR is not less than 100%,

then for all purposes thereafter (including, without limitation, as to any determination of the occurrence of a Share
Enforcement Event or a Class B Loan Event of Default) the Class B FCF DSCR as at the Relevant Financial Covenant Test
Date shall be deemed to have been the same as the Recalculated Class B FCF DSCR.

The Borrower Security Trustee must, as soon as is reasonably practicable after being so requested, but in any event
not earlier than the Business Day following the Financial Covenant Test Date immediately following the Relevant Financial
Covenant Test Date, consent to the release of funds from the Defeasance Account (deposited in the Defeasance Account
pursuant to the preceding paragraph) if and to the extent that, following such release, the Recalculated Class B FCF DSCR
(disregarding the Class B Specified Amount (if any) requested to be so released) remains at or greater than 100% (as certified
by CP Opco in the Class B Compliance Certificate to be provided in connection with such Relevant Financial Covenant Test
Date).

**Limitation on Financial Indebtedness**

Topco will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Financial Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness), provided, however, that Topco and any Obligor may Incur Financial Indebtedness if the
Issuer obtains a Rating Agency Confirmation in respect of the Class B2 Notes.

Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Financial Indebtedness”):

underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such
refinancing;

### (ii) (A) Guarantees by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Financial Indebtedness of Topco or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in each case so long as the Incurrence of such Financial

(B) without limiting the provisions described in “— Limitations on Liens”, Financial Indebtedness
arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Financial
Indebtedness of Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries so long as the Incurrence of such
Financial Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement;

(iii) Financial Indebtedness of Topco owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Financial
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by Topco or by any Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided, however, that:_

such Financial Indebtedness must be unsecured and expressly subordinated to the extent
required by the Intercreditor Agreement to the prior payment in full of the Obligations under the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(B) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
such Financial Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than Topco or a
Restricted Subsidiary of Topco; and

(C) any sale or other transfer of any such Financial Indebtedness to a Person other than Topco or a
Restricted Subsidiary of Topco,

shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Financial Indebtedness by
Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, not permitted as described in this
clause (iii);

and assumption of related liabilities) Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and (b) Incurred to

Charge Coverage Ratio would be greater than 2.0 to 1.0 after giving effect to such acquisition or other
transaction or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower than it was immediately prior to
giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction on a pro forma basis;

(vii) Financial Indebtedness represented by Capitalised Lease Obligations or Purchase Money Obligations, and
in each case any Refinancing Financial Indebtedness in respect thereof, in an aggregate outstanding

Preference Shares or an Excluded Contribution) of Topco, in each case, subsequent to the Third Closing
Date; provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be
excluded for purposes of making Class B2 Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of this covenant
and clauses (i), (vi) and (x) of the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “— Class B2
_Restricted Payments” to the extent Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Financial Indebtedness in_
reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for
purposes of Incurring Financial Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (xix) to the extent Topco or any of its

_Payments” in reliance thereon._

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Financial

(i) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Financial Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Financial Indebtedness shall not be included;

(ii) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any credit facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clauses (i), (vii) or (xii) of the
second paragraph of this covenant and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relate to other Financial Indebtedness, then such other Financial Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(iii) [reserved];

(iv) Financial Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be Incurred solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Financial Indebtedness but may be Incurred in part by one such provision and in
part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Financial Indebtedness;

243


-----

(v) the amount of Financial Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS;

(vi) for the avoidance of doubt, the Incurrence of any Financial Indebtedness by Topco will only be permitted
if it also complies with the provisions described in “— Limitation on Holding Company Activities”;

(vii) subject to clause (iii) above and (viii) below, in the event that Financial Indebtedness meets the criteria of
more than one of the types of Financial Indebtedness described in first and second paragraphs of this
covenant, Topco, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of
Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in the first
paragraph or second paragraph of this covenant;

(viii) all Financial Indebtedness outstanding on the Third Closing Date under the Class A Loans and the
Class B2 Loan shall be deemed initially Incurred on the Third Closing Date under clause (iv)(A) of the
second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph of this covenant or clause (iv)(B) of the
second paragraph of this covenant, and without limiting any permitted refinancing pursuant to clause
(iv)(C) of the second paragraph of this covenant, may not be reclassified pursuant to clause (vii) of this
paragraph;

(ix) no Financial Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant shall be used to
refinance, refund, replace, repay, exchange or extend any Financial Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to
clause (i) of the second paragraph of this covenant; and

(x) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of
a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase
price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference
thereof.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortisation of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Financial Indebtedness, the payment of dividends on Preferred
Stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Financial Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be
deemed to be an Incurrence of Financial Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. The amount of any Financial
Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (i) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Financial Indebtedness issued
with original issue discount and (ii) the principal amount or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Financial
Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Financial Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of Topco as of such date (and, if such Financial
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, Topco shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Financial
Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of Financial Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall
be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Financial Indebtedness was Incurred, in
the case of term Financial Indebtedness, or, at the option of Topco, first committed, in the case of Financial Indebtedness
Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (i) if such Financial Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other
Financial Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable
sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of
such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal
amount of such Refinancing Financial Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Financial Indebtedness
being refinanced; (ii) the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Financial Indebtedness outstanding on the
Third Closing Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Third Closing Date; and
(iii) if and for so long as any such Financial Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in
which such Financial Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Financial Indebtedness, the amount
of such Financial Indebtedness, if denominated in sterling, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made
under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Sterling Equivalent of such amount plus the Sterling Equivalent of any
premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement. For purposes of calculating
compliance with clause (i) of the second paragraph (of this covenant or for calculating the amount of Financial Indebtedness
outstanding under any Credit Facility, to the extent a Credit Facility is utilised for the purpose of Guaranteeing or cash
collateralising any letter of credit or Guarantee, such Guarantee or collateralising and issuance of such letter of credit or
Guarantee shall be deemed to be a utilisation of such Credit Facility permitted under clause (i) of the second paragraph above.

Subject to the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, any Borrower may at any time serve written
notice to the Issuer with a copy to the Borrower Security Trustee requesting from the Issuer such further and/or additional
term loan facilities, each in a maximum aggregate principal amount not exceeding the principal amount of any issue of
Class B Additional Notes issued by the Issuer to fund its obligations under the Class B Issuer/ Borrower Loan Agreement in

respect of the relevant additional Class B Facility (each an “Additional Class B Facility”) if the following conditions are
satisfied (as certified by the Borrower), or will be satisfied by the time of such issue:

(1) the aggregate amount of any Additional Class B Facility is to be for a minimum aggregate principal
amount of £5.0 million;

(2) the conditions to the issue by the Issuer of the corresponding Class B Additional Notes have been
satisfied, or will be satisfied by the time of such issue;

(3) the payment of interest and principal with respect to any such Additional Class B Facilities will rank pari
passu with or after any then outstanding Class B Facility; and

(4) the Incurrence of Financial Indebtedness under such Additional Class B Facility is permitted under
“— Limitation on Financial Indebtedness”.

Notwithstanding the provisions described above, the maximum amount of Financial Indebtedness that Topco or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur under the provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement shall not be deemed to
be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Financial
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Financial Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Financial
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which
such Refinancing Financial Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of the relevant refinancing.

in such Unrestricted Subsidiary, which amount, in each case under this clause (4), was included
in the calculation of the amount of Class B2 Restricted Payments referred to in clause (iii) of the
first paragraph of this covenant;

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in the preceding clause (1) of this definition to the_
extent that it is (at Topco’s option) included under this clause (4); plus

246

stock ownership plan or trust established by Topco or any Subsidiary of Topco for the benefit of
its employees to the extent funded by Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary) of Capital Stock of
an Unrestricted Subsidiary of Topco; and

Subsidiary;

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in the preceding clause (1) to the extent that it is (at_
Topco’s option) included under this clause (5); provided further, however, that such amount shall not
exceed the amount of Class B2 Restricted Payments made in connection with such Unrestricted
Subsidiaries since the Exchangeable Note Issue Date pursuant to clause (3) above.

market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

“Cumulative Interest Expense” means, in respect of any Class B2 Restricted Payment, the sum of the aggregate
amount of Consolidated Interest Expense of Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the period from and after the first day of
the Accounting Period during which the Exchangeable Note Issue Date occurs to the end of Topco’s most recently ended
Accounting Period for which financial statements are available at the time of the proposed Class B2 Restricted Payment.

Financial Indebtedness or other obligations owed to an Obligor;

249

(ii) make any loans or advances to an Obligor; or

(iii) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to an Obligor;

_provided that (A) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or_
liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (B) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill
requirements to) loans or advances made to Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Financial Indebtedness Incurred by
Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions described in the paragraph above will not prohibit:

(i) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (A) any Credit Facility or (B) any other agreement or
instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Third Closing Date, including the Class A

referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph or this clause (iii) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained
in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of this
paragraph or this clause (iii); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favourable in any
material respect to the holders of the Class B2 Notes, taken as a whole, than the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or
amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by Topco);

(iv) any encumbrance or restriction:

(A) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, licence or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any

Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Third Closing Date as described in to
“— Limitation on Financial Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such
agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favourable to the holders of the Class B2
Notes than (A) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement or the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, together with the security documents
associated therewith as in effect on the Third Closing Date; (B) any encumbrance or restriction contained
in the Credit Facility, together with the security documents associated therewith as in effect on the Third

unless:

(i) Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of
relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at

of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise,
other than Financial Indebtedness) received by Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is
in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments. For the purposes of this provision,
each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(A) the assumption by the transferee of Financial Indebtedness of Topco or Financial Indebtedness
of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of Topco or an Obligor) and
the release of Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Financial
Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale;

(B) securities, notes or other obligations received by Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary of Topco
from the transferee that are converted by Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale;

(C) Financial Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as
a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that Topco and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any Guarantee of payment of such Financial Indebtedness in connection with
such Asset Sale;

(D) consideration consisting of Financial Indebtedness of Topco (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) received after the Third Closing Date and that is cancelled from Persons who are
not Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(E) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not
to exceed the greater of £18.0 million and 1.0% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of
each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); and

252


-----

(iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Sale is applied by Topco or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(A) to the extent Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required by
the terms of any Financial Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary), (1) to prepay, repay,
redeem or purchase any Financial Indebtedness under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement, any Financial Indebtedness Incurred under clause (i) of the second paragraph
described under “— Limitation on Financial Indebtedness” (or any Refinancing Financial
Indebtedness in respect thereof) or any other Financial Indebtedness secured by a first priority
Lien on the Collateral within 365 days from the later of (x) the date of such Asset Sale and
(y) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection with any
prepayment or repayment of Financial Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (1), Topco or such
Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Financial Indebtedness and will cause the related
commitment (if any) (except in the case of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) to be
permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid or repaid; (2) to
prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Financial Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not
a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in
each case, other than Subordinated Indebtedness of Topco or a Guarantor or Indebtedness that is
owed to Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary); (3) to purchase the Class B2 Notes pursuant to an
offer to all holders of Class B2 Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the
principal amount of the Class B2 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including,
the date of purchase; or (4) to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a
price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment or purchase; provided
that Topco shall redeem repay or repurchase Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to this clause
(4) only if the Borrowers make (at such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant)
an offer to the holders of the Class B2 Notes to purchase their Class B2 Notes in accordance
with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer for an aggregate principal amount of
Class B2 Notes at least equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of
Class B2 Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum of the total aggregate principal amount of
Class B2 Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Pari
Passu Indebtedness; or

(B) to the extent Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary elects to invest in or commit to invest in
Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by Topco or another Restricted Subsidiary) within
365 days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Sale and (2) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash; provided, however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made
pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors
of Topco that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as
such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day; and provided, further, that,
if the Asset Sale relates to Collateral, to the extent such Additional Assets are of the same type
as any asset constituting Collateral, such Additional Assets are substantially, simultaneously
with their acquisition, pledged under the Borrower Security Documents, with the security
interest on such Additional Assets securing the Class B2 Loan and Class B2 Notes with the
same priority with respect to the Class B2 Loan and Class B2 Notes as the security interest on
the Collateral subject to the Asset Sale, provided that in the case of Net Available Cash received
from an Asset Sale of Collateral, none of the Obligors may apply such Net Available Cash to
repay Financial Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not an Obligor; or

(C) or consummate any combination of the foregoing,

_provided, further, that pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with_
clauses (A) or (B), Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Financial Indebtedness
or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Sales that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as
provided in clause (iii) above will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement. On or prior to the 366th day (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in clause (iii)(B) above has
been entered into) after an Asset Sale, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement exceeds £20.0 million, the Borrowers will be required to make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of
Class B2 Notes and, to the extent the Borrowers elect, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase,
prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of Class B2 Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset
Sale Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Class B2 Notes in an

253


-----

amount at least equal to (and, in the case of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the
principal amount of the Class B2 Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amount, if
any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this covenant or the
agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral
multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

Each Asset Sale Offer will remain open for a period of at least 20 Business Days following its commencement and
not more than 30 Business Days, except to the extent that a longer period is required by applicable law (the “Offer Period”).
No later than three Business Days after the termination of the Offer Period (the “Purchase Date”), the Borrowers will apply
all Excess Proceeds (the “Offer Amount”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of Class B2 Notes and, if applicable,
any such Pari Passu Indebtedness (on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount of Class B2 Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness surrendered, if applicable) or, if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Class B2 Notes and, if
applicable, other Financial Indebtedness tendered in response to the Asset Sale Offer. Payment for any Class B2 Notes and, if
applicable, any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, so purchased will be made in the same manner as interest payments are made. If
the Purchase Date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, any accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the Person in whose name a Class B2 Note is registered at the close of business on such
record date, and no additional interest will be payable to holders of Class B2 Notes who tender Class B2 Notes pursuant to the
Asset Sale Offer.

Upon the commencement of an Asset Sale Offer, the Borrowers shall (or upon request of the Borrowers, the Issuer
shall) send, by first class mail, a notice to the Issuer and (for the purposes of information only) to the Borrower Security
Trustee. The notice, which will govern the terms of the Asset Sale Offer, will state:

(i) that the Asset Sale Offer is being made pursuant to this covenant and the length of time the Asset Sale
Offer will remain open;

(ii) the Offer Amount, the purchase price and the Purchase Date;

(iii) that any Class B2 Note not tendered or accepted for payment will continue to accrue interest;

(iv) that, unless the Borrowers default in making such payment, any Class B2 Note accepted for payment
pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Purchase Date;

(v) that holders of Class B2 Notes electing to have a Class B2 Note purchased pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer
may elect to have Class B2 Notes purchased in integral multiples of £1,000 only (provided that Class B2
Notes of £100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part);

(vi) that holders of Class B2 Notes electing to have Class B2 Notes purchased pursuant to any Asset Sale
Offer will be required to transfer the Class B2 Notes to the nominated account as specified in the notice of
the Asset Sale Offer;

(vii) that holders of Class B2 Notes will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Issuer and/or the
Borrowers receive (at such facsimile number or address as specified in the notice of the Asset Sale Offer),
not later than the expiration of the Offer Period, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of
the holder of Class B2 Notes, the principal amount of Class B2 Notes delivered for purchase, and a
statement that such holder is withdrawing its election to have the Class B2 Notes purchased;

(viii) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Class B2 Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered
by holders thereof exceeds the Offer Amount, the Borrowers will select the Class B2 Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount of Class B2 Notes and
such Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered (with such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the
Borrowers so that only Class B2 Notes in denominations of £1,000, or integral multiples thereof, will be
purchased (provided that Class B2 Notes of £100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in
part)); and

(ix) that holders of Class B2 Notes whose Class B2 Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new
Class B2 Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Class B2 Notes surrendered,
which unpurchased portion must be equal to £100,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of
£1,000 in excess thereof.

On or before the Purchase Date, the Borrowers will, to the extent lawful:

(i) accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Offer Amount of Class B2 Notes or
portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer, or if less than the Offer Amount has been
tendered, all Class B2 Notes tendered;

254


-----

(ii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Issuer (in satisfaction, prepayment and discharge of a pro rata
portion of each Borrower’s liability under the Class B2 Loan) the Class B2 Notes properly accepted
together with an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Class B2 Notes or portions thereof were accepted
for payment by the Borrowers in accordance with the terms of this covenant and the Issuer shall then
deliver such Class B2 Notes to the Paying Agent and shall take all other action and deliver all documents
and certificates required under the Note Trust Deed or required by the Paying Agent to effect cancellation
of the Class B2 Notes; and

(iii) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the purchase price in respect of all Class B2 Notes or
portions of Class B2 Notes properly tendered by such holder for payment into the account of each
tendering holder of Class B2 Notes (as specified in such holder’s acceptance of the Asset Sale Offer) no
later than five days after the Purchase Date.

The Issuer shall cooperate with the Borrowers in relation to any Asset Sale Offer, and the Borrowers shall bear the
cost of such Asset Sale Offer (including, without limitation, by delivering such notices to holders of Class B2 Notes as the
Borrowers may require in order to enable the Borrowers to comply with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph).

If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. If
the aggregate principal amount of Class B2 Notes tendered into (or to be redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer
and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the
Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Class B2 Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis,
based on the aggregate principal amount of Class B2 Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered. Upon completion of each
Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Class B2 Notes is denominated in a
currency other than sterling, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Class B2 Notes shall not exceed the net amount of
funds in sterling that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into sterling.

Following any acceptance by the holders of Class B2 Notes of any Asset Sale Offer, the Borrowers will be required
to prepay the Class B2 Loan at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any) in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
aggregate principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any) of Class B2 Notes so tendered in such Asset Sale Offer.

**Transactions with Affiliates**

Topco will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to or sell, lease, transfer
or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or
amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or Guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any
Affiliate of Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or
consideration in excess of £5.0 million, unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favourable to Topco or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction
in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of £20.0 million, the terms of
such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (ii) of the first
paragraph of this covenant if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors. If there are
no Disinterested Directors, any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in this
covenant if Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to the Borrower Security Trustee a letter
from an Independent Financial Adviser stating that such transaction is fair to Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary from a
financial point of view or stating that the terms are not materially less favourable to Topco or its relevant Restricted
Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary with
an unrelated Person on an arm’s length basis.

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the
provisions of the first paragraph of this covenant:

(i) any Class B2 Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the provisions described in “— Class
_B2 Restricted Payments”, any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (ix)(B) of the definition_
of Permitted Payments) or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in
clauses (a)(ii), (b) and (o) of the definition thereof);

255


-----

(ii) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into,
or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, programme,
agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements,
options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of Topco, any Restricted Subsidiary of Topco
or any Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans,
participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health,
insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programmes or
arrangements) or payments of customary fees and reimbursements of expenses to, or indemnities provided
on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of Topco, in
each case in the ordinary course of business;

(iii) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(iv) any transaction between or among Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries;

(v) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including
under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,
directors, officers, consultants or employees of Topco, any Restricted Subsidiary of Topco or any Parent
(whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such
directors, officers or employees);

(vi) the entry into and performance of obligations of Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the
terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any
agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Third Closing Date, as these agreements and instruments
may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in
accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the holders
of the Class B2 Notes in any material respect and the entry into and performance of any registration rights
or other listing agreement in connection with any Public Offering;

(vii) the execution, delivery and performance of any tax sharing agreement to the extent not prohibited by the
definition of Permitted Payments or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax,
accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of business;

(viii) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, providers of employees or other labour
(including, without limitation, with respect to the management, development, maintenance or
refurbishment of real property and other related services), suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or
services (including, without limitation, with respect to insurance and reinsurance services), in each case in
the ordinary course of business, which are fair to Topco or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the
reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the senior management of Topco or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favourable than those that could reasonably have been
obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(ix) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary
and any Affiliate of Topco that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because Topco or a
Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any
Permitted Holder owns an Equity Interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate;

(x) (A) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of
Topco or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder
Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder
Funding are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in their reasonable
determination and (B) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated
Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement;

(xi) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (xii) hereof, (A) payments by Topco
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to any Parent or Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly,
including through any Parent) of customary annual management, consulting, monitoring or advisory fees
and related expenses and (B) customary payments by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to any
Parent or Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent) for financial
advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking
activities, including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which payments in respect of this
clause (B) are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors in good faith;

256


-----

(xii) payment to any Parent or Permitted Holder of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such
Parent or Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in Topco and its
Subsidiaries;

(xiii) the Incurrence or amendment of any Subordinated Shareholder Funding;

(xiv) transactions between any of the Obligors and any person, a director of which is also a director of the
relevant Obligor or any direct or indirect parent of such Obligor; provided, however, that such director
abstains from voting as a director of the relevant Obligor or such direct or indirect parent, as the case may
be, on any matter involving such other person;

(xv) any Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisation;

(xvi) the Transaction Documents;

(xvii) any transaction that is, directly or indirectly, related to the Woburn Site or an Additional Site and is
otherwise permitted by the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(xviii) any Affiliate Transaction with the Issuer provided it complies with the covenants set forth in the Note
Trust Deed;

(xix) the existence of, or the performance by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations under
the terms of, any stockholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or purchase
agreement related thereto) to which it (or any Parent of the Topco) is a party as of the Third Closing Date
and any similar agreements which it (or any Parent of Topco) may enter into thereafter; provided that the
existence of, or the performance by the Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or such Parent) of
obligations under any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar agreement
entered into after the Third Closing Date shall only be permitted by this clause (xx) to the extent that the
terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous in any material
respect in the good faith judgment of Topco to the Class B Lenders when taken as a whole; and

(xx) (i) the Transactions, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of Topco or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and any payments
pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Third Closing
Date or described in “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” in this Offering Circular, as
these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced
or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not
more disadvantageous to the Class B2 Noteholders in any material respect, and (iii) the entry into and
performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement.

**Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Certain Financial Indebtedness**

Topco will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to Guarantee
the payment of any Class A Loans, Additional Class A Loans or Financial Indebtedness Incurred under the Credit Facility (or,
in each case, any Refinancing Financial Indebtedness Incurred in respect thereof) unless such Restricted Subsidiary
simultaneously executes and delivers an accession agreement to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement providing for
the Guarantee of the payment of the Class B2 Loan and Class B2 Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Guarantee will
be pari passu with or junior to such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such Class A Loans, Additional Class A Loans or
Financial Indebtedness Incurred under the Credit Facility (or, in each case, any Refinancing Financial Indebtedness Incurred
in respect thereof).

Each such additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognise certain defences generally available to
guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of creditors generally) or
other considerations under applicable law.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to any Guarantees of any Restricted Subsidiary:

(i) existing on the Third Closing Date; or

(ii) given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less
than £250.0 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such Guarantee was given, of at least “A” or the
equivalent thereof by S&P and Fitch, in connection with the operation of cash management programmes
established for the benefit of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

257


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Topco shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee the
payment of the Class B2 Loan or Class B2 Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would
reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in:

(i) a violation of applicable law which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through
measures reasonably available to Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary; or

(ii) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary.

**Reports**

For so long as any Class B2 Loan is outstanding, Topco will provide to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Class
B Note Trustee (for the benefit of the Class B2 Noteholders) the following reports:

(i) within 120 days after the end of Intermediate Holdco’s financial year, annual reports containing the
following information: (A) audited consolidated balance sheets of Intermediate Holdco as of the end of
the two most recent financial years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash
flow of Topco for the two most recent financial years, including complete footnotes to such financial
statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (B) pro forma income
information and balance sheet information of Intermediate Holdco (which, for the avoidance of doubt
shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably
available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions or dispositions that represent
greater than 20% of the consolidated revenues, EBITDA, or assets of Intermediate Holdco or
recapitalisations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed financial year as to
which such annual report relates; (C) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements,
including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources
of Intermediate Holdco, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical
accounting policies and (D) a description of material risk factors and material recent developments of the
Group.

(ii) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three financial quarters in each financial year of
Intermediate Holdco, all quarterly reports of Intermediate Holdco containing the following information:
(A) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of such quarter and unaudited condensed
statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter and year-to-date period ending on the
unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods, together with condensed
footnote disclosure; (B) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of Intermediate
Holdco (which, for the avoidance of doubt shall not include the provision of a full income statement or
balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions or dispositions that represents greater than 20% of the consolidated revenues, EBITDA or
assets of Intermediate Holdco or recapitalisations that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant
quarter, in each case unless pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to
clauses (i) and (iii) or this clause (ii); (C) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations and financial condition, EBITDA, and
material changes in liquidity and capital resources of Intermediate Holdco; and (D) material recent
developments of Intermediate Holdco;

(iii) within ten days after the occurrence of (A) a material acquisition, disposition or restructuring; (B) any
senior management change at Topco; (C) any change in the auditors of Intermediate Holdco; (D) the
entering into an agreement that would result in a Class B2 Change of Control; or (E) any material events
that any Obligor announces publicly, in each case, a report containing a description of such events; and

(iv) on each Semi-Annual Investor Reporting Date, CP Opco must provide details of a telephone conference
into which the Class A Noteholders and Class B2 Noteholders may dial, on which the senior management
of the Obligors must present their financial results for the relevant period, provided that CP Opco shall
only be required to hold telephone conferences if so required under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement,

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above will not be required to (A) contain any_
reconciliation to U.S. GAAP or (B) include separate financial statements for any Obligors or any Subsidiaries of Intermediate
Holdco that are not Obligors.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that material differences exist between the results of operations or
financial condition of Topco and Intermediate Holdco, the annual and quarterly reports shall give a reasonably detailed
description of such differences. Topco may at any time elect to become the reporting entity in place of Intermediate Holdco,
after which election, references to the “Intermediate Holdco” in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) and the proviso above shall be
deemed to refer to Topco.

258


-----

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS. Except as provided for above, no report need
include separate financial statements for the Obligors or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other
financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Circular.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Borrower Security Trustee of the reports specified in clause (i),
(ii) and (iii) above, Topco shall make available copies of all reports required on its website.

For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Class B Note Trustee nor the Borrower Security Trustee shall be responsible
for monitoring or confirming the validity or accuracy of the reports or information delivered pursuant to this covenant or
compliance by Topco with its obligations under this covenant.

In addition, Topco shall furnish to the Class B2 Noteholders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Class
B2 Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities Act.

**Conduct of Business/Business Activities**

The Obligors will not engage in any business other than a Class B2 Permitted Business, except to the extent as
would not be material to the Obligors, taken as a whole.

**Limitation on Holding Company Activities**

Topco and Holdco must not carry on any business or own any assets other than:

(i) (a) with respect to Topco, the ownership of Capital Stock of Holdco and (b) with respect to Holdco, the
ownership of Intermediate Holdco;

(ii) conduct of their business as holding companies, including the provision of administrative services
(excluding treasury services but including the on-lending of monies to their respective Restricted
Subsidiaries) and management services to its Subsidiaries of a type customarily provided by a holding
company to its Subsidiaries and the ownership of assets necessary to provide such services;

(iii) activities undertaken with the purpose of fulfilling rights and obligations arising under the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party, asset and liabilities under the Transaction Documents, and professional
fees and administration costs in connection therewith and otherwise in the ordinary course of business as a
holding company;

(iv) credit balances in bank accounts and Investments in cash and Cash Equivalents;

(v) subject to the provisions described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, Incurring Financial
Indebtedness as described in “— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Financial Indebtedness” (including
activities reasonably incidental thereto, including performance of the terms and conditions of such
Financial Indebtedness, to the extent such activities are otherwise permissible under the Class B Issuer/
Borrower Loan Agreement) and the granting of Liens as described in “— Certain Covenants —
_Limitations on Liens”;_

(vi) making Investments in the Class B2 Notes or Financial Indebtedness as described in “— Certain
_Covenants — Limitation on Financial Indebtedness”;_

(vii) directly related or reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of its or its Subsidiaries’
corporate existence or for the purpose of transferring such property and assets to any Parent or other
Person;

(viii) activities pursuant to or in connection with the Transactions; or

(ix) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are de minimis in nature or ancillary to or related to
those listed in this covenant.

Neither Topco nor Holdco will, directly or indirectly, Incur any Financial Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness, but excluding any outstanding intercompany Financial Indebtedness existing on the Third Closing Date) other
than (i) the Incurrence of obligations or liabilities arising by operation of law, (ii) the Incurrence of liabilities to pay Taxes and
paying Taxes, (iii) the Incurrence such as may arise of liabilities under the Topco Payment Undertaking of the Topco

-----

Neither Topco nor Holdco will, directly or indirectly, create, Incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or
become effective any Lien of any kind securing Financial Indebtedness upon any of its property or assets, now owned or
hereinafter acquired, except to secure any Permitted Topco Lien.

Neither Topco nor Holdco will not take, or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which action or
omission would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the collateral granted under the
relevant Topco Security Documents (it being understood that the Incurrence of Liens on the Topco Security permitted by the
definition of Permitted Topco Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with
respect to the Topco Security) for the benefit of the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer, and neither Topco nor Holdco
will grant to any Person other than the Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the Issuer and the other beneficiaries
described in the Topco Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any
interest whatsoever in the Topco Security; provided that (a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge or release of
the Topco Security in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Topco Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) Topco and Holdco may Incur Permitted Topco
Liens; provided further, however, that, subject to the foregoing, Topco Security Documents may not be amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced, or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of
at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) unless Topco or Holdco, as applicable, contemporaneously with such
amendment, extension, replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, renewal or release (followed by an immediate
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the assets), delivers to the Borrower Security Trustee (i) a certificate
from the Board of Directors or chief financial officer of the relevant Person (acting in good faith) that confirms the solvency
of the Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, replacement, supplement, modification or release, or (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification,
replacement or release and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the Topco Payment Undertaking created under the Topco
Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced or released and retaken are
valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law,
that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking.

**Impairment of Security Interest**

Topco will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or negligently
omit to take, any action which action or omission would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with
respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of
Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to
the Collateral) for the benefit of the Borrower Security Trustee and the holders of the Class B2 Notes, and Topco will not, and
will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than the Borrower Security Trustee, for
the benefit of the Borrower Security Trustee and the Class B2 Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Borrower
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in
any of the Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in
accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Borrower Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted
Collateral Liens; provided further, however, that, subject to the foregoing, no Borrower Security Document may be amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced, or released (followed by an immediate retaking of
a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) unless Topco contemporaneously with such amendment, extension,
replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, renewal or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the assets), delivers to the Borrower Security Trustee (i) a certificate from the Board of Directors
or chief financial officer of the relevant Person (acting in good faith) that confirms the solvency of the Person granting such
Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, replacement,
supplement, modification or release, or (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Borrower Security Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release
and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the Class B2 Loan created under the Borrower Security Documents so amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced or released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not
otherwise subject to any limitation imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not
otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification,
replacement or release and retaking.

At the direction of Topco and without the consent of the holders of the Class B2 Notes, the Borrower Security
Trustee may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Borrower Security Documents to:

(i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein;

(ii) subject to compliance with the provisions described in the first paragraph of this covenant, provide for
Permitted Collateral Liens;

260


-----

(iii) add to the Collateral; or

(iv) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Class B2
Notes in any material respect.

In the event that Topco complies with the provisions described in “— Impairment of Security Interest”, the
Borrower Security Trustee shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release with no need for instructions from the
holders of Class B2 Notes.

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

At the request of Topco, in connection with the Incurrence or refinancing by Topco or its Restricted Subsidiaries of
any Financial Indebtedness secured or permitted to be secured on the Collateral, Topco, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries
and the Borrower Security Trustee shall enter into an intercreditor or similar agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor
**Agreement”) with the creditors of such Financial Indebtedness (or their duly authorised representatives) on substantially the**
same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or on terms not materially less favourable to the holders of the Class B2 Notes),
including containing substantially the same terms with respect to the application of the proceeds of the collateral held
thereunder and the means of enforcement; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any
personal obligations on the Borrower Security Trustee or, in the opinion of the Borrower Security Trustee, adversely affect the
rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Borrower Security Trustee under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement
or the Intercreditor Agreement. As used herein, the term Intercreditor Agreement shall include references to any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement that supplements or replaces the Intercreditor Agreement.

At the written direction of Topco and without the consent of the holders of the Class B2 Notes, the Borrower
Security Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to:

(i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement;

(ii) increase the amount or types of Financial Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be
Incurred by Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries that are subject to any such agreement (provided that
such Financial Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement)
(including the addition of provisions relating to new Financial Indebtedness ranking junior or pari passu in
right of payment with the Class B2 Loan and the Class B2 Notes);

(iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iv) further secure the Class B2 Loan (including Additional Class B Loan) in accordance with the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(v) make provision for equal and rateable pledges of the Collateral to secure Class B Additional Notes and
Additional Class B Loan or to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens;

(vi) grant any Additional Class B Facility or amend any existing Class B2 Facility to provide for further
advances; and/or

(vii) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of the Class B2
Notes in any material respect. Topco shall not otherwise direct the Borrower Security Trustee to enter into
any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Class B2 Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted as described in
“— Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and Topco
may only direct the Borrower Security Trustee to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment
does not impose any personal obligations on the Borrower Security Trustee or, in the opinion of the
Borrower Security Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Borrower
Security Trustee under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement relating to the Class B2 Loan, the
Class B2 Notes or any Intercreditor Agreement.

Each holder of Class B2 Notes, by accepting a Class B2 Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the
terms and conditions of any Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the
provisions described herein).

**SHARE ENFORCEMENT EVENT AND CLASS B LOAN EVENT OF DEFAULT**

**Share Enforcement Event**

For so long as any Class A Loans or Additional Class A Loans are outstanding, each of the following is a “Share
**Enforcement Event” under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement:**

(i) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Class B Loan when due and
payable, continued for 30 days;

(ii) if any amount (including, without limitation, any principal amount or premium of a Class B Loan)
remains outstanding (whether or not then due and payable) under a Class B Loan as at close of business
on the Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date of such Class B Loan;

(iii) failure to pay the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Class B Loan upon optional redemption,
upon required repurchase or upon declaration;

(iv) failure by Topco to comply with the provisions described in “— Certain Covenants — Limitation on
_Holding Company Activities”;_

(v) failure to comply for 30 days after written notice by the Borrower Security Trustee on behalf of the
holders of the Class B Notes or by the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Class
B Notes with Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ obligations described in “— Class B2 Change of
_Control” (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Class B2 Notes which will constitute a Share_
Enforcement Event under clause (ii) above);

(vi) failure to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Borrower Security Trustee on behalf of the
holders of the Class B Notes or by the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Class
B Notes with Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ other agreements contained in the Class B Issuer/
Borrower Loan Agreement, subject to the cure rights described in “— Certain Covenants — Class B
_Financial Covenant — Cure right”;_

(vii) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Financial Indebtedness for money borrowed by Topco or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by Topco or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries) other than Financial Indebtedness owed to Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such
Financial Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(A) is caused by a failure to pay principal on such Financial Indebtedness, immediately upon the
expiration of the grace period provided in such Financial Indebtedness (“Payment Default”); or

(B) results in the acceleration of such Financial Indebtedness prior to its maturity (“Cross**Acceleration”),**

and, in each case, (I) the aggregate principal amount of any such Financial Indebtedness, together
with the principal amount of any other such Financial Indebtedness under which there has been a
payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, equals £10.0 million or more
and (II) other than a Payment Default with respect to Financial Indebtedness Incurred under the
Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or under any Credit Facility;

(viii) Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries
that taken as a whole constitutes a Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of Bankruptcy
Law:

(A) commences a voluntary case;

(B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case;

(C) consents to the appointment of a custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property; or

(D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;

(ix) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:

(A) is for relief against Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole constitutes a Significant Subsidiary in an
involuntary case;

262


-----

(B) appoints a custodian of Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or
any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole constitutes a Significant Subsidiary or
for all or substantially all of the property of Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary; or

(C) orders the liquidation of Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or
any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole constitutes a Significant Subsidiary,

and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days;

(x) failure by Topco or any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a
whole constitutes a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of
the latest audited consolidated financial statements for Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole
constitutes a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of £10.0 million
(exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which
judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final;

(xi) any security interest under the Borrower Security Documents on any material Collateral shall, at any time,
cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Borrower
Security Document and the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or the release or
amendment of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement or such Borrower Security Document or any such security interest created thereunder
shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or Topco shall assert in writing that any such security interest is
invalid or unenforceable and any such Class B Loan Default continues for ten days;

(xii) any Class B Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or Topco or a Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its
Class B Guarantee, other than in accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of the Class B
Guarantee in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement; and

(xiii) a Class B Note Event of Default (not giving effect, for these purposes, to the provisions of Condition 11.2
of the Class B2 Conditions) or a Class B Trigger Event has occurred (subject to any relevant grace period
or cure rights).

However, a default under any of the provisions described under clauses (v), (vi), (vii) or (x) above will not
constitute a Share Enforcement Event until the Borrower Security Trustee or the holders of 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Class B Notes notify Topco of the default and, with respect to clauses (v), (vi), (vii) and (x), Topco does not cure
such default within the time specified in clauses (v), (vi), (vii) or (x), as applicable, after receipt of such notice.

If a Share Enforcement Event occurs and is continuing, the Borrower Security Trustee acting upon the instructions
of the Issuer Security Trustee as directed by the Class B Note Trustee, who shall be required to act if directed by the holders
of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Class B Notes, may by notice to Topco enforce the Topco Payment
Undertaking and Topco Security Documents in accordance with their terms and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Class B Loan Event of Default**

If at any time either (i) no amounts remain outstanding under any Class A Loans or Additional Class A Loans or
(ii) an acceleration of the amounts that remain outstanding under any Class A Loans has occurred, each of the Share
Enforcement Events set out in “— Share Enforcement Event” above will also constitute a “Class B Loan Event of Default”.

In addition, whether or not any amounts remain outstanding under any Class A Loans or Additional Class A Loans,
any default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Class B2 Loan borrowed under the Class B
Issuer/ Borrower Loan Agreement when due on the Class B2 Loan Final Maturity Date shall be a Class B Loan Event of
Default.

If a Class B Loan Event of Default (other than a Class B Loan Event of Default described in clauses (viii) or (ix) of
the first paragraph of “— Share Enforcement Event”, above) occurs and is continuing, the Borrower Security Trustee by
notice to Topco on the instruction of the Issuer Security Trustee (who acts on the instructions of the Class B Note Trustee, as
directed by the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Class B Notes) in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement, may declare the principal or premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, on all the Class B2 Loan to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately.

263


-----

If a Class B Loan Event of Default described in clauses (viii) or (ix) of the first paragraph of “— Share Enforcement
_Event” above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional_
Amounts, if any, on the Class B2 Loan will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act
on the part of the Borrower Security Trustee or any holders of Class B Notes.

No Class B Loan Event of Default may occur with respect to the Class B2 Loan while any amounts remain
outstanding under any of the Class A Loans (until after an acceleration of the Class A Loans) although this is without
prejudice to the ability of the Borrower Security Trustee, at the direction of the Class B Noteholders, to enforce the security
granted pursuant to the Topco Security Documents in certain circumstances including, without limitation, where there has
been a failure to pay cash interest on the Class B2 Loan prior to the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date or a failure to
repay principal, Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon on such date. Where
there is such a failure to pay and for so long as the Class B2 Loan remains outstanding thereafter (whether or not security is
being enforced), any overdue amount of principal or interest and the Class B2 Loan will bear interest at the interest rates set
out in the second and third paragraphs under “— Interest — Payment of interest” above.

**AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS**

**Procedure**

Any term of the Class B Finance Documents may be amended or waived with the agreement of the Borrowers, the
Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Each Guarantor agrees to (and authorises any Borrower to execute on its behalf) any amendment or waiver allowed
by this covenant which is agreed to by the Borrowers. This includes any amendment or waiver which would, but for this
paragraph, require the consent of each Guarantor if the Class B Guarantee under the Class B Finance Documents is to remain
in full force and effect.

**POST-CLOSING REORGANISATIONS**

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement also provides that a number of post-closing transactions will be
permitted (subject to certain conditions being satisfied), including:

**Longleat Headlease Transfer and grant of the New Longleat Opco Lease**

If CP Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that it intends to arrange the transfer either directly
or indirectly by means of a surrender and re-grant of the Longleat Headlease Interest from Longleat Propco to a new propertyholding Obligor (a “Longleat Headlease Transfer”) and the grant of the Opco Lease between that new Obligor and “CP
Opco (the New Longleat Opco Lease”) in each case with the consent of the landlord, then provided that CP Opco certifies
that the provisions relating thereto in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with, the Borrower Security Trustee must, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice but subject to the second paragraph of this covenant, at the cost
of the Borrowers, sign and execute all such documents, instruments and consents (including Land Registry forms) as are
necessary or desirable in order to enable the transfer of the Longleat Headlease Interest and the grant of the New Longleat
Opco Lease as aforesaid.

In connection with the Longleat Headlease Transfer and the New Longleat Opco Lease, such new Obligor must:

(i) execute and deliver in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the Borrower Secured
Creditors a Longleat Legal Charge; and

(ii) provide the Borrower Security Trustee with a legal opinion (in a form satisfactory to the Borrower
Security Trustee) on the enforceability of the Longleat Legal Charge,

in each case, at the same time as any relevant release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee, and provide,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of the Longleat Headlease Transfer, the Borrower Security Trustee with
a new certificate of title in industry standard form evidencing that that new Obligor is entitled to be registered as the registered
proprietor of the Longleat Headlease Interest and CP Opco is entitled to be registered as the registered proprietor of the New
Longleat Opco Lease, and the Borrower Security Trustee is entitled (but not obliged) to be registered as the proprietor of the
Longleat Legal Charge.

In connection with the grant of the New Longleat Opco Lease, CP Opco must execute and deliver in favour of the
Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the Borrower Secured Creditors a charge by way of legal mortgage in respect of
the New Longleat Opco Lease substantially in the form set out in the Borrower Deed of Charge at the same time as any
relevant release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee.

264


-----

**Release of Designated Obligors**

If:

(i) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the Obligor Group intends to wind
up and ultimately dissolve some or all of the Designated Obligors; and

(ii) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the provisions relating thereto as
set out in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with,

then the Borrower Security Trustee must as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice, at the cost of the
Borrowers:

(A) release:

(I) all Liens granted by the relevant Designated Obligors under the Borrower Security Documents;
and

(II) all Liens granted in respect of any share capital of the relevant Designated Obligors under the
Borrower Security Documents; and

(B) irrevocably release and discharge the relevant Designated Obligors from all liabilities which they may
have under the Class B Finance Documents.

The above provisions may be utilised on more than one occasion in connection with different Designated Obligors.

**Capital reductions**

If CP Opco (on behalf of the Obligors) notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee in writing (and with
reasonable detail as to what is proposed) that an Obligor proposes to undertake any capital reduction procedures then, subject
to (b), (c) and (d) below, the Borrower Security Trustee must sign and/or execute such documents or instruments and give
such consents (if any) as are or may be necessary or desirable in the opinion of CP Opco (acting reasonably) in order to
implement the relevant capital reduction.

Any costs of the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee in respect of any such capital reduction must be met by
the Obligors.

CP Opco must first provide the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee with appropriate evidence (which may be,
if required in writing by the Borrower Security Trustee, an opinion issued by the professional tax advisor of the Group)
satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee (acting reasonably) that the proposed capital reduction will not give rise to any
adverse tax liability in the Obligors or the Issuer, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Tax Deed of Covenant.

The provisions of this covenant are without prejudice to the provisions of “— Certain Covenants — Class B2
Restricted Payments”.

**Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisations**

If CP Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that, without prejudice to the Group’s obligations
under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Obligor Group intends to enter into a transaction, or a series of
transactions, in connection with a sale of a Propco or a Propco’s interest in a Holiday Park (such transaction or series of
transactions, a “Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisation”) in each case with landlord consent (where such consent is required),
then the Borrower Security Trustee must as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice, at the cost of the
Borrowers, provide all necessary consents, waivers and permissions (including any release and simultaneous re-taking of
security which may be required) which are necessary to enable such Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisation to take place, but only
to the extent that:

(i) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the provisions relating thereto as
set out in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with; and

(ii) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that any such release is not reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the position of the Borrower Secured Creditors.

The above provisions may be utilised on more than one occasion in connection with different Permitted Pre-Sale
Reorganisations.

265


-----

**Permitted Post-Closing Reorganisations**

If CP Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that, without prejudice to the Group’s obligations
under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Group intends to enter into a transaction, or a series of transactions,
as part of the reorganisation of the Group as envisaged in Section 14 of the Permitted Post-Closing Reorganisation Paper (a
“Permitted Post-Closing Reorganisation”), then the Borrower Security Trustee must as soon as reasonably practicable after
the receipt of such notice, at the cost of the Borrowers, provide all necessary consents, waivers and permissions (including any
release and simultaneous re-taking of security which may be required) which are necessary to enable the Permitted PostClosing Reorganisations to take place, but only to the extent that:

(i) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the provisions relating thereto as
set out in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with; and

(ii) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that any such release is not reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the position of the Borrower Secured Creditors.

The above provisions may be utilised on more than one occasion in connection with different Permitted
Post-Closing Reorganisations.

**Woburn Headlease Transfer and grant of the Woburn Opco Lease**

If CP Woburn Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that it intends to arrange the assignment
of the Woburn Headlease from CP Woburn Opco to a new property-holding Obligor (a “Woburn Headlease Transfer”) and/
or the grant of an Opco Lease between that new Obligor or CP Woburn Opco, as the case may be, and CP Opco (the
“Woburn Opco Lease”) in each case with the consent of the landlord, then provided that CP Woburn Opco certifies that the
provisions relating thereto in the First Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with, the Borrower Security Trustee
must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice but subject to the paragraph below, at the cost of the
Borrowers, sign and execute all such documents, instruments and consents (including Land Registry forms) as are necessary
or desirable in order to enable the transfer of the Woburn Headlease and/or the grant of the Woburn Opco Lease as aforesaid.
In connection with the Woburn Headlease Transfer and/or the Woburn Opco Lease, such new Obligor must:

(i) execute and deliver in favour of the (i) Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the Borrower Secured
Creditors a mortgage over the relevant Property; and

(ii) provide the Borrower Security Trustee with a legal opinion (in a form satisfactory to the Borrower
Security Trustee) on the enforceability of that mortgage,

in each case, at the same time as any relevant release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee, and provide,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of the Woburn Headlease Transfer, the Borrower Security Trustee with
a new certificate of title in industry standard form evidencing that that new Obligor is entitled to be registered as the registered
proprietor of the Woburn Headlease and CP Opco is entitled to be registered as the registered proprietor of the Woburn Opco
Lease, and the Borrower Security Trustee is entitled (but not obliged) to be registered as the proprietor of the Woburn Legal
Charge.

In connection with the grant of the Woburn Opco Lease, CP Opco must execute and deliver in favour of the
Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the Borrower Secured Creditors a charge by way of legal mortgage in respect of
the Woburn Opco Lease substantially in the form set out in the Borrower Deed of Charge at the same time as any relevant
release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee.

**ADDITIONAL SITE COVENANTS**

**Costs and payments**

Notwithstanding anything in “— Certain Covenants — Class B2 Restricted Payments” to the contrary, any Obligor
may, in connection with any Additional Site, incur Relevant Costs (on behalf of an Additional Site Entity) provided that:

(i) the Net Exposure Amount does not at any time exceed £1.0 million; and

(ii) the Long Term Net Exposure Amount does not at any time exceed £5.0 million, each such amount to be
indexed, upwards only, at the end of each financial year based on the CPI applicable to that Financial
Year.

266


-----

For the purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant:

“Long Term Net Exposure Amount” means, at any time:

(i) the aggregate of Relevant Costs (x) which have been incurred and paid by the Obligors under the first
paragraph of this covenant which have been funded otherwise than by utilisation of funds which at the

Holding S.à r.l. (as applicable), it shall promptly execute and deliver to the Borrower Security Trustee an Accession Deed
(together with any supporting documentation referred to in that Accession Deed) and, upon such execution and delivery, such
person shall be bound by the provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement as if the terms set out in the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement were incorporated in full into the arrangements made between that person and the Borrower
Secured Creditors.

In the event that the accession of any person to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement requires the Borrower
Security Trustee, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Cash Manager, the Borrower Account Bank, the Issuer Account Bank or the
Principal Paying Agent to comply with “know your customer” or other similar identification procedures and in such
circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Obligor Group Agent shall promptly upon the
request of the Borrower Security Trustee supply, or procure the supply of, such documentation and other evidence as is
reasonably requested by the Borrower Security Trustee in order for it to carry out and be satisfied that it has complied with all
the necessary “know your customer” or similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to any relevant
person pursuant to the accession of such person to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement as an Additional Obligor or
Additional Non-Obligor Group Entity and such person shall not become an Additional Obligor or Additional Non-Obligor
Group Entity until the Borrower Security Trustee has completed its “know your customer” or similar checks.

Each party acknowledges that such Accession Deed shall, if so requested by the Borrower Security Trustee or the
Issuer, be accompanied by: (i) legal tax and accounting opinions, addressed to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer,
and in a form satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee; (ii) any documentation required to accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement and/or the Borrower Deed of Charge (if relevant); and (iii) a certificate signed by the Borrowers confirming that
no Share Enforcement Event, Class B Loan Default or Class B Loan Event of Default is outstanding.

Such Obligor shall accede to the Tax Deed of Covenant in accordance with clause 2.8 of the Tax Deed of Covenant
and to the First Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant in accordance with Clause 8 of the First Supplemental Tax Deed of
Covenant and to the Second Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant in accordance with Clause 7 of the Second Supplemental
Tax Deed of Covenant.

Any Borrower may request that a non-Material Obligor ceases to be an Obligor under the terms of the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement by giving to the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee a duly completed Obligor
Resignation Request.

267


-----

The Borrower Security Trustee must accept an Obligor Resignation Request (in substantially the same form as
provided in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) and notify the Borrowers and the Issuer of its acceptance if the
conditions referred to in the Obligor Resignation Request are satisfied. The relevant Obligor will cease to be an Obligor when
the Borrower Security Trustee gives the notification.

**CLASS A DISCHARGE DATE**

The Obligors will not permit the Class A Discharge Date to occur unless the Issuer has received a Rating Agency
Confirmation in respect of the Class B2 Notes from S&P with respect thereto.

**CLASS A COVENANTS**

From the date on which a Share Enforcement Event also constitutes a Class B Loan Event of Default, the general
and property covenants set out in the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (the “Class A Covenants”) shall be deemed
to be incorporated into the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement mutatis mutandis as further described below, until such
time as the Issuer receives a Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P in relation to the disapplication of the Class A
Covenants.

Where the Class A Covenants are incorporated into the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement as described
above:

(a) capitalised terms used in the Class A Covenants shall have the same meaning and construction as
incorporated into the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, subject to paragraphs (b) to (e) below;

(b) references to “Class A Loans”, “Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement”, “Class A IBLA” and “Class
A Notes” shall be deemed to be references to “Class B Loans”, “Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement”, “Class B IBLA” and “Class B Notes”, respectively;

(c) references to a “Class A Loan Event of Default” and “Class A Loan Potential Event of Default” shall be
deemed to be references to a “Class B Loan Event of Default” and a “Class B Loan Default” respectively;

(d) where a Class A Covenant (or a defined term referred to in a Class A Covenant) refers to both “Class A”
and “Class B”, the references to “Class B” shall be deemed to be deleted and the references to “Class A”
shall be deemed to be references to “Class B”;

(e) the Borrower Security Trustee shall have the power to enforce the Class A Covenants on behalf of the
Issuer and (indirectly) the Class B Noteholders as if the Class B Loan constituted a Class A Loan on the
terms of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement may be amended by the parties thereto in accordance with the
Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement from time to time without the consent of the Class
B Noteholders. To the extent any Class A Covenants are amended following the Exchangeable Note Issue Date, the Class A
Covenants incorporated into the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in the manner described above, shall be the
Class A Covenants as amended, restated or supplemented on the date of such incorporation into the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement.

If the Class A Covenants are amended following the Exchangeable Note Issue Date, the CP Opco shall notify the
Issuer and the Class B Note Trustee of such amendments, and the Issuer shall give notice to the Class B Noteholders in the
manner set out in the Class B Conditions.

**RELEASE OF LIENS**

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, liens on the Collateral securing the obligations under the Class B Finance
Documents (or if other Borrower Secured Liabilities remain outstanding, all claims of the Issuer in respect of those Liens to
the extent of its claims under the Class B Finance Documents) will be automatically and unconditionally released:

(a) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on each Class B Loan under the Class
B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or discharge thereof;

(b) upon release of a Guarantee in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (with
respect to the Liens securing the assets, property and Capital Stock of the Guarantor that is released from
such Guarantee);

268


-----

(c) in connection with any disposition of Collateral to any Person other than Topco or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (but excluding any transaction subject to the provisions described under “— Certain
_Covenants — Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” that is permitted by the Class B Issuer/Borrower_
Loan Agreement (with respect to the Liens on such Collateral));

(d) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property or
assets to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) Topco or any
Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition that is not prohibited by, or does not otherwise
violate the provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement relating to asset sales;

(e) if Topco designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(f) as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(g) otherwise permitted under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

The Borrower Security Trustee will, subject to its receipt of an Officer’s certificate or opinion of counsel or other
documentation reasonably requested, take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the
obligations under the Class B Finance Documents in accordance with the provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Borrower Security
Documents. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Borrower Security Trustee without the consent of the
Issuer.

**DEFEASANCE**

The Borrowers may at any time terminate all obligations of the Borrowers and the Guarantors under the Class B2
Loans and the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Share Enforcement
Events and Class B Loan Event of Defaults, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the
rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Borrower Security Trustee and the obligations of the
Borrowers in connection therewith. Subject to the foregoing, if the Borrowers exercise their legal defeasance option, the Class
B Finance Document and the rights of the Borrower Security Trustee and the Class B2 Noteholders under the Intercreditor
Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust) in so far as they apply to the
Class B2 Loan, the Class B2 Notes and the Class B2 Noteholders.

The Borrowers at any time may terminate their and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described under
“Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (i) and (ii) of the first paragraph of “— Certain Covenants — Merger, Consolidation
_or Sale of Assets”) and “Change B2 Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under_
“Share Enforcement Event And Class B Loan Event Of Default”, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default,
the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Borrowers and Significant Subsidiaries, the
judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “Share Enforcement
_Event” (“covenant defeasance”)._

The Borrowers at their option at any time may exercise their legal defeasance option notwithstanding their prior
exercise of the covenant defeasance option. If the Borrowers exercises their legal defeasance option, payment of the Class B2
Loans may not be accelerated because of a Share Enforcement Event or Class B Loan Event of Default with respect to such
Class B2 Loans and the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event would not give the right to enforce the Topco Payment
Undertakings and Topco Security. If the Borrowers exercise their covenant defeasance option with respect to the Class B2
Loans, payment of the Class B2 Loans may not be accelerated because of a Share Enforcement Event specified in clauses
(vi) (other than with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “— Certain
_Covenants — Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”), (vii), (viii) (with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (x),_
(xi) or (xii) under the first paragraph of “Share Enforcement Event And Class B Loan Event Of Default”.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Borrowers must irrevocably deposit in trust by way of security (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Borrower Security Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Borrower
Security Trustee for this purpose) cash in Sterling in an amount sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and
interest, Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amounts and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon on the Class B2 Loans to
maturity and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Borrower Security Trustee of:

(1) an opinion of U.S. counsel to the effect that the lenders of the relevant Class B2 Loans will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and
will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of
legal defeasance only, such opinion of U.S. counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

269


-----

(2) an Officer’s Certificate of each Borrower stating that the deposit was not made by the Borrowers with the
intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Borrowers;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate of each Borrower and an opinion of counsel (which opinion of counsel may be
subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for
or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an opinion of U.S. counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5) all other documents or other information that the Borrower Security Trustee may reasonably require in
connection with either defeasance option.

**SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE**

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, and the rights of the Borrower Security Trustee, the Issuer and the
Class B2 Noteholders under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Borrower Security Documents, will be discharged and cease
to be of further effect as to all outstanding Class B2 Loans when (1) (i) all of the Class B2 Loans have become due and
payable or (ii) all of the Class B2 Loans will become due and payable at the Class B2 Loan Expected Maturity Date or the
Class B2 Loan Final Maturity Date, in each case within one year or (iii) all of the Class B2 Loans are to be called for
prepayment within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee for the giving of
notice of prepayment by the Borrowers; (2) the Borrowers have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Borrower
Security Trustee (or another entity designated by the Borrower Security Trustee for this purpose), an amount in Sterling
sufficient to pay and discharge the entire outstanding principal amount on the Class B2 Loans, together with any prepayment
premium, if any, accrued and unpaid interest, Class B2 Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid
interest thereon, to the date of deposit (in the case of Class B2 Loans that have become due and payable), or to the Class B2
Loan Final Maturity Date or prepayment date, as the case may be; (3) the Borrowers have paid or caused to be paid all other
sums payable under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement with respect to the Class B2 Loans; (4) the Borrowers have
delivered an irrevocable notice of prepayment to the Borrower Security Trustee and have delivered irrevocable instructions to
apply the funds deposited towards the payment of the Class B2 Loans on the prepayment date; and (5) the Borrowers have
delivered to the Borrower Security Trustee an Officer’s Certificate of each Borrower (which the Borrower Security Trustee
may rely on without further inquiry) to the effect that all conditions precedent under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Class B2 Loans have been complied with.

**NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of Topco or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Topco, Issuer or any Guarantor under the Class B Finance
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Class B2
Noteholders by accepting a Class B2 Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Class B2 Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**GOVERNING LAW**

Subsidiary on the Fixed Charge Coverage Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any
time during such four-quarter period.

For the purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of Topco (including synergies
and cost savings). If any Financial Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the
interest on such Financial Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to
such Financial Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalised Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate
reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of Topco to be the rate of interest implicit in such
Capitalised Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. For the purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest
on any Financial Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed with a pro forma basis shall be computed based
upon the average daily balance of such Financial Indebtedness during the applicable period, except as set forth in the first
paragraph of this definition. Interest on Financial Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based
upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been
based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as Topco may designate.

(a) (i) any Subsidiary of Topco that at the time of determination is an Unrestricted Subsidiary (as designated
by the Board of Directors of Topco in the manner provided below); and (ii) any Subsidiary of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary; and

(b) notwithstanding the foregoing, any entity listed under Schedule 9 (List of Unrestricted Subsidiaries) of the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

The Board of Directors of Topco may designate any Subsidiary of Topco (including any newly acquired or newly
formed Subsidiary or a Person becoming a Subsidiary through merger, consolidation or other business combination
transaction, or Investment therein) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary only if:

(i) such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries does not own any Capital Stock or Financial Indebtedness of, or
own or hold any Lien on any property of, Topco or any other Subsidiary of Topco which is not a
Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so designated or otherwise an Unrestricted Subsidiary; and

(ii) such designation and the Investment of Topco in such Subsidiary complies with “Certain Covenants —
_Class B2 Restricted Payments”._

If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all
outstanding Investments owned by Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for
Restricted Payments under the covenant described in “Certain Covenants — Class B2 Restricted Payments” or under one or
more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by Topco. That designation will only be permitted if
the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary.

Any such designation by the Board of Directors of Topco shall be evidenced to the Borrower Security Trustee by
filing with the Borrower Security Trustee a resolution of the Board of Directors of Topco giving effect to such designation
and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the foregoing conditions.

If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will
thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for the purposes of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and any
Financial Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred as of such date and, if such Financial Indebtedness is
not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under “Certain Covenants — Limitation on Financial Indebtedness”, Topco will
be in default of such covenant.

The Board of Directors of Topco may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided
that immediately after giving effect to such designation (1) no Default, Share Enforcement Event or Class B Loan Event of
Default would result therefrom and (2) (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be greater than 2.0 to 1.0 or (y) the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio would not be worse than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such designation, in each case,
on a pro forma basis taking into account such designation. Any such designation by the Board of Directors shall be evidenced
to the Borrower Security Trustee by promptly filing with the Borrower Security Trustee a copy of the resolution of the Board
of Directors giving effect to such designation or an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the
foregoing provisions.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Offered Notes sold to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A will be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Note”). The Offered Notes sold to persons who are
not U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S will be represented by a global note in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the
“Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited on the Exchangeable Note Issue or the Third Closing Date, as
applicable, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the account of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A BookEntry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
or persons that hold interests through such participants.

Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their respective participants through
customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited
circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive certificated form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained in
book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states
of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive
certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In
addition, while the Offered Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or
“holders” of Offered Notes for any purpose.

By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Note, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to
represent, among other things, that it is not a U.S. person, that it is located outside the United States and that, if it determines
to transfer such beneficial interest prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period (as such terms are defined in
Rules 902 and 903 of Regulation S), deemed to include the 40-day period after the commencement of the offering of the
Exchangeable Notes or the Exchangeable Note Issue Date, which ever is later (the “distribution compliance period”), it will
transfer such interest only (a) to a person who is not a U.S. person in an offshore transaction in accordance with Rule 903 or
Rule 904 of Regulation S or (b) in accordance with Rule 144A to a person that it and any person acting on its behalf
reasonably believe is a QIB purchasing for its own account or the account of a QIB, in each case in accordance with any
applicable securities laws of any state of the United States. See “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions”.

By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Note, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to
represent, among other things, that it is a QIB purchasing for its own account or the account of a QIB and that, if in the future
it determines to transfer such beneficial interest, it will transfer such interest in accordance with the procedures and
restrictions contained in the Trust Deeds. See “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions”.

So long as the Offered Notes are held in global form, the common depositories for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable (or their respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the
Note Trust Deed governing the Class B2 Notes and under the Exchangeable Note Trust Deed governing the Exchangeable
Notes, as applicable. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry
Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Offered Notes under the Note Trust Deed or
Exchangeable Note Trust Deed, as applicable.

By acquiring an Offered Note (or interest therein), each purchaser and transferee is deemed to represent, warrant
and covenant that (a) either (1) it is not a Plan and is not acting on behalf of any Plan or (2) its acquisition, holding and
disposition of the Offered Note (or any interest therein) will not (A) constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or (B) result in a violation of any Similar Law, and (b) it will not
transfer the Offered Note (or interest therein) to any transferee that is a Plan or any person acting on behalf of any Plan.

None of the Issuer, the Exchangeable Note Issuer, the Class B Note Trustee or Exchangeable Note Trustee will have
any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable,
will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by them in respect of
the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry

300


-----

Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption
of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if
fewer than all the Offered Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective
participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair
and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of £100,000 principal amount or less may be redeemed in
part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer or the Exchangeable Note Issuer, as applicable, will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of
the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the common depositary or
its nominee for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
respective procedures. The Issuer or the Exchangeable Note Issuer, as applicable, will make payments of all such amounts
without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental
charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under the captions “Terms and Conditions of
_the Class B2 Notes — Taxes — Additional Amounts” and “Terms and Conditions of the Exchangeable Notes — Taxation” in_
Annex A hereto. If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under the captions
“Terms and Conditions of the Class B2 Notes — Taxes — Additional Amounts” and “Terms and Conditions of the
_Exchangeable Notes — Taxation” in Annex A hereto, as applicable, the Issuer or the Exchangeable Note Issuer, as applicable,_
will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or
owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner
would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such
withholding or deduction. The Issuer and the Exchangeable Note Issuer each expects that standing customer instructions and
customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of (a) the Note Trust Deed, the Issuer, the Class B Note Trustee and the relevant Paying Agent, and
(b) the Exchangeable Note Trust Deed, the Exchangeable Note Issuer, the Exchangeable Note Trustee and the relevant Paying
Agent, in each case, will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (e.g. Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective
nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the
Issuer, the Exchangeable Note Issuer, the Class B Note Trustee, Exchangeable Note Trustee or any of their respective Paying
Agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for (1) any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, (2) Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant or
(3) the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such
participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will
be paid to the holders of interests in such Offered Notes in pounds sterling.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer and the Exchangeable Note Issuer that they will take any action
permitted to be taken by a holder of Offered Notes (including the presentation of Offered Notes for exchange as described
herein) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests are credited and only in
respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Offered Notes as to which such participant or participants has or
have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or
the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Note Trust
Deed or under the Exchangeable Note Trust Deed, as applicable, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right, at the
request of the holders of the Offered Notes, to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered notes in certificated form
(“Definitive Notes”) and to distribute Definitive Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Notes
for any reason, including to sell Offered Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require physical delivery of securities or to
pledge such Offered Notes, such holder must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set out in the Note Trust Deed or
Exchangeable Note Trust Deed, as applicable.

301


-----

Each Global Note will have a legend to the effect set out under “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions.”
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements
discussed under “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions.” Transfers of Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject
to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification to the effect that such transfer is being made
in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available) under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification to the effect that such transfer is being
made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or
otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions” and in
accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange between a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest and a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease or increase, as applicable, in the principal
amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding decrease or increase, as applicable, in the principal amount of
the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned
Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all
transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it
remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Notes**

Under the terms of the Note Trust Deed or the Exchangeable Note Trust Deed, as applicable, owners of the BookEntry Interests will receive Definitive Notes if:

      - the Issuer or Exchangeable Note Issuer, as applicable, has been notified that Euroclear or Clearstream have
been closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, whether statutory
or otherwise) or have announced an intention permanently to cease business or have in fact done so and, in any
such case, no successor clearing system satisfactory to the Class B Note Trustee or the Exchangeable Note
Trustee, as applicable, is available; or

      - if the Issuer or the Exchangeable Note Issuer, as applicable, has or will become subject to adverse tax
consequences which would not be suffered were the Offered Note represented by the Global Note in definitive
form.

In such an event, the Class B Registrar or Exchangeable Note Registrar, as applicable, will issue Definitive Notes,
registered in the name or names and issued in denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof,
requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream, the Issuer or the Exchangeable Note Issuer, as applicable (in accordance
with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial
ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Note Trust
Deed or Exchangeable Note Trust Deed, as applicable, unless that legend is not required by such Note Trust Deed or
Exchangeable Note Trust Deed, as applicable, or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Exchangeable Note Issuer, the Class B Note Trustee, the
Exchangeable Note Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Class B Registrar and the Exchangeable Note Registrar, as applicable,
shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for
treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time
at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Offered Notes.

Neither the Issuer nor the Exchangeable Note Issuer will impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Offered
Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and
operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors.
The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any
time. None of the Issuer, the Exchangeable Note Issuer or the Joint Bookrunners is responsible for those operations or
procedures.

302


-----

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for
participating organisations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective
participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide
various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing
of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies
and certain other organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream
participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who, in turn, act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that
do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited
by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical
delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be
limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions
attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Offered Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock
Exchange and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange. Transfers of interests in the
Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their
respective rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation
to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None
of us, the Joint Bookrunners, the Class B Note Trustee, the Exchangeable Note Issuer or any Paying Agent will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Offered Notes will be made in pounds sterling. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional notes in registered form.
Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business
day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry
Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired
value date.

303

**TAXATION**

_If you are a prospective investor, you should consult your tax advisor on the possible tax consequences of buying,_
_holding or selling any Offered Notes under the laws of your country of citizenship, residence or domicile, including the effect_
_of any local taxes applicable to you. The discussions that follow do not purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax_
_considerations which may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or sell the Offered Notes. In particular, these_
_discussions do not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to you. The discussions that follow for each_
_jurisdiction are based upon the applicable laws and interpretations thereof as in effect as of the date of this Offering Circular._
_These tax laws and interpretations are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect._

**U.S. TAXATION**

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary based on present law of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations
relevant to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Exchangeable Notes and the Class B2 Notes. This discussion
addresses only U.S. Holders who purchase the Exchangeable Notes in the original offering at the original offering price, hold
the Exchangeable Notes and will hold the Class B2 Notes as capital assets and use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
This discussion is not a complete description of all U.S. tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition
of the Exchangeable Notes and the Class B2 Notes. It does not address the tax treatment of investors subject to special rules,
such as banks, dealers, traders that elect to mark-to-market, insurance companies, investors liable for the alternative minimum
tax, U.S. expatriates, tax-exempt entities or persons holding the Exchangeable Notes or the Class B2 Notes as part of a hedge,
straddle, conversion or other integrated financial transaction or holding the Exchangeable Notes or the Class B2 Notes in
connection with a permanent establishment outside of the United States. It also does not address U.S. federal taxes other than
income tax (e.g., estate and gift taxes), U.S. state and local, or non-U.S. tax considerations.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
(i) a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or other business entity treated as a corporation created or
organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) a trust subject to the control
of a U.S. person and the primary supervision of a U.S. court or (iv) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal
income taxation regardless of its source.

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) that acquires or holds Exchangeable Notes or Class B2 Notes generally will depend upon the
status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners in a partnership that acquires or holds Exchangeable Notes
or Class B2 Notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences to them of the partnership
acquiring, owning and disposing of the Exchangeable Notes or the Class B2 Notes.

**Characterization of the Exchangeable Notes and Class B2 Notes**

Although the proper characterization of the Exchangeable Notes and the Class B2 Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes is not entirely free from doubt, the Issuer and the Exchangeable Note Issuer, as applicable, intend to treat the
Exchangeable Notes and the Class B2 Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This characterization is
binding on all U.S. Holders unless the holder discloses on its U.S. federal income tax return that it is treating the
Exchangeable Notes and the Class B2 Notes in a manner inconsistent with the Issuer’s or the Exchangeable Note Issuer’s (as
applicable) characterization. However, the Issuer’s and the Exchangeable Note Issuer’s characterization is not binding on the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or the courts, and no ruling is being requested or could be obtained from the IRS
with respect to the proper characterization of the Exchangeable Notes and Class B2 Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. No assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert that the Exchangeable Notes and the Class B2 Notes should
be treated as equity interests in the Exchangeable Note Issuer or the Issuer, respectively, rather than indebtedness nor that a
court would not sustain that position if asserted. The following discussion assumes that the Exchangeable Notes and the
Class B2 Notes will be characterized as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Prospective purchasers of the
Exchangeable Notes or the Class B2 Notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the consequences in the event that
the Exchangeable Notes or the Class B2 Notes are treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The rules applicable to debt instruments with payment contingencies are unclear. If the exercise of the Issuer’s
option to redeem the Class B2 Notes and the exercise of the holders’ option to have their Class B2 Notes repurchased in the
event of a Class B2 Change of Control are not remote, the Class B2 Notes could be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Class B2 Notes were so treated, all stated interest received by U.S.
Holders would be treated as original issue discount (as described below) and U.S. Holders’ gain on a sale or other taxable
disposition of the Class B2 Notes would be treated as ordinary gain. The Issuer intends to take the position that the Class B2
Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments, but no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert a contrary
position. Prospective purchasers of the Class B2 Notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the treatment of the
Class B2 Notes as contingent payment debt instruments.

-----

**Exchangeable Notes**

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Exchangeable Notes will be issued with original issue discount (“OID”). The amount of OID on an
Exchangeable Note will be the excess of the sum of the principal amount of the Exchangeable Note plus stated interest
payable on the Exchangeable Note to its maturity date over the issue price of the Exchangeable Note. The issue price of an
Exchangeable Note will be the first price at which a substantial amount of the Exchangeable Notes are sold to the public (not
including sales to underwriters, distributors or similar persons). An accrual basis U.S. Holder generally will be required to
include in income the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to an Exchangeable Note for each day during the
taxable year or portion of the taxable year in which such holder held such Exchangeable Note. The “daily portion” of OID
generally will be determined by daily proration based on the number of days the Exchangeable Note has been held to the
number of days in the interest accrual period. However, a U.S. Holder may elect to calculate accrued OID on a constant yield
to maturity basis with daily compounding. Any such election, once made, is irrevocable.

**_Exchange or Disposition of Exchangeable Notes_**

Upon the sale, redemption or disposition of an Exchangeable Note or the exchange of an Exchangeable Note for a
Class B2 Note, a U.S. Holder will recognize (i) U.S. source ordinary income equal to the ratable share of accrued OID on the
Exchangeable Notes that has accrued to the date of disposition (in the case of a cash basis U.S. Holder, only to the extent of
gain on the Exchangeable Note, and, in the case of an accrual basis U.S. Holder, to the extent the OID has not previously been
included in income) and (ii) gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount
realized (less the amount of the accrued OID required to be included on the date of disposition) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted
tax basis in the Exchangeable Note, determined in U.S. dollars.

In the case of a cash basis U.S. Holder, the ratable share of accrued OID on an Exchangeable Note that has accrued
to the date of disposition generally will be determined by daily proration based on the number of days the Exchangeable Note
has been held to the number of days in the interest accrual period. A cash basis U.S. Holder may also make an election to
calculate accrued interest on a constant yield to maturity with daily compounding. Any such election, once made, is
irrevocable.

The U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on a disposition of an Exchangeable Note will be the U.S. dollar value
of the pounds sterling or other currency received at the spot rate on the date of disposition (or, if the Exchangeable Notes are
treated as traded on an established securities exchange (and, in the case of an accrual basis U.S. Holder, such holder so elects),
the settlement date) or, in the case of an exchange, the U.S. dollar value of the fair market value of the Class B2 Note received
in the exchange (which fair market value should be determined by reference to the market value of an Exchangeable Note on
the date of the exchange). A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in an Exchangeable Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value
of the pounds sterling used to purchase the Exchangeable Note at the spot exchange rate on the settlement date increased, in
the case of an accrual basis U.S. Holder, by the U.S. dollar amount of any accrued OID that such U.S. Holder previously has
included in income. Any gain realized by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be treated as ordinary income from U.S. source to the
extent the gain does not exceed the accrued OID on the disposition date and, to the extent the gain exceeds the amount of
OID, short-term capital gain, except to the extent of any foreign currency exchange gain. Any loss will, except to the extent of
any foreign currency exchange loss, be short-term capital loss. Any gain or loss realized by an accrual basis U.S. Holder will
be from U.S. source and will, except to the extent of any foreign currency exchange gain or loss, be short-term capital gain or
loss.

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on disposition of an Exchangeable
Note equal to (i) the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Exchangeable Note on the date of
acquisition and the date of disposition and (ii) the difference between the U.S. dollar amount of accrued OID (based on the
average exchange rate during the term of the Exchangeable Notes) and the U.S. dollar value of the payment received at the
spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. U.S. Holders may elect to translate accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the spot
exchange rate on the last day of the accrual period. Currency translation elections apply to all debt instruments that the
electing U.S. Holder holds or acquires, and they cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. Foreign currency exchange
gain or loss cannot exceed overall gain or loss realized on disposition of the Exchangeable Note. Exchange gain or loss will be
U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**Class B2 Notes**

**_Interest_**

Except as described below, interest on the Class B2 Notes, including Additional Amounts, if any, generally will be
includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder in accordance with its regular method of tax accounting. The interest on the
Class B2 Notes generally will be ordinary income from sources outside the United States. Subject to applicable limitations, a
U.S. Holder may claim a deduction or a foreign tax credit only for tax withheld at the appropriate rate.

305


-----

Because the interest rate on the Class B2 Notes steps down on the Class B2 Note Step-Down Date, all Class B2
Notes will be treated as issued with OID which must be accrued into a U.S. Holder’s income on a constant yield to maturity
basis whether or not such U.S. Holder receives cash payments. Generally, the Class B2 Notes will have OID to the extent that
their stated redemption price at maturity exceeds their issue price. The issue price of the Class B2 Notes will be the fair
market value of the Exchangeable Notes on the date the Exchangeable Notes are exchanged for the Class B2 Notes, less the
amount of unpaid accrued interest on the Class B2 Notes on the Exchange Date (the “pre-issuance accrued interest”). The
stated redemption price at maturity is the total of all payments due on a Class B2 Note other than payments of qualified stated
interest. In general, qualified stated interest is interest that is unconditionally payable at least annually at a single fixed rate or,
subject to certain conditions, one or more qualified floating rates. Interest payments on the Class B2 Notes will be qualified
stated interest only to the extent of the interest rate payable after the Class B2 Note Step-Down Date (i.e., the lowest rate of
interest payable on the Class B2 Notes). Any interest in excess of this amount, including stated interest in excess of interest
rate payable after the Class B2 Note Step-Down Date will be treated as OID whether paid before or after the Class B2 Note
Step-Down Date. The redemption premium that the Issuer must offer to pay in a Class B2 Change of Control Offer following
a Class B2 Change of Control is not part of the stated redemption price for this purpose because the Issuer does not believe
that a Class B2 Change of Control is significantly more likely than not to occur. OID will be ordinary income from sources
outside of the United States.

A U.S. Holder generally must include in income the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Class B2
Note for each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year in which such holder held that Class B2 Note
(“accrued OID”). The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the
OID allocable to that accrual period. The “accrual period” for a debt instrument issued with OID may be of any length and
may vary in length over the term of the debt instrument, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each
scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs on the first day or the final day of an accrual period. OID for any accrual
period will be determined in pounds sterling and then translated into U.S. dollars in the same manner as other interest income
accrued by an accrual method U.S. Holder, as described above.

The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of: (i) the product of the Class B2 Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of the accrual period and its
yield to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the
length of the accrual period, over (ii) the aggregate of all qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. OID
allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity, other than a payment of qualified
stated interest, and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. Special rules will apply for calculating
OID for an initial short accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a note at the beginning of any accrual period is equal to
its issue price increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period, and reduced by any payments previously made on
the note other than a payment of qualified stated interest (including payments of stated interest in excess of qualified stated
interest).

A U.S. Holder may elect to include in gross income all yield on a Class B2 Note using a constant yield method. The
constant yield election generally will apply only to the Class B2 Note with respect to which it is made, and it may not be
revoked without the consent of the IRS.

A cash basis U.S. Holder receiving stated interest in pounds sterling must include in income a U.S. dollar amount
based on the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt whether or not the payment is converted to U.S. dollars. An accrual
basis U.S. Holder (and a cash basis U.S. Holder accruing OID) generally must include in income a U.S. dollar amount based
on the average exchange rate during the accrual period (or, for an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the partial
accrual period within each taxable year). Upon receipt of a payment of stated interest or OID in pounds sterling (including,
upon the sale, redemption or other disposition of a Class B2 Note, the receipt of proceeds which include accrued OID and
accrued, unpaid interest previously included in income), U.S. Holders that have accrued interest or OID will recognize
exchange gain or loss equal to any difference between the U.S. dollar amount accrued and the U.S. dollar value of the
payment received at the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Exchange gain or loss will be U.S. source ordinary income
or loss.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder (and a cash basis U.S. Holder with respect to OID) may elect to translate accrued
interest into U.S. dollars at the spot exchange rate on the last day of the accrual period (or, for an accrual period that spans two
taxable years, in the case of the first partial period, the last day of the taxable year) or, with respect to interest received within
five business days of the last day of an interest accrual period, the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Currency
translation elections apply to all debt instruments that the electing U.S. Holder holds or acquires, and they cannot be revoked
without the consent of the IRS.

For purposes of this discussion, the “spot exchange rate” generally means a rate that reflects a fair market rate of
exchange available to the public for currency under a “spot contract” in a free market and involving representative amounts. A
“spot contract” is a contract to buy or sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar on or before two business days following the
date of the execution of the contract. If such a spot rate cannot be demonstrated, the IRS has the authority to determine the
spot rate. The “average rate” for an accrual period (or partial period) is the average of the spot exchange rates for each
business day of such period or other average exchange rate for the period reasonably derived and consistently applied by a
U.S. Holder.

306


-----

U.S. Holders should treat the amount of pre-issuance accrued interest as a separate amount purchased on the
Exchange Date, rather than as part of the issue price of the Class B2 Notes, and they should treat a commensurate portion of
the interest received on the first interest payment date as a return of the pre-issuance accrued interest they were treated as
purchasing on the Exchange Date. A U.S. Holder generally would be required to recognize exchange gain or loss, as
discussed below, in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the pre-issuance accrued
interest at the time of purchase and at the time the payment of such pre-issuance accrued interest is received, as determined at
the spot rate in effect on each such date.

**_Sale, Redemption or other Disposition_**

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale, redemption or other disposition of a Class B2 Note
in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized (less any accrued but unpaid
interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income to the extent not previously included in income) and the U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Class B2 Note, determined in U.S. dollars. The U.S. dollar amount realized will be the value
of the pounds sterling received at the spot exchange rate on the date of disposition (or, if the Class B2 Notes are traded on an
established securities exchange and the holder is a cash basis or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder, the settlement date). A
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Class B2 Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the fair market value of the
Exchangeable Notes on the date the Exchangeable Notes are exchanged for Class B2 Notes, increased by the U.S. dollar
amount of OID included in the U.S. Holder’s income with respect to the Class B2 Note and less (i) the amount of pre-issuance
accrued interest on the Class B2 Notes on the Exchange Date and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of any OID payments (including
stated interest in excess of qualified stated interest) and principal payments previously received by the holder.

Gain or loss on disposition of a Class B2 Note generally will be U.S. source and will, except to the extent of any
foreign currency exchange gain or loss, be capital gain or loss. A U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency
exchange gain or loss on disposition of a Class B2 Note equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the principal
amount of the Class B2 Note on the date of acquisition and the date of disposition. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss
cannot exceed overall gain or loss realized on disposition of the Class B2 Note. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term
capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Class B2 Note for more than one year. The long-term capital gains of noncorporate U.S. Holders may be taxed at lower rates. Deductions for capital losses are subject to limitations.

**_Foreign Currency Exchange Gain or Loss_**

A U.S. Holder will have a tax basis in pounds sterling received as interest on the Notes equal to the U.S. dollar
value of the pounds sterling received translated at the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. A U.S. Holder will have a tax
basis in pounds sterling received on the disposition of an Exchangeable Note or a Class B2 Note equal to the U.S. dollar
amount realized. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on a sale or other disposition of the pounds sterling generally will
be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**_Medicare Tax on Net Investment Income_**

Certain non-corporate U.S. Holders whose income exceeds certain thresholds generally will be subject to a 3.8%
surtax tax on their “net investment income” (which generally includes, among other things, interest and capital gain from the
sale or other disposition of securities). Non-corporate U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the
possible effect of such tax on their ownership and disposition of Exchangeable Notes and Class B2 Notes.

**Class B2 Further Notes**

The Issuer may issue Class B2 Further Notes in additional offerings and these Class B2 Further Notes may not be
fungible with the Class B2 Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Whether Class B2 Further Notes would be fungible
depends on whether the issuance of Class B2 Further Notes would be treated as a qualified reopening for U.S. federal tax
purposes. This determination will depend on the date when the Class B2 Further Notes are issued, the yield of the Class B2
Notes at that time (based on their fair market value), whether the Class B2 Notes were issued with OID and whether the
Class B2 Notes are publicly traded or quoted at the time of the Class B2 Further Notes issuance. If issuance of the Class B2
Further Notes is not a qualified reopening, the Class B2 Further Notes may have OID (or a different amount of OID), which
may adversely affect the market value of the Class B2 Notes, unless the Class B2 Further Notes can be distinguished from the
Class B2 Notes.

**Reportable Transactions**

U.S. Treasury regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions could be interpreted to
cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under these U.S.
Treasury regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances, a sale,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a debt instrument or foreign currency received in respect of a debt
instrument to the extent that such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of
$50,000, in the case of an individual holder and certain higher threshold amounts in the case of other holders. Prospective
investors should consult their own tax advisors about the possibility of becoming subject to the reportable transactions rules.

307


-----

**Information reporting and backup withholding**

Payments of interest and proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of an Exchangeable Note or
Class B2 Note may be reported to the IRS unless the holder is a corporation or otherwise establishes a basis for exemption.
Backup withholding tax may apply to amounts subject to reporting if the holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer
identification number or fails to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal income tax returns.
A U.S. Holder can claim a credit against its U.S. federal income tax liability for the amount of any backup withholding tax
and a refund of any excess. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification for exemption from
backup withholding and the procedure for establishing an exemption.

Certain non-corporate U.S. Holders are required to report information with respect to their investment in
Exchangeable Note or Class B2 Notes not held through an account with a financial institution to the IRS. Investors who fail to
report required information could become subject to substantial penalties. Potential investors are encouraged to consult with
their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this new legislation on their investment in Exchangeable Note or
Class B2 Notes.

**THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT**
**MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS URGED**
**TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT IN**
**EXCHANGEABLE NOTES OR CLASS B2 NOTES IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.**

**United Kingdom Taxation**

The following applies only to persons who are the beneficial owners of the Offered Notes and is a summary of the
Issuer’s understanding of current United Kingdom law and HMRC published practice in the United Kingdom relating only to
United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments of interest on the Offered Notes. The comments below may not apply
to certain classes of person. The following is not exhaustive and does not deal with any other United Kingdom taxation
implications of acquiring, holding or disposing of Offered Notes. The United Kingdom tax treatment of prospective
Noteholders depends on their individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. Prospective Noteholders
who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom or who may be unsure as to their tax position
should seek their own professional advice.

**_Payment of Interest on the Class B2 Notes_**

Payments of interest on the Class B2 Notes may be made without deduction of or withholding on account of United
Kingdom income tax provided that the Class B2 Notes are and continue to be listed on a “recognised stock exchange” within
the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Irish Stock Exchange is a recognised stock exchange. The
Class B2 Notes will satisfy this requirement if they are officially listed in Ireland in accordance with provisions corresponding
to those generally applicable in EEA states and are admitted to trading on the Main Market of the Irish Stock Exchange.
Provided, therefore, that the Class B2 Notes remain so listed, interest on the Class B2 Notes will be payable without
withholding or deduction on account of United Kingdom tax.

Interest on the Class B2 Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction on account of United Kingdom
tax where interest on the Class B2 Notes is paid by a company and, at the time the payment is made, the Issuer reasonably
believes (and any person by or through whom interest on the Class B2 Notes is paid reasonably believes) that the beneficial
owner is within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax as regards the payment of interest, provided that HMRC have
not given a direction (in circumstances where it has reasonable grounds to believe that the above exemption is not available in
respect of such payment of interest at the time the payment is made) that the interest should be paid under deduction of tax.

In other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Class B2 Notes that has a
United Kingdom source on account of United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%). However, where an
applicable double tax treaty provides for a lower rate of withholding tax (or for no tax to be withheld) in relation to a
Noteholder, HMRC can issue a notice to the Issuer to pay interest to the Noteholder without deduction of tax (or for interest to
be paid with tax deducted at the rate provided for in the relevant double tax treaty).

**_Payment of Interest on the Exchangeable Notes_**

Payments of interest on the Exchangeable Notes may be paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of
United Kingdom income tax provided that the interest payable on the Exchangeable Notes is “short” interest. The interest
payable on the Exchangeable Notes will be “short” interest so long as the Exchangeable Notes have a maturity date less than
one year from the date of issue and the Exchangeable Notes are not issued under arrangements, the intended effect or actual
effect of which is to render the Exchangeable Notes part of a borrowing with a total term of a year or more.

308


-----

Even if the interest payable on the Exchangeable Notes did not constitute not “short” interest, interest on the
Exchangeable Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction on account of United Kingdom tax where interest on
the Exchangeable Notes is paid by a company and, at the time the payment is made, the Issuer reasonably believes (and any
person by or through whom interest on the Exchangeable Notes is paid reasonably believes) that the beneficial owner is
within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax as regards the payment of interest, provided that HMRC have not given
a direction (in circumstances where it has reasonable grounds to believe that the above exemption is not available in respect of
such payment of interest at the time the payment is made) that the interest should be paid under deduction of tax.

In other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Exchangeable Notes that has
a United Kingdom source on account of United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%). However, where an
applicable double tax treaty provides for a lower rate of withholding tax (or for no tax to be withheld) in relation to a
Noteholder, HMRC can issue a notice to the Issuer to pay interest to the Noteholder without deduction of tax (or for interest to
be paid with tax deducted at the rate provided for in the relevant double tax treaty).

**_HMRC information gathering powers_**

HMRC have powers to obtain information and documents relating to the Offered Notes, including in relation to
issues of and other transactions in the Offered Notes, interest, payments treated as interest and other payments derived from
the Offered Notes. This may include details of the beneficial owners of the Offered Notes, of the persons for whom the
Offered Notes are held and of the persons to whom payments derived from the Offered Notes are or may be paid. Information
may be obtained from a range of persons including persons who effect or are a party to such transactions on behalf of others,
registrars and administrators of such transactions, the registered holders of the Offered Notes, persons who make, receive or
are entitled to receive payments derived from the Offered Notes and persons by or through whom interest and payments
treated as interest are paid or credited. Information obtained by HMRC may be provided to tax authorities in other countries.

**Certain Jersey taxation considerations**

The following summary of the anticipated treatment of the Exchangeable Note Issuer, the Issuer, holders of the
Exchangeable Notes (other than residents of Jersey) and holders of the Class B2 Notes (other than residents of Jersey) is based
on Jersey taxation law and practice as they are understood to apply at the date of this document and is subject to changes in
such taxation law and practice. It does not constitute legal or tax advice and does not address all aspects of Jersey tax law and
practice. Prospective investors in the Exchangeable Notes and Class B2 Notes should consult their professional advisers on
the implications of acquiring, buying, selling or otherwise disposing of the Exchangeable Notes and the Class B2 Notes under
the laws of any jurisdiction in which they may be liable to taxation.

**_Taxation of the Issuer_**

The Exchangeable Note Issuer and the Issuer are not regarded as resident for tax purposes in Jersey. Therefore,
neither the Exchangeable Note Issuer or the Issuer will be liable to Jersey income tax other than on Jersey source income
(except where such income is exempted from income tax pursuant to the Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961, as amended) and
payments in respect of the Exchangeable Notes and the Class B2 Notes may be paid by the Exchangeable Note Issuer or the
Issuer (as applicable) without withholding or deduction for or on account of Jersey income tax. The holders of the
Exchangeable Notes and the Class B2 Notes (other than residents of Jersey) will not be subject to any tax in Jersey in respect
of the holding, sale or other disposition of such Exchangeable Notes or Class B2 Notes.

**_EU Savings Directive — Jersey_**

From 1 January 2015, paying agents established in Jersey must report to the Jersey Comptroller of Taxes details of
all payments of interest, or other similar income, made to an individual beneficial owner resident in an EU Member State. The
Jersey Comptroller of Taxes will be required to provide to the tax authorities of the Member State in which such a beneficial
owner is resident, details of such payments made to such beneficial owner.

This exchange of information system in Jersey is implemented by means of bilateral agreements with each of the
Member States and the Taxation (Agreements with European Union Member States) (Jersey) Regulations 2005, as amended
with reference to Guidance Notes issued by the Chief Minister’s Department of the States of Jersey. Based on these provisions
and what is understood to be the current practice of the Jersey tax authorities, the Exchangeable Note Issuer and the Issuer
would not be obliged under those provisions to report to the Jersey Comptroller of Taxes payments of interest, or other similar
income, made by it to a paying agent established outside Jersey.

Jersey, along with other dependent and associated territories, will consider the effect of the EU Amending Directive
on the taxation of savings income in the context of existing bilateral agreements and domestic law. It is not expected that this
will result in changes to the treatment of payments by the Exchangeable Note Issuer or the Issuer.

309


-----

**EU Savings Directive**

Under Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (referred to herein as the EU Savings
Directive) Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of
interest and other similar income paid or secured by a person established in a Member State to, or for, the benefit of an
individual resident in another Member State or certain limited types of entities established in another Member State.

On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the
scope of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new requirements from 1 January 2017.
The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the Directive, in particular to include additional types of income
payable on securities. The Directive will also apply a “look through approach” to payments made via certain persons, entities
or legal arrangements (including trusts and partnerships), where certain conditions are satisfied, where an individual resident
in a Member State is regarded as the beneficial owner of the payment for the purposes of the Directive. This approach may in
some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European
Union.

For a transitional period, Austria is instead required (unless during such period it elects otherwise) to operate a
withholding tax in relation to such payments (Luxembourg, which before 1 January 2015 also operated a withholding tax
under the transitional rules, has now replaced such withholding tax with the information reporting regime described above).
No withholding will be required where the Noteholder authorises the person making the payment to report the payment or
presents a certificate from the relevant tax authority establishing exemption therefrom. The transitional period will end after
agreement on exchange of information is reached between the EU and certain non-EU states.

A number of non-EU countries and territories, including Switzerland, have adopted equivalent measures (a
withholding system in the case of Switzerland).

However, the European Commission has proposed the repeal of the EU Savings Directive from 1 January 2017 in
the case of Austria and from 1 January 2016 in the case of all other Member States (subject to on-going requirements to fulfil
administrative obligations such as the reporting and exchange of information relating to, and accounting for withholding taxes
on, payments made before those dates). This is to prevent overlap between the EU Savings Directive and a new automatic
exchange of information regime to be implemented under Council Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative Cooperation in
the field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU). The proposal also provides that, if it proceeds,
Member States will not be required to apply the new requirements of the EU Amending Directive.

The attention of Noteholders is drawn to Condition 7 of the Terms and Conditions of the Class B2 Notes and
Condition 8 of the Terms and Conditions of the Exchangeable Notes.

**The proposed financial transaction tax**

On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a
Directive for a common financial transaction tax (“FTT”) in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy,
Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the “participating Member States”).

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Offered
Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside
of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Offered Notes where at least one party
is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be,
or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by
transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to
the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.

Joint statements issued by participating Member States indicate an intention to implement the FTT by 1 January
2016.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States and the scope
of any such tax is uncertain. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of the Offered Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of Offered Notes by
(i) “employee benefit plans” that are subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(“ERISA”), (ii) “plans” (including individual retirement accounts) as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code,
(iii) any plan, account or arrangement (including, without limitation, governmental, church and non-U.S. plans) that, while not
subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, is subject to other federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations
that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code (“Similar Laws”), and (iv) entities whose
underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” (within the meaning of ERISA or Similar Law) of any such plans,
accounts and arrangements described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) (each, a “Plan”). This summary is general in nature and is not
intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons
involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering
purchasing the Offered Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their own counsel to determine
whether such Plan is subject to Title I of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or any other Similar Law, in which case you may
be prohibited from purchasing, acquiring or holding the Offered Notes.

In analysing these considerations with your own counsel, prospective purchasers of the Offered Notes should
consider, among other things, the discussion under “Taxation.” While such discussion assumes the Offered Notes will be
treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such characterisation is not entirely clear, and no assurances can be given
that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not uphold, a different characterisation of the Offered Notes.

**General Fiduciary Considerations**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its
fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or
control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan,
or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, to such an ERISA Plan, is generally
considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

When considering an investment in the Offered Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code or any other Similar Law relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without
limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and
any other Similar Law.

**Prohibited Transaction Considerations**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions
involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or
“disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or administrative exemption or
exception is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

The acquisition or holding of the Offered Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the
Exchangeable Note Issuer, Center Parcs and any of their affiliates are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person
may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the
Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory or administrative exemption or
exception. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor (the “DOL”) has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions
(“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Offered Notes. These exemptions include, without limitation,
PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by
an “independent qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by an insurance company
general account), PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager) and PTCE 90-1 (relating to
investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts). In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code could provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the ERISA
Plan; provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any
discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in
the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the
transaction. There can be no assurance that any of the PTCEs or any other exemption or exception will be available with
respect to any particular transaction involving the Offered Notes, or that, if any of the PTCEs or another exemption or
exception is available, it will cover all aspects of any particular transaction.

Because of the foregoing, the Offered Notes should not be purchased, held or disposed of by any Plan or any person
acting on behalf of any Plan, unless such purchase, holding or disposition, as applicable, would not constitute or result in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA, the Code or any other Similar Law.

311


-----

**Plan Asset Considerations**

Regulations promulgated under ERISA by the DOL, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (together, the “Plan
**Asset Regulations”), provide that when an ERISA Plan acquires an “equity interest” in an entity that is neither a “publicly**
offered security” nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act, the ERISA
Plan’s assets include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of the entity unless it is
established either that equity participation in the entity by “benefit plan investors” is not “significant” or that the entity is an
“operating company,” in each case as defined in the Plan Asset Regulations. For purposes of the Plan Asset Regulations,
equity participation in an entity by benefit plan investors will not be significant if benefit plan investors hold, in the aggregate,
less than 25% of the value of each class of equity interests of such entity, excluding equity interests held by any person (other
than a “benefit plan investor”) who has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the entity or who
provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets, and any affiliates of such person. For
purposes of this 25% test, “benefit plan investors” include ERISA Plans and any entity whose underlying assets include, or
are deemed for purposes of ERISA or the Code to include, their “plan assets” by reason of such plan’s investment in the entity
under the Plan Asset Regulations, but exclude governmental, church and non-U.S. plans.

While the discussion under “Taxation” assumes the Offered Notes will be treated as debt for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, such characterisation is not entirely clear, and no assurances can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a
court would not uphold, a different characterisation of the Offered Notes. In addition, it is anticipated that (i) the Offered
Notes will not constitute “publicly offered securities” for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulations and (ii) neither the Issuer nor
the Exchangeable Note Issuer will not be an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act.

If the Issuer’s or the Exchangeable Note Issuer’s assets were deemed to be “plan assets” of an ERISA Plan holding
the Offered Notes, this would result in, among other things, (i) the application of the prudence and other fiduciary
responsibility standards of ERISA to investments made by the Issuer or the Exchangeable Note Issuer, as applicable, and
(ii) the possibility that certain transactions that the Issuer or the Exchangeable Note Issuer, as applicable, might enter into, or
may have entered into, in the ordinary course of business might constitute or result in non-exempt prohibited transactions
under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code and might have to be rescinded.

Because of the foregoing, the Offered Notes may not be purchased by, transferred to or otherwise held by any Plan
or any person acting on behalf of any Plan, unless the acquisition, holding or disposition, as applicable, of the Offered Notes
would not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA, the Code or any other Similar Law. In no
case, however, shall benefit plan investors be authorised by the Exchangeable Note Issuer or the Issuer, as applicable, to
subscribe for and purchase, in the aggregate, 25% or more of any class of equity interests of and the Exchangeable Note Issuer
or the Issuer, as applicable. Any purported purchase, transfer or holding in violation of these limitations will be void. If such
purchase or transfer is not treated as being void for any reason, the Offered Notes will automatically be transferred to a
charitable trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and the Plan will acquire no right in the Offered Notes.

**Representations**

Accordingly, each purchaser and holder of the Offered Notes (or any interest therein) will be deemed to have
represented that (A) (i) it is not a Plan and is not acting on behalf of any Plan, or (ii) its acquisition, holding and disposition of
the Offered Notes (or any interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or under any other Similar Law for which an exemption is not available,
and (B) it will not transfer the Offered Notes to any transferee that is a Plan or any person acting on behalf of any Plan.

Any purported purchase, transfer, holding or disposition in violation of these representations will be void. If such
purchase, transfer or disposition is not treated as being void for any reason, the Offered Notes will automatically be
transferred to a charitable trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and the purported holder will acquire no right in the
Offered Notes.

**LIMITATION ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the security interests in each of the_
_jurisdictions in which collateral is being provided. It is a summary only, and bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or a_
_similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions_
_could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your_
_rights and to collect payment in full under the Offered Notes and the security interests on the collateral._

**Jersey Insolvency**

The Issuer and the Exchangeable Note Issuer are each incorporated under the laws of Jersey. In the event of an
insolvency of the Issuer or the Exchangeable Note Issuer, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There are two
principal regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: désastre and winding up (including just and equitable winding up and
creditors’ winding up). The principal type of insolvency procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the application
for an Act of the Royal Court of Jersey under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the “Jersey
Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the property of a debtor to be “en désastre” (a “declaration”). On a declaration of désastre, title
and possession of the property of the debtor vest automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the
“Viscount”). With effect from the date of declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the
debtor, and may not commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount of the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings
to recover the debt.

Additionally, the shareholders of a Jersey company (but not its creditors) can instigate a winding up of an insolvent
company, which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991,
as amended (the “Jersey Companies Law”). On a creditors’ winding up, a liquidator is nominated, usually by the
shareholders. The creditors may approve such a liquidator or apply to appoint a different liquidator. The liquidator will stand
in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding up, gather assets, make appropriate disposals of assets, settle claims
and distribute assets as appropriate. After the commencement of the winding up, no action can be taken or continued against
the company except with the leave of court. The shareholders must however give creditors 14 days’ notice of the meeting to
commence the creditors’ winding up. The corporate state and capacity of the company continues until the end of the winding
up procedure, when the company is dissolved. The Jersey Companies Law requires a creditor of a company (subject to
appeal) to be bound by an arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors immediately before or in the course of its
winding up if, inter alia, three quarters in number and value of the creditors acceded to the arrangement.

**_Transactions at an Undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court may, on the
application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the
case of a creditors’ winding up, a procedure which is instigated by shareholders not creditors), set aside a transaction
(including any guarantee or security interest) entered into by a company with any person (the “other party”) at an undervalue.
There is a five-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during
which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and
Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a
transaction at an undervalue, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into such a transaction with a person
connected with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Preference_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law, the court may, on
the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in
the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a preference (including any guarantee or security interest) given by the company
to any person (the “other party”). There is a 12-month look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or
declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”).
The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that
define what constitutes a preference, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into a preference with a
person connected with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Extortionate Credit Transactions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court may, on
the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in
the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction providing credit to the debtor company which is or was
extortionate. There is a three-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of
“désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and
Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a
transaction which is extortionate.

313


-----

**_Disclaimer of Onerous Property_**

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the date of the
declaration of désastre and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may within six months following the
commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous property of the company. “Onerous property” is defined to
include any moveable property, a contract lease or other immoveable property if it is situated outside of Jersey that is
unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it might give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act,
and includes an unprofitable contract.

A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the “rights, interests and liabilities of the company in
or in respect of the property disclaimed” but “does not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company
from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.” A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of a
disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and shall have standing as a creditor
in the désastre or creditors’ winding up. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions,
including (without limitation) in relation to the power to disclaim onerous property.

**_Fraudulent Dispositions_**

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey customary law
(for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention of defeating creditors’ claims may be set
aside.

**_Security Over Non Jersey Situs Assets_**

Under the laws of Jersey, a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey is deemed to have capacity to grant
security governed by foreign law over property situated outside Jersey, but to the extent that any floating charge is expressed
to apply to any asset, property and undertaking of a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey such floating charge
is not likely to be held valid and enforceable by the Courts of Jersey in respect of Jersey situs assets.

**_Administrators, Receivers and Statutory and Non-statutory Requests for Assistance_**

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the Enterprise
Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators are not part of the laws of
Jersey. Accordingly, the Courts of Jersey may not recognise the powers of an administrator, administrative receiver or other
receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets (although see below in the case of fixed charge receivers).

However, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Jersey court may assist the courts of prescribed
countries and territories and, applying general principles of comity assist the courts in other jurisdictions, in all matters
relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Jersey court thinks fit. These prescribed jurisdictions include the
United Kingdom. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the
model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey.

If the request comes from a non-prescribed country, then common law and principles of comity will be considered
by the Royal Court by virtue of its inherent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in another
jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature
of the requesting country’s insolvency regime.

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should not be assumed that the UNCITRAL
provisions will automatically be followed. That is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. It would also be wrong to
assume for European countries that the position will be in accordance with EU Insolvency Regulation. Jersey does not form
part of the European Community for the purposes of implementation of its directions. Accordingly, the EU Insolvency
Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and the automatic test of centre of main interests does not apply
as a result.

**_Enforcement of Security and Security in Insolvency_**

Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
liquidation, dissolution, re-organisation or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the rights of creditors, and
laws in relation to transactions at undervalue, preference, extortionate credit transactions, disclaimer of onerous property and
fraudulent dispositions also apply in Jersey. Insolvency or bankruptcy alone will not render such security interest invalid or
non-binding on the parties thereto or any liquidator of a Jersey company or the Viscount in a désastre of a Jersey company’s
property. This is subject to certain statutory exceptions, which include (but are not limited to):

      - Article 159(4) of the Jersey Companies Law provides that after the commencement of a creditors’ winding up
of a Jersey company no action shall be taken or proceeded with against the company except by leave of the

314


-----

court and subject to such terms as that court may impose; and Article 10(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law
provides that with effect from the date of a declaration of désastre against a person (the “bankrupt”), a creditor
shall not have any other remedy against the property or person of the bankrupt or commence or (except with
the consent of the Viscount or by order of the court) continue any action or legal proceedings to recover such
creditor’s debt; and

      - In the enforcement of foreign security in Jersey, the Courts of Jersey — properly applying the relevant
provisions of foreign law — are likely to uphold (subject to the comments above) a claim that the relevant
security interest (and other than in respect of any property or assets situated or deemed to be situated in Jersey)
is binding on a Jersey company and any liquidator or other similar person having control of the assets of a
Jersey company.

**_Cayman Islands Insolvency_**

Under Cayman Islands law, insolvency proceedings involve the appointment of a liquidator whose function it is to
act as the agent of the company and: (i) to realise the company’s unsecured assets; (ii) to identify the company’s unsecured
creditors and the amounts of their claims; and (iii) to distribute the proceeds of realisation of the company’s unsecured assets
(net of expenses and claims of preferred creditors) to the company’s unsecured creditors pro rata and, after the creditors have
been paid in full, to distribute the remaining balance (if any) to the company’s shareholders. Cayman Islands legislation
provides for three different procedural systems for winding-up companies, namely: (i) compulsory winding-up by order of the
Cayman Island Court (the “Court”); (ii) voluntary winding-up initiated by a resolution of the shareholders or in accordance
with the provisions of the company’s articles of association; and (iii) voluntary winding-up originally initiated by a resolution
of the shareholders that is subsequently made subject to the supervision of the Court. A petition to the Court for a winding up
order may be made by the company itself or a creditor (including a contingent or prospective creditor) or shareholder of the
company. A winding up order is usually sought by demonstrating to the Court that the company is unable to pay its debts, or
because it is otherwise just and equitable to make a winding-up order. When considering inability to pay debts, Cayman
Islands law requires that the Court have regard to the company’s cash-flow position. When a winding up order is made by the
Court in relevant circumstances, an automatic moratorium on proceedings against the company is imposed and proceedings
may not be commenced or continued against the company except with the express permission of the Court. Dispositions of
property, transfers of shares and alterations in the status of shareholders are void unless approved by the Court. The
moratorium does not affect any valid contractual rights of set-off or subordination agreements acquired or entered into before
the commencement of the liquidation. A secured creditor is entitled to enforce his security without the leave of the Court and
without reference to the liquidator.

It is a rule of Cayman Islands insolvency law that all ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated creditors are treated
equally irrespective of the nature of their claims. This is referred to as the pari passu rule. Local creditors (save in certain
cases for a minimal category of statutorily preferred creditors, including statutory fees and very limited amounts owed to
Cayman Islands employees) do not have any preference or priority over foreign creditors. This rule applies among ordinary
unsecured and unsubordinated creditors existing as of the commencement of the liquidation or whose claims arise out of
causes of action that accrued before the date of the commencement of the liquidation. These will include creditors whose
claims against the company arise out of contract, common law and statutory torts, equitable claims, etc.

There are circumstances under Cayman Islands law in which the granting by a Cayman Islands company of security
can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into insolvency within a specified period (as set
out in more detail below) following the granting of the security.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under Cayman Islands law in respects of Cayman Islands
law governed security interests:

**_Voidable preferences_**

Pursuant to Section 145(1) of the Companies Law (as amended) (the “Companies Law”), a transaction will
constitute a voidable preference in the following circumstances:

(i) a conveyance or transfer of property (or charge thereon) or payment obligation was made, incurred, taken
or suffered by the relevant company in favour of a creditor within 6 months immediately preceding the
commencement of liquidation of the relevant company;

(ii) at the time when the conveyance or transfer of property or payment obligation was made, incurred, taken
or suffered, the relevant company was insolvent (that is, unable to pay its debts when they fell due
pursuant to the applicable law); and

(iii) the conveyance or transfer of property or payment obligation was made, incurred, taken or suffered with a
view to giving the creditor a preference over other creditors. Please note that if the creditor is a “related

315


-----

party” (that is, an entity who has the ability to control the relevant company or exercise significant
influence over the relevant company in making financial and operating decisions), the transfer of property
or payment obligation will be deemed to have been made with a view to giving such a creditor a
preference.

If the above criteria can be satisfied with respect to the transfer of property or payment obligation, the transaction
will be invalid and a liquidator would be able to claw back the property or payment transferred.

**_Fraudulent dispositions_**

Under the Fraudulent Dispositions Law in respect of creditor actions and pursuant to Section 146 of the Companies
Law in respect of liquidator actions, a transaction will constitute a disposition at an undervalue in the following
circumstances:

(i) a disposition (being any type of transfer, conveyance, assignment, lease, mortgage, pledge or other
transaction by which any legal or equitable interest in property is created, transferred or extinguished) of
property is made to a legal entity (either a person or a body corporate);

(ii) the disposition was made by the relevant company at a undervalue (which means for no consideration or
for consideration the value of which in money or monies worth is significantly less than the value of the
property the subject of the disposition); and

(iii) the disposition was made with an intent to defraud its creditors (that is, an intention to wilfully defeat an
obligation or liability (which includes a contingent liability) owed to a creditor which existed on or prior
to the date of the relevant disposition).

If the above criteria can be satisfied with respect to the disposition of property, the disposition shall be voidable at
the instance of the liquidator (under Section 146 of the Companies Law) and/or by the creditor thereby prejudiced (under the
Fraudulent Dispositions Law). No action or proceeding can be commenced by a liquidator or creditor seeking to establish that
a disposition of property constituted a disposition made an undervalue more than 6 years after the date of relevant disposition.
The burden of establishing the intent to defraud lies with the official liquidator and/or the creditor (as applicable).

**_Fraudulent trading_**

Section 147 of the Companies Law provides for a fraudulent trading provision.

Section 147 of the Companies Law provides that if in the course of winding up of the relevant company it appears
that any business of the company has been carried on with an intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any
other person, or for any fraudulent purpose, the liquidator may apply to the Court seeking a declaration in respect of the
conduct or fraudulent trading. Such order would be sought in respect of any persons who were knowingly parties to the
carrying on of the business with an intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any other person, or for any
fraudulent purpose. Such persons would be liable to make such contributions (if any) to the company’s assets as the Court
thinks proper. It is notable that this form of order does not involve the imposition of liability for the company’s debts as such,
but enables the court to form a judgment as to the extent to which it is appropriate to require each participant in a company’s
fraudulent trading to contribute personally to the assets, so as to augment the funds available for distribution to unpaid
creditors. Section 147 uses the term “persons” which enables liability to be imposed upon a wider circle of participants in any
such activity than merely directors and officers. It should be noted further that Section 147 of the Companies Law imposes no
restrictions in terms of the period of time prior to the company’s winding up during which the events must have taken place in
order for liability to be imposed.

Any application brought by a liquidator is brought on behalf of the relevant company’s estate as a whole and not
merely for the benefit of the individual creditors (in an insolvent liquidation) or individual members (in a solvent liquidation).

**_Constructive trusts_**

A liquidator may commence a proceeding against the directors of the relevant company for breach of fiduciary duty
where, for example, the company (by its directors) knowingly divests itself of an asset at an undervalue in breach of the
directors’ duty to act in the best interests of the company. If the recipient who received the asset knew he/she/it was receiving
it as a result of a breach of fiduciary duty, he/she/it may be subject to a constructive trust argument in respect of the asset —
that is the recipient is holding the asset on trust for the company.

To the extent that the relevant company is approaching insolvency or is insolvent (that is, unable to pay their debts
when they fall due), directors still owe their fiduciary duties to the relevant company but, in discharging such duties, they
must have regard to the interests of the creditors of the relevant company. In such circumstances, the risk of a disposition of
property being made in breach of the directors’ fiduciary duties is heightened and a constructive trust may be imposed to the
extent that the entity that receives the relevant property has knowledge that the directors have breached their fiduciary duties
in making the disposition.

316


-----

The imposition of a constructive trust will depend on the factual scenario regarding the relevant payments and the
manner in which they were accepted, however, to the extent that it can be shown that the relevant company was acting in a
commercially reasonable manner and in their best interests (respectively) and the recipients of such payments accepted such
payments in good faith without knowledge of any breach of fiduciary duty, we would not consider the constructive trust head
of relevance.

**_Equitable nature of mortgage over shares_**

The mortgage created by Topco over the shares of CP Cayman Limited to secure the obligations of Topco under the
Topco Payment Undertaking is governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands and comprises an equitable not a legal mortgage.
An equitable mortgage has certain disadvantages compared with a legal mortgage, including the fact that an earlier security
will have priority and a subsequent third party purchaser for value or legal mortgagee of the shares mortgaged, who does not
have notice of the equitable mortgage, will not be subject to it. The courts of the Cayman Islands will not recognise or enforce
foreclosure (meaning the assumption by the mortgagee of beneficial ownership of the mortgaged property and the extinction
of the mortgagor’s equity of redemption therein) against the shares mortgaged pursuant to the mortgage over the shares in CP
Cayman Limited in the absence of foreclosure proceedings against Topco in the courts of the Cayman Islands, or a judgment
in respect of foreclosure proceedings against Topco in the courts of another jurisdiction which the courts of the Cayman
Islands are prepared to enforce in accordance with the usual principles applicable to the enforcement of foreign judgments in
the Cayman Islands.

**_Fixed security and recharacterisation risk_**

It is the essence of a fixed charge that the person creating the charge does not have liberty to deal with the assets
which are the subject matter of the security in the sense of disposing of such assets or expending or appropriating the moneys
or claims constituting such assets and accordingly, if and to the extent that such liberty is given to Topco, any charge
constituted pursuant to the Topco Share Security Agreement entered into by Topco may operate as a floating, rather than a
fixed, charge. Depending upon the level of control actually exercised by the chargor, there is therefore a possibility that the
security granted thereunder would be regarded under the Cayman Islands law as a floating charge. Floating charges have
certain weaknesses, including the following:

(i) they have weak priority against purchasers and chargees (who are not on notice of any negative pledge
contained in the floating charge) of the assets concerned and against lien holders, execution creditors and
creditors with rights of set off;

(ii) the claims of may be subject to prior claims of preferred creditors under Cayman law” above, they rank
after certain preferred creditors, such as claims of employees and certain taxes on winding up; and

(iii) they rank after fixed charges.

**_Preferred creditors_**

Under Cayman Islands law, upon an insolvency of a Cayman Islands company such as Topco, when applying the
proceeds of assets subject to security which may have been realised in the course of a liquidation or receivership, the claims of
a limited category of preferred creditors will take priority over the claims of creditors holding the relevant security. On a
winding up of Topco in the Cayman Islands:

(a) claims by employees (if any) working in the Cayman Islands in respect of severance pay (subject to a
maximum of twelve weeks final basic wage) are paid in priority to all other debts whether unsecured or
secured (and whether that security is fixed or floating); and

(b) the following debts are paid in priority to all unsecured debts or debts secured by a floating charge:

(i) any sum due by Topco to an employee, whether employed in the Cayman Islands or elsewhere,
in respect of salaries, wages and gratuities accrued during the four months immediately
preceding the liquidation;

(ii) any sum due and payable by Topco on behalf of an employee in respect of medical health
insurance or pension fund contributions;

(iii) any sum due in respect of severance pay and earned vacation leave where the employee’s
contract has been terminated as a result of the winding up;

(iv) any compensation payable to a workman in respect of injuries incurred at work pursuant to the
Workmen’s Compensation Law of the Cayman Islands; and

317


-----

(v) certain taxes due to the Cayman Islands Government comprising customs duties, stamp duty,
licence fees, sums payable under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands such as annual
return fees, and sums payable under the Tourist Accommodation (Taxation) Law of the Cayman
Islands.

**_Payment of dividends under Cayman Islands law_**

Under Cayman Islands law, dividends may only be declared by a Cayman Islands company out of funds legally
available for distribution so long as the company has the ability to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of
business.

**European Union**

Certain of the Guarantors of the Class B2 Notes are organised under the laws of a Member State of the European
Union.

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”),
which applies within the European Union (other than Denmark and other than in respect of certain insurance, credit institution
and investment undertakings), the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is
used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The
determination of where a company has its centre of main interests is a question of fact.

Although there is a presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its centre
of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary, Preamble 13
of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the centre of main interests of a “debtor should correspond to the place where the
debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” The courts
have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the centre of main interests of a company, including in
particular where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head
office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established. A company’s centre of main interests
may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to
open main insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency proceedings of the
types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

If the centre of main interests of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the
EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State
(such proceedings being referred to as “territorial insolvency proceedings”). An “establishment” is defined as a place of
operations where the company carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. The effects of those
insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other
Member State.

Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main
interests, any territorial insolvency proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State in which the company has an
establishment are limited to “winding-up proceedings” listed in Annex B of the EU Insolvency Regulation (such subsequent
territorial insolvency proceedings being referred to as “secondary proceedings”). Where main proceedings in the Member
State in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can
be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment only where either: (a) insolvency proceedings
cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated as a result of conditions laid
down by that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor that is
domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the Member State in which the company has an establishment or
whose claim arises from the operation of that establishment.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognise the judgment of the court opening main
proceedings and, subject to any exceptions provided for in the EU Insolvency Regulation, that judgment will be given the
same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The officeholder
appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s centre of main
interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such
as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency
proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a
request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.

**England and Wales**

Certain of the Guarantors of the Class B2 Notes are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Therefore,
any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the such Guarantors would likely be commenced in England and conducted in
accordance with the requirements of English insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, where an

318


-----

English company conducts business in another member state of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the English courts
may be limited if the company’s “centre of main interests” is found to be in another Member State (please see “— European
_Union”). There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the centre of main interests. The centre of main_
interests should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and
is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The place of the registered office of the company is presumed to be the centre of
main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the
relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

**_Fixed and floating charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security: (a) an
administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash, or use cash
subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the
charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed
charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the charged
assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s or administrator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a
winding up or administration are payable out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating
charge) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to deal
with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be
effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge
and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security;
(e) floating charge security is subject to certain challenges under English insolvency law; and (f) floating charge security is
subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions and salaries owed to
employees) and to ring-fencing (see “— Administration and Floating charges”).

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterise fixed security interests purported to be
created by a security document as floating charges; the description given to security interests by the parties is not
determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating
security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant
chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the
chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to
crystallisation, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding
that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents.

**_Administration and Floating charges_**

The relevant English insolvency statute empowers English courts to make an administration order in respect of an
English company in certain circumstances. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors
or the holder of a qualifying floating charge. During the administration, in general no proceedings or other legal process may
be commenced or continued against the company in administration, or security enforced over that company’s property, except
with permission of the court or the consent of the administrator. Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able
to realise their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the
disapplication of the administration moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” (generally, cash or
financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral
Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. During the administration of a company, a creditor would not be able to enforce any
security interest (other than security financial collateral arrangements) without the consent of the administrator or the
permission of the court. In addition, other than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be appointed by a
secured creditor and in limited circumstances, the court can make an administration order, in preference to an administrator, if
the court made an administration order, any administrative receive must vacate office. Where the company is already in
administration no other receiver over the assets of the company may be appointed without the consent of the administration or
the permission of the Court (and no administrative receiver may be appointed).

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be required to ringfence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security (after making full provision for
preferential creditors and expenses (floating charge realisations)) for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law,
this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realisations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a
maximum aggregate cap of £600,000.

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security and
guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation
within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) following the granting of the guarantee or security.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under English law to guarantees and security interests.

**_Transaction at an Undervalue_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation
of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. There will only be a transaction at an

319


-----

undervalue, if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to
pay its debts as a result of such transaction (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act 1986, as amended) and this is presumed in
relation to any transaction or undervalue which is entered into by a company with a person who is connected with the
company. The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings
within a period of two years from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction
might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company
receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth,
than the consideration given by such company. However, a court generally will not intervene if it is satisfied that the company
entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there
were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a
transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in
if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the
company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act
1986, as amended), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the
solvency of the company in such proceedings.

**_Preference_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an order to set
aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such
security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. There will only be a preference if, at the time the transaction was
entered into, the company was unable to pay its debts (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended)) or the
company becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended)) as a consequence of its
entry into the transaction. The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into liquidation or administration
proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two
years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the company takes the decision to grant the security interest or
the guarantee. A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or
guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent
liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If
the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the
position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given, which could, in this case, include reducing
payments under the Class B2 Notes (although there is protection for a third-party who enters into one of the transactions in
good faith and without notice). However, for the court to do so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the
company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or
liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire
to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a
presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must
demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence.

**_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_**

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made for the
purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of
otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the
transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An application to the court for an order to set
aside the transaction may be made by an administrator, a liquidator the supervisor of a voluntary arrangement in certain
circumstances and, subject to certain conditions, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the
UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with
the permission of the court in the case of a company in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside
such transaction. There is no time limit in the English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made and the
relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a
transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have
been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant
court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom
the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a
person other than the debtor in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a
person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to
pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

**_Avoidance of Floating Charge_**

Under English insolvency law, if a company is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of) granting a
floating charge, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below, then such floating charge
can be avoided except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or
reduction of any debt of (and the amount of such interest payable in respect of the money paid, services supplied in reduction/
discharge in debt), the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge.

320


-----

The requirement for the company to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does
not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the floating charge is granted to a connected person,
and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below, then the floating charge is invalid except to
the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of
(and the amount of such interest payable in respect of the money paid, services supplied in reduction/discharge in debt), the
relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge, whether the relevant company is solvent or
insolvent.

The granting of the floating charge can be challenged only if the relevant company enters into liquidation or
administration proceedings within a period of 12 months (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the
beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the relevant company grants the floating charge. However, if the floating
charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2)
Regulations 2003, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Exchangeable Note Issuer and the Joint Bookrunners have entered into a subscription agreement with respect to
the Exchangeable Notes to be dated 2015 (the “Subscription Agreement”) and to which the Issuer and the
Obligors will accede on the Third Closing Date, immediately following the consummation of the Acquisition. Pursuant to the
Subscription Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein, each Joint Bookrunners has agreed,
severally and not jointly, to subscribe and pay for the aggregate principal amounts of the Exchangeable Notes as set out
opposite its name below.

The Joint Bookrunners are entitled to fees and reimbursement of certain expenses pursuant to the Subscription
Agreement. The Joint Bookrunners are entitled in certain circumstances to be released and discharged from their obligations
under the Subscription Agreement prior to the closing of the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes.

The Exchangeable Notes will initially be offered at the price set forth herein. After the initial offering of the
Exchangeable Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Exchangeable Notes may, from time to time, be varied
by the Joint Bookrunners without notice. Sales of the Exchangeable Notes may be made through affiliates of the Joint
Bookrunners or through registered broker-dealers.

The Subscription Agreement provides that the several obligations of the Joint Bookrunners to pay for and accept
delivery of the Exchangeable Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their
counsel. The Subscription Agreement also provides that the Exchangeable Note Issuer (and the Issuer and the Obligors upon
accession to the Subscription Agreement) will indemnify the Joint Bookrunners against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Joint Bookrunners may be required to make in respect
thereof.

Persons who purchase Exchangeable Notes from the Joint Bookrunners may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes
and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth
on the cover page hereof.

The Exchangeable Note Issuer expects that delivery of the Exchangeable Notes will be made against payment on
the respective Exchangeable Notes on or about 2015, which will be the business day (as such term is used
for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Exchangeable Notes (this settlement
cycle is being referred to as “T+ ” (U.S.)). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.

Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Exchangeable Notes on the date of this Offering Circular or the next
succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to
prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Exchangeable Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own
advisors.

The Joint Bookrunners may engage in over-allotment, stabilising transactions, covering transactions and penalty
bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size,
which creates a short position for the relevant Joint Bookrunner. Stabilising transactions permit bidders to purchase the
underlying security so long as the stabilising bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve
purchases of the Offered Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions.
Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Offered Notes
originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilising or covering transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilising Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilise, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Offered Notes. Specifically, the Stabilising Manager,
or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilise the price of the Offered Notes.
The Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position,
and may bid for and purchase Offered Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the
Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as
permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilise or maintain the
respective market price of the Offered Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilising Manager is not
required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to
the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Offered Notes.

**Selling Restrictions**

**_United States_**

The Offered Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold
within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except in certain transactions exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act.

Each Joint Bookrunner has agreed, severally and not jointly, that, except as permitted by the Subscription
Agreement, it will not offer or sell the Offered Notes (a) as part of its distribution at any time or (b) otherwise until
completion of the distribution compliance period, within the United States to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons,
and it will have sent to each dealer to which it sells Offered Notes (other than a sale pursuant to Rule 144A) during the
distribution compliance period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Offered
Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the
meanings given to them by Regulation S.

The Offered Notes are being offered and sold outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S. The
Subscription Agreement provides that the Joint Bookrunners may directly or through their respective U.S. broker-dealer
affiliates arrange for the offer and resale of the relevant Offered Notes in the United States only to persons whom they
reasonably believe are QIBs.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering of the Offered Notes, an offer or sale of Offered
Notes within the United States by a dealer that is participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the
Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A.

The Exchangeable Note Issuer and the Joint Bookrunners reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the
Exchangeable Notes, in whole or in part, for any reason. This Offering Circular does not constitute an offer to any person in
the United States or to any U.S. person other than a QIB and to whom an offer has been made directly by one of the Joint
Bookrunners or its relevant U.S. broker-affiliate. Distribution of this Offering Circular to any person, other than a QIB or to a
non-U.S. person outside the United States and those persons, if any, retained to advise such QIB or non-U.S. person outside
the United States with respect thereto, is unauthorised, and any disclosure without the prior written consent of the
Exchangeable Note Issuer or the Issuer, as applicable, of any of its contents to any person, other than to a QIB or to a nonU.S. person outside the United States and to those persons, if any, retained to advise such QIB or non-U.S. person outside the
United States, is prohibited.

To the extent that any Joint Bookrunner that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of the
Exchangeable Notes in the United States, it will only do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as
permitted by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority guidelines.

**_General_**

Each Joint Bookrunner has undertaken that it will not, directly or indirectly, offer or sell any Offered Notes or have
in its possession, distribute or publish any offering circular, prospectus, form of application, advertisement or other document
or information in any country or jurisdiction except under circumstances that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief,
result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations and all offers and sales of Exchangeable Notes by it will be
made on the same terms.

**Other relationships**

The Class B Global Coordinator and Arranger and the Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates may have
performed various financial advisory, investment banking and commercial banking services for, and may arrange loans and
other non-public market financing for, and enter into derivative transactions with, Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and/or
their affiliates (including its shareholders, the Issuer, the Exchangeable Note Issuer and the other Obligors) and for which they
may receive customary fees and expenses. The Class B Global Coordinator and Arranger and the Joint Bookrunners and their
respective affiliates may provide such services in the future. Each of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and Barclays Bank
PLC are agents and other lenders under the Liquidity Facility Agreement.

(2) IT IS NOT A PARTICIPANT-DIRECTED EMPLOYEE PLAN, SUCH AS A 401(k) PLAN; AND
(3) IT IS HOLDING THIS NOTE FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF
ANOTHER QIB.

EACH BENEFICIAL OWNER HEREOF OR OF ANY INTEREST HEREIN IS DEEMED TO

INTEREST HEREIN (1) EITHER (A) IT IS NOT A PLAN (AS DEFINED BELOW) AND IS NOT
ACTING ON BEHALF OF ANY PLAN OR (B) IT IS NOT AND IS NOT USING ASSETS OF A
BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3(42) OF THE UNITED STATES

5. At the time of its purchase and throughout the period in which it holds such Offered Notes or any interest

assets of a “benefit plan investor” (as defined in Section 3(42) of ERISA), or a governmental, church or
non-U.S. plan that is subject to any Similar Law or any entity whose assets are treated as assets of any
such plan, unless the acquisition, holding and disposition of the Offered Notes or any interest therein
(x) does not violate Section 406 of ERISA, section 4975 of the Code or Similar Law, and (y) will not
subject the Issuer or Exchangeable Note Issuer, as applicable, to any such provision of ERISA, the Code

more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each of those
accounts and that it has full power to make the above acknowledgements, representations and agreements

**WHERE YOU CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**

Neither the Exchangeable Note Issuer nor Issuer is subject to the periodic reporting and other information
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC. However, pursuant to the Note Trust Deed and
for as long as the Class B2 Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish certain periodic information to the Class
B2 Noteholders.

So long as any Exchangeable Notes or Class B2 Notes are outstanding and are “restricted securities” within the
meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, the Exchangeable Note Issuer or the Issuer, as applicable, will, during
any period in which it is neither subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, nor exempt from reporting pursuant to
Rule 12g3-2(b) thereunder, provide to any holder or beneficial owner of such restricted securities or to any prospective
purchaser of such restricted securities designated by such holder or beneficial owner or to the Exchangeable Note Trustee or
Class B Note Trustee, as applicable, for delivery to such holder, beneficial owner or prospective purchaser, in each case upon
the request of such holder, beneficial owner, prospective purchaser or the Class B Note Trustee, the information required to be
provided by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN JUDGMENTS**

The Issuer is a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Jersey. The Exchangeable Note
Issuer is a limited liability company, incorporated under the laws of Jersey. The assets of the Issuer and the Exchangeable
Note Issuer are located outside of the United States. In addition, none of the directors or officers and other executives of the
Issuer or Exchangeable Note Issuer is a resident or citizen of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for
investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer, the Exchangeable Note Issuer or such persons,
or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. federal or state courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of
U.S. federal or state securities laws or otherwise despite the fact that, pursuant to the terms of the Note Trust Deed, the Issuer
has appointed, or will appoint, and pursuant to the Exchangeable Note Trust Deed, the Exchangeable Note Issuer has
appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service of process in New York.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. federal or state court against the Issuer or Exchangeable Note Issuer, investors
will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of
U.S. federal or state court judgments outside the United States is described below for the jurisdictions in which the Issuer or
the Exchangeable Note Issuer and their respective assets are located, you should consult with your own advisors in any
pertinent jurisdictions as needed for advice on enforcing a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**Jersey**

The Issuer and the Exchangeable Note Issuer are each incorporated in Jersey. The United States and Jersey currently
do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards)
in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the
United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not
automatically be recognised or enforceable in Jersey. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Jersey, proceedings must
first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an action, a Jersey court would not generally
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be
possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defence to it). Recognition and
enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Jersey court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

      - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflicts of laws
principles;

      - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the
court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money (although there are circumstances where nonmoney judgments can also be enforced);

      - the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy;

      - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in
respect of a penalty or fine;

      - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying, a sum assessed as
compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of Section 5 of the United
Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to Jersey by the Protection of Trading Interests
Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983);

      - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of natural justice; and

      - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same matter.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial matters that
have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognised
or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a Jersey court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil
liability if the original action was commenced in Jersey, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal
securities laws.

**England and Wales**
The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in England and Wales is
based upon advice provided to us by our English legal advisors. The United States and the United Kingdom currently do not
have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil
and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment of a U.S. federal or state court in relation to the obligations of the
Issuer under the Note Trust Deed and the Class B2 Notes and of the Exchangeable Note Issuer under the Exchangeable Note
Trust Deed, the Subscription Agreement and the Exchangeable Notes will not be automatically enforceable in England and

332


-----

Wales, but a final and conclusive judgment for a debt or definite sum of money may be enforced at common law in England
and Wales provided that the party against whom the judgment was given properly submitted to the jurisdiction of the relevant
courts (in accordance with English rules on the conflict of laws), and none of the following circumstances applies:

      - the judgment was procured by fraud;

      - judgment was given contrary to the English rules of natural justice, for example the defendant was deprived of
notice of, or an adequate opportunity to take part in the proceedings, or substantial justice, in that the defendant
did not have the opportunity to correct procedural irregularities under the laws of the court giving judgment;

      - recognition of the judgment would be contrary to English public policy;

      - recognition of the judgment would violate the Human Rights Act 1998;

      - the judgment conflicts with an English judgment or a foreign judgment given earlier in time that is enforceable
in an English court;

      - the proceedings that resulted in the judgment were brought in breach of a binding arbitration agreement or a
contractual choice of court agreement;

      - enforcement of the judgment would involve the enforcement of a foreign penal (which involves payment to the
State as distinct from an individual) or revenue or other public law; or

      - enforcement of the judgment would contravene the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980, Section 5 of
which precludes, among other things, the enforcement in the United Kingdom of any judgment given by a
court of an overseas country which is a judgment for multiple damages which exceed the compensatory
element of the judgment award.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and commercial
matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be
enforceable in England and Wales.

In addition, an English court may decline to accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was
commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, and was predicated solely upon a law other than the law of
England and Wales.

**Listing**

Application will be made to the Irish Stock Exchange for the Class B2 Notes to be admitted to the Official List and
trading on the Global Exchange Market after the Mandatory Exchange. The Exchangeable Notes will not be listed or admitted
to trading on any exchange. The Issuer does not intend to provide to the public post-issuance transaction information
regarding the securities to be admitted to trading or the performance of the underlying assets. For so long as the Class B2
Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of that exchange require, physical copies of the following
documents may be inspected and obtained at the office of the Issuer at 47 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey JE1 OBD, during
normal business hours on any weekday:

      - the organisational documents of the Issuer;

Exchangeable Note Issuer Security to which it is a party.

**4.** **EXCHANGEABLE NOTE INTEREST**

**Period of accrual**

4.1 Each Exchangeable Note (or, in the case of the redemption of part only of an Exchangeable Note, that part only of
such Exchangeable Note) will cease to bear interest (if any) from (and including) the due date for redemption
unless, upon due presentation in accordance with Condition 6 (Payments), payment of the principal in respect of the
Exchangeable Note is improperly withheld or refused or default is otherwise made in respect of the payment, in
which event interest shall continue to accrue as provided in the Exchangeable Note Trust Deed.

**Exchangeable Note Interest Rate and Exchangeable Note Interest Payment Dates**

4.2 (a) The Exchangeable Notes shall bear interest on their respective Principal Amount Outstanding from (and
including) the Exchangeable Note Issue Date at % per annum ( the “Exchangeable Note Interest
**Rate”) only if (i) the Mandatory Exchange Event has not occurred by 12.00p.m. (London time) on**
30 November 2015 or (ii) the Exchangeable Notes are redeemed by the Exchangeable Note Issuer in
accordance with Condition 5.2 on or before 12.00p.m. (London time) on 30 November 2015. If the
Mandatory Exchange occurs on or before 12.00p.m. (London time) on 30 November 2015, the
Exchangeable Notes shall not bear any interest.

A-13


-----

(b) The period from and including the Exchangeable Note Issue Date to (but excluding) the Exchangeable
Note Interest Payment Date falling on 28 February 2016 is the “Exchangeable Note Interest Period”.

For the purposes of the foregoing if the Exchangeable Note Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day,
the Exchangeable Note Interest Payment Date will instead be the next Business Day in that calendar
month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).

**Calculation of Exchangeable Note Interest**

4.3 Any interest in respect of the Exchangeable Notes and interest payable in respect of any overdue amount of
principal shall be calculated as follows:

PAO x Rate x Actual

366

Where:

PAO is the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Exchangeable Notes or the aggregate amount of any
overdue amount of principal, as the case may be.

Rate is the applicable rate of interest.

Actual is the actual number of days in the period from (and including) the Exchangeable Note Issue Date to (but
excluding) the date on which the relevant payment falls due.

The resulting figure shall be rounded down to the nearest penny.

**5.** **REDEMPTION AND CANCELLATION**

**Final Redemption**

5.1 (a) Unless previously redeemed in full as provided in this Condition 5 (Redemption and Cancellation), the
Exchangeable Note Issuer shall redeem the Exchangeable Notes at their aggregate Principal Amount
Outstanding together with any accrued but unpaid interest and any Additional Amounts, if any, on the
Exchangeable Note Final Maturity Date.

(b) The Exchangeable Note Issuer may not redeem the Exchangeable Notes in whole or in part prior to the
Exchangeable Note Final Maturity Date except as provided below in Condition 5.2 (Optional Redemption

to endeavouring to take the reasonable measures available to it referred to below that by reason of a
change in tax laws or regulations (or the application or official interpretation thereof), which change
becomes effective on or after the Exchangeable Note Issue Date, on the next Exchangeable Note Interest
Payment Date, the Exchangeable Note Issuer would be required to deduct or withhold from any payment
of principal, interest or other amounts due and payable under the Exchangeable Notes, any amount for or
on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature
imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the United Kingdom or Jersey or any political subdivision thereof or any authority thereof or therein; then the Exchangeable Note Issuer shall, take
reasonable measures to avoid the effect of the event described above, (including, without limitation,
appointing a Paying Agent in another jurisdiction and/or using its reasonable endeavours to arrange the
substitution of a company incorporated and/or tax resident in another jurisdiction (approved in writing by
the Exchangeable Note Trustee) as principal debtor under the Exchangeable Notes) provided that the
Exchangeable Note Trustee is satisfied that taking such measures will not be materially prejudicial to the
interests of the Exchangeable Noteholders.

(b) If the Exchangeable Note Issuer certifies to the Exchangeable Note Trustee immediately before giving the
notice referred to below, that the event described in (a) above is continuing and that the effect of the
relevant event cannot be avoided by the Exchangeable Note Issuer taking reasonable measures available
to it, then the Exchangeable Note Issuer may, on any Exchangeable Note Interest Payment Date and

not some only) of the Exchangeable Notes on the Redemption Date at 100% of the aggregate issue price
of the Exchangeable Notes plus interest accrued but unpaid to the Redemption Date.

entity to whom the Exchangeable Notes are subsequently transferred may by notice to the Exchangeable Note Issuer
require redemption of the Exchangeable Notes on the date specified in such notice. On that date, the Exchangeable
Note Issuer shall redeem such Exchangeable Note at 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Exchangeable Notes.

**Principal Amount Outstanding**

5.5 (a) The Principal Amount Outstanding of an Exchangeable Note on any date shall be its original principal
amount less the amount of all principal payments, in respect of such Exchangeable Note which have been
paid since the Exchangeable Note Issue Date except if and to the extent that any such payment has been
improperly withheld or refused.

(b) Each determination by or on behalf of the Exchangeable Note Issuer of any Exchangeable Note principal
payment and the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of an Exchangeable Note shall in each case (in
the absence of wilful default, bad faith or manifest error) be final and binding on all persons. As soon as
practicable following a determination of an Exchangeable Note principal payment and/or the aggregate
Principal Amount Outstanding of an Exchangeable Note, the Exchangeable Note Issuer will cause such
determination of an Exchangeable Note principal payment and/or the aggregate Principal Amount
Outstanding of each Exchangeable Note to be notified to the Exchangeable Note Trustee, the

respect of any delay in payment resulting from the due date for a payment not being an Exchangeable Note Payment
Business Day.

**Initial Paying Agents and Exchangeable Note Registrar**

6.6 The names of the Principal Paying Agent and the Exchangeable Note Registrar and their respective initial specified
offices are set out at the end of these Conditions. The Exchangeable Note Issuer reserves the right, subject to the
prior written approval of the Exchangeable Note Trustee, at any time to vary or terminate the appointment of any
Paying Agent or the Exchangeable Note Registrar and to appoint additional or other Paying Agents or Exchangeable
Note Registrars (including in circumstances where the Principal Paying Agent, any Paying Agent or the
Exchangeable Note Registrar does not become, or ceases to be, a Participating FFI or otherwise exempt from
withholding or deduction of any Taxes (as that term is defined in Condition 8 below) in respect of FATCA at a time
when the Exchangeable Note Issuer would be required to withhold or deduct any amount from any payment made
by it to the Principal Paying Agent, any Paying Agent or the Exchangeable Note Registrar pursuant to FATCA)
provided that:

(a) there will at all times be a person appointed to perform the obligations of the Principal Paying Agent and
the Exchangeable Note Registrar;

A-16


-----

(b) so long as the Exchangeable Notes are listed on an exchange, there will at all times be at least one Paying
Agent (which may be the Principal Paying Agent) having its specified office in such place as may be
required by the rules and regulations of the relevant stock exchange and competent authority;

(c) the Exchangeable Note Issuer undertakes that it will ensure that it maintains a Paying Agent in a Member
State of the European Union that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to European
Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying
with, or introduced in order to conform to such Directive; and

(d) the Exchangeable Note Issuer will use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that at any time the
Exchangeable Note Issuer would otherwise be required to withhold tax on payments to the Principal
Paying Agent or any other Paying Agent pursuant to FATCA, the Principal Paying Agent and any other
Paying Agents are Participating FFIs or are otherwise exempt from withholding or deduction of any Taxes
(as that term is defined in Condition 8 below) in respect of FATCA.

6.7 Notice of any termination, variation or appointment and of any changes in specified offices will be given to the
Exchangeable Noteholders promptly by the Exchangeable Note Issuer in accordance with Condition 16 (Notice to
Exchangeable Noteholders).

**7.** **MANDATORY EXCHANGE**

7.1 The Exchangeable Notes will be exchangeable in whole (but not in part) for Class B2 Notes immediately following
Completion, upon issuance of the Class B2 Notes. On the occurrence of the Mandatory Exchange Event, the
Exchangeable Notes will be automatically exchanged, for an aggregate nominal amount of the Class B2 Notes equal
to the aggregate nominal amount of the Exchangeable Notes. The Issuer shall give notice to Euroclear, Clearstream
Luxembourg and the Principal Paying Agent on the day of the occurrence of a Mandatory Exchange Event.

7.2 On the occurrence of the Mandatory Exchange Event, each Exchangeable Noteholder shall and by its holding of
Exchangeable Notes hereby instructs the Clearing Systems to transfer each such Exchangeable Note held by it to the
Issuer, whereupon the Issuer shall transfer to each Noteholder a Class B2 Note in the same principal amount.

7.3 The Exchangeable Noteholders are deemed to have consented to the disclosure of their identity and contact details
by the Clearing Systems, the Principal Paying Agent and the Exchangeable Note Registrar for the purposes of
facilitating the Mandatory Exchange.

Registrar to take any steps necessary to give effect to, and reflect, the Mandatory Exchange without further
instruction from the Exchangeable Noteholders.

Issuer to redeem an aggregate principal amount of Exchangeable Notes equal to the balance standing to the credit of
the Escrow Agreement following completion of the Acquisition, which redemption shall be effected on the
Mandatory Exchange Date and (b) to transfer any Exchangeable Notes not so redeemed to one or more of the
Borrowers, at its discretion.

**8.** **TAXATION**

All payments in respect of the Exchangeable Notes by or on behalf of the Exchangeable Note Issuer shall be made without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of
whatever nature (“Taxes”), unless the withholding or deduction of the Taxes is required by applicable law. In such event, the
Exchangeable Note Issuer shall account to the relevant authorities for the amount required to be withheld or deducted. In such
event, the Exchangeable Note Issuer will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received by the Exchangeable Noteholders after the withholding or deduction shall equal the respective amounts which would
have been receivable in respect of the Exchangeable Notes in the absence of the withholding or deduction; provided that no
such additional amounts will be paid on account of:

(a) any Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any actual or deemed (pursuant to
applicable Tax law of the relevant Tax jurisdiction) present or former connection between the
Exchangeable Noteholder or the beneficial owner of the Exchangeable Notes (including, if applicable, a
connection between partners (in the case of a partnership) or shareholders (in the case of a corporation))
and the relevant Tax jurisdiction (including being a resident of such jurisdiction for Tax purposes), other
than holding of such Exchangeable Note, the enforcement of rights under such Exchangeable Note or the
receipt of any payments in respect of such Exchangeable Note;

A-17


-----

(b) any Taxes imposed as a result of the presentation of an Exchangeable Note for payment more than 30
days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Exchangeable Noteholder
(except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to additional amounts had the Exchangeable
Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, personal property, transfer or similar Taxes;

(d) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to an individual that are required to be made
pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC, or any law implementing or complying with or
introduced in order to conform to, such directive;

(e) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to an Exchangeable Noteholder or beneficial
owner of Exchangeable Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by
presenting the relevant Exchangeable Note to a Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(f) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to, the
Exchangeable Notes;

(g) any Taxes imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Exchangeable Noteholder or beneficial
owner of Exchangeable Notes, to comply with any reasonable written request of the Exchangeable Note
Issuer or the Paying Agent addressed to the Exchangeable Noteholders and made at least 30 days before
any such withholding or deduction would be payable to satisfy any certification, identification,
information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of a relevant Tax jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in
the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the relevant Tax jurisdiction (including,
without limitation, a certification that the Exchangeable Noteholder or beneficial owner is not resident in
the relevant Tax jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the Exchangeable Noteholder or
beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(h) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment to the Exchangeable Noteholder if such
Exchangeable Noteholder is a fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole beneficial owner of
such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had such
Exchangeable Noteholder been the sole beneficial owner of such Exchangeable Notes;

(i) any Taxes payable under FATCA; or

(j) any combination of items (a) through (i) above.

**9.** **PRESCRIPTION**

9.1 Claims in respect of principal and interest on the Exchangeable Notes will be prescribed after ten years (in the case
of principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the Relevant Date in respect of the relevant payment.

9.2 In this Condition 9 (Prescription), the “Relevant Date”, in respect of a payment, is the date on which such payment
first becomes due or (if the full amount of the monies payable on that date has not been duly received by the
Principal Paying Agent or the Exchangeable Note Trustee on or prior to such date) the date on which, the full
amount of such monies having been received, notice to that effect is duly given to the relevant Exchangeable
Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notice to Exchangeable Noteholders).

**10.** **EXCHANGEABLE NOTE EVENTS OF DEFAULT**

case of the Exchangeable Note Issuer Deed of Charge, the Exchangeable Note Issuer Security Trustee),
capable of remedy, but which remains unremedied for a period of 21 days following the giving of notice
by the Exchangeable Note Trustee (or the Exchangeable Note Issuer Security Trustee, as applicable) to
the Exchangeable Note Issuer requiring the same to be remedied and, in either case; provided that the
Exchangeable Note Trustee shall have determined that such event is, in its opinion, materially prejudicial
to the interests of the Exchangeable Noteholders; or

(d) an “Exchangeable Note Issuer Insolvency Event”; or

(e) it is or will become unlawful for the Exchangeable Note Issuer to perform or comply with its obligations

required to give a notice to the Exchangeable Note Issuer declaring the whole of the Exchangeable Note
Issuer Security to be enforceable.

**13.** **AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER**

13.1 The Exchangeable Note Trust Deed contains provisions for the Exchangeable Noteholders to consider any matter
affecting their interests, including any modification of these Conditions or the provisions of any of the
Exchangeable Note Transaction Documents (an “Exchangeable Note Voting Matter”), and the relevant voting
procedures and provisions. Any such Exchangeable Note Voting Matter may be put to the Exchangeable
Noteholders for their consideration by way of an “Exchangeable Note Voting Notice” given by the Exchangeable
Note Issuer or the Exchangeable Note Trustee to the Exchangeable Noteholders. Each Exchangeable Note Voting
Notice shall give at least five Business Days’ notice (exclusive of the day on which the notice is given and the day
on which voting is to occur (the “Exchangeable Note Voting Date”)) specifying the Exchangeable Note Voting
Date to the Exchangeable Noteholders. Such Exchangeable Note Voting Notice, which shall be in the English

subject to specified conditions, be treated as such, provided that, in the opinion of the Exchangeable Note Trustee,
the interests of the Exchangeable Noteholders would not be materially prejudiced thereby.

of the Paying Agent. Replacement of any mutilated, defaced, lost, stolen or destroyed Exchangeable Note will only
be made on payment of such costs, by the respective Exchangeable Noteholder, as may be incurred in connection
therewith and on such terms as to evidence and indemnity as the Exchangeable Note Issuer may reasonably require.
Mutilated or defaced Exchangeable Notes must be surrendered before new ones will be issued.

**16.** **NOTICE TO EXCHANGEABLE NOTEHOLDERS**

16.1 Any notice shall be deemed to have been duly given to the Exchangeable Noteholders if sent to the Clearing
Systems for communication by them to the holders of the Exchangeable Notes and shall be deemed to be given on
the date on which it was so sent and shall also be published in the following manner. In respect of Exchangeable
Definitive Notes, any notice to the Exchangeable Noteholders shall be validly given if published in a leading daily
newspaper printed in the English language and with general circulation in London (which is expected to be the
Financial Times) and (if and so long as the relevant Exchangeable Notes are admitted to trading on and listed on an
exchange), any notice shall also be published in accordance with the relevant listing rules and regulations.

16.2 Exchangeable Noteholders will be deemed for all purposes to have notice of the contents of any notice given to the
holders of Exchangeable Notes in accordance with this Condition 16 (Notice to Exchangeable Noteholders).

**17.** **EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION**

**Notice of redenomination**

17.1 The Exchangeable Note Issuer may, without the consent of the Exchangeable Noteholders, and on giving at least 30
days’ prior notice to the Exchangeable Noteholders, the Exchangeable Note Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent,
designate a date (the “Redenomination Date”), being an Exchangeable Note Interest Payment Date falling on or
after the date on which the UK becomes a Member State.

**Redenomination**

17.2 Notwithstanding the other provisions of these Conditions, with effect from the Redenomination Date:

(a) the Exchangeable Notes denominated in sterling (the “Exchangeable Sterling Notes”) shall be deemed to
be redenominated into euro in the denomination of €0.01 with a principal amount for each Exchangeable
Note equal to the principal amount of that Exchangeable Note in sterling, converted into euro at the rate
for conversion of such currency into euro established by the Council of the European Union pursuant to

A-21


-----

the Treaty establishing the European Union, as amended (including compliance with rules relating to
rounding in accordance with European Community regulations), provided, however, that, if the
Exchangeable Note Issuer determines, that the then current market practice in respect of the
redenomination into €0.01 of internationally offered securities is different from that specified above, such
provisions shall be deemed to be amended so as to comply with such market practice and the
Exchangeable Note Issuer shall promptly notify the Exchangeable Noteholders, any stock exchange on
which the Exchangeable Notes are then listed and the Principal Paying Agent of such deemed
amendments;

(b) if Exchangeable Notes have been issued in definitive form:

(i) all Exchangeable Notes denominated in sterling will become void with effect from the date (the
“Euro Exchange Date”) on which the Exchangeable Note Issuer gives notice (the “Euro
**Exchange Notice”) to the Exchangeable Noteholders and the Exchangeable Note Trustee that**
replacement Exchangeable Notes denominated in euro are available for exchange (provided that
such Exchangeable Notes are available) and no payments will be made in respect thereof;

(ii) the payment obligations contained in all Exchangeable Notes denominated in sterling will
become void on the Euro Exchange Date but all other obligations of the Exchangeable Note
Issuer thereunder (including the obligation to exchange such Exchangeable Notes in accordance
with this Condition 17 (European Economic and Monetary Union)) shall remain in full force
and effect; and

(iii) new Exchangeable Notes denominated in euro will be issued in exchange for Exchangeable
Sterling Notes in such manner as the Exchangeable Note Issuer may specify and as shall be
notified to the Exchangeable Noteholders in the Euro Exchange Notice;

(c) all payments in respect of the Exchangeable Sterling Notes will be made solely in euro by credit or
transfer to a euro account (or any other account to which euro may be credited or transferred) maintained
by the payee with a bank in the principal financial centre of any Member State; and

(d) an Exchangeable Note may only be presented for payment on a day which is a business day in the place of
presentation.

**Interest**

17.3 Following redenomination of the Exchangeable Notes pursuant to this Condition 17 (European Economic and
Monetary Union where Exchangeable Sterling Notes have been issued in definitive form, the amount of interest due
in respect of the Exchangeable Sterling Notes will be calculated by reference to the aggregate principal amount of
the Exchangeable Sterling Notes presented for payment by the relevant holder and the amount of such payment
shall be rounded down to the nearest €0.01.

**18.** **RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES**

No rights are conferred under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of the Exchangeable Notes
or these Conditions, but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party which exists or is available apart from the
Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

**20.** **GOVERNING LAW**

Each of the Exchangeable Note Transaction Documents, the Exchangeable Global Notes and these Conditions (and, in each
case, any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the relevant document) are governed by, and shall
be construed in accordance with, English law.

**20.** **JURISDICTION**

The courts of England are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute including any dispute as to any non-contractual
obligations that may arise out of or in connection with the Exchangeable Notes and the Exchangeable Note Transaction
Documents (save to the extent governed by Jersey law) to which the Exchangeable Note Issuer is party and, accordingly, any
legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Exchangeable Notes and/or the Exchangeable Note
Transaction Documents may be brought in such courts. The Exchangeable Note Issuer has in each of the Exchangeable Note
Transaction Documents to which it is a party irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts.

European Union and, as regards the Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act 2006.

In applying the financial reporting framework, the Directors have made a number of subjective judgments, for example in
respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future
events.

**Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

**Other matters on which we are required to report by exception**

_Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received_

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

 - We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

 - Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

 - The financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

_Directors’ remuneration_

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF
CENTER PARCS (HOLDINGS 1) LIMITED—(CONTINUED)

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

_Our responsibilities and those of the Directors_

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of the financial statements set out on page 7,
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view.

Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”. Those standards require us to comply with the
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

_What an audit of financial statements involves_

We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:

 - Whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group and Company’s circumstances and have been consistently
applied and adequately disclosed;

 - The reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors;

 - The overall presentation of the financial statements.

We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.

We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls,
substantive procedures or a combination of both.

In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and financial statements to identify
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

company income statement. The loss for the parent company for the period was £11.1 million (2014: loss of £11.1 million).

All amounts relate to continuing activities.

Cost of sales and Administrative expenses have been restated for the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2014 in order to more
accurately reflect the nature of expenses incurred by the Group. Total costs of £53.0 million have been transferred from
Administrative expenses to Cost of sales, principally in respect of payroll costs. This restatement has no impact on Adjusted
EBITDA or operating profit.

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

**1.** **Accounting policies**

**General information**

The Company is a limited company, which is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered
office is One Edison Rise, New Ollerton, Newark, Nottinghamshire, NG22 9DP.

**Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2015 (2014: 52 weeks ended 24 April
2014) have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC) and Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) interpretations adopted by the European Union and with
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements
have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial
instruments and retirement benefit obligations. All accounting policies disclosed have been applied consistently to
both periods presented.

The accounting reference date of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited is 22 April.

**Going concern**

The Directors have assessed the financial positions of the Group and the Company in light of the net current
liabilities positions at the end of the period. In assessing the going concern of the business they have considered the
projected future trading and cash flows of the business. Using the evidence available to them they have concluded
that it is appropriate to present the financial statements on a going concern basis, as they consider that the Group
will continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements.

**Basis of consolidation**

On 28 February 2012 Center Parcs effected a corporate reorganisation under which Forest Holdco Limited and its
subsidiary undertakings and CP Comet Holdings Limited and its subsidiary undertakings were combined into a
single consolidated group headed by Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited. Before and after this reorganisation the
entities were all under common control and hence the business combination was outside the scope of IFRS 3
‘Business Combinations (revised)’.

The consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited have been prepared under the principles
of predecessor accounting, whereby an acquirer is not required to be identified, and all entities are included at their
pre-combination carrying amounts. This accounting treatment results in differences on consolidation between
consideration and the fair value of underlying net assets and this difference is included within equity as an other
reserve.

An investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the
investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of CPUK Finance Limited, a company set up with the
sole purpose of issuing debt secured on assets owned by the Group. The Directors of Center Parcs (Holdings 1)
Limited consider this company meets the definition of a structured entity under IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial
statements’ and hence for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements it has been treated as a subsidiary
undertaking. Details of this company are provided in note 26.

**Key assumptions and significant judgements**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates are principally used in the
following areas:

_Property, plant and equipment: Useful lives of assets and residual values (see accounting policy)_

_Impairment test for goodwill: Growth and discount rates (note 6)_

_Other intangible assets: Useful lives of assets and residual values (see accounting policy)_

_Retirement benefits: Actuarial assumptions in respect of the defined benefit scheme (note 22)_

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

**Revenue**

Revenue relates to villa rental income on holidays commenced during the period, together with other related income
that primarily arises from on-village leisure, retail and food and beverage spend. Non-rental income is recognised
when the related product or service is provided. All revenue is recorded net of VAT.

Payment for villa rental income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded as ‘payments on
account’ within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences.

A number of trading units on each holiday village are operated by concession partners. Revenue due in respect of
such units is recognised on a periodic basis as it is invoiced to the concession partner.

All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.

**Cost of sales**

Cost of sales comprise the cost of goods and services provided to guests. All costs to the point of sale, including
direct employee costs, are included within cost of sales.

**Operating segments**

The operating segments set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements are consistent with the internal
reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. The Chief
Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.

**Exceptional/non-underlying items**

Exceptional/non-underlying items are defined as those that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency,
warrant separate disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of
the Group. Non-underlying items are those that are not directly related to the ongoing trade of the business or that
are unrepresentative of ongoing performance.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is instead
tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is
allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.

**Other intangible assets**

_Software_

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the
specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is generally considered to be
four years.

Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the
Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as
intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of
relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated
useful lives, which do not exceed four years.

_Other purchased intangible assets_

Other purchased intangible assets are capitalised at cost and are amortised over their useful economic lives. The
Group’s water boreholes are amortised on a straight-line basis over 13 years. The brand is not amortised as it is
considered to have an indefinite life.

The water boreholes were transferred to property, plant and equipment during the period to better reflect the nature
of the assets.

**Impairment of assets**

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances

F-10

FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at
the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).

**Property, plant and equipment**

Management chose the cost basis under IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’, rather than to apply the alternative
(revaluation) treatment to all items of property, plant and equipment as its ongoing accounting policy. The cost of
property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable costs. The Group elected to apply the optional
exemption of IFRS 1 ‘First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ and, as such, the carrying
value of properties that were previously held at fair value was treated as deemed cost at the date of adoption of
IFRS.

Depreciation is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment (except assets in the course of
construction), so as to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful
economic life of the assets concerned, using the following rates:

Installations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.67%

Fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14%

Motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25%

Computer hardware . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25%

Buildings are depreciated to residual value over 50 years. Land is not depreciated.

Useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and revised where expectations are
significantly different from previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for current and future periods
is adjusted accordingly.

**Maintenance expenditure**

It is the policy of the Group to maintain its land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance expenditure
increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to generate, this expenditure is capitalised. All
other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

**Leases**

Leases are classified as finance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at cost and depreciated over their useful lives. The capital element
of future rentals is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged to the income statement over the period
of the lease in proportion to the capital outstanding.

Rental payments on operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor and including minimum
contractual rental increases) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.

**Investments in subsidiary undertakings**

Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for permanent diminution in value. If there are indications of
impairment, an assessment is made of the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income
statement when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value.

Dividends receivable from investments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised in the income statement when
approved by the shareholders of the company paying the dividend.

**Current and deferred tax**

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed
by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are
defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred tax on
properties assumes recovery through sale.

F-11


-----

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or
the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Inventories**

The basis of valuation of inventories is the lower of cost on a first in first out basis and estimated net realisable
value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable
selling expenses. Inventory provisions are created where necessary to ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of
cost and estimated net realisable value.

**Financial instruments**

The Group classifies its financial assets into two categories, being fair value through profit and loss, and loans and
receivables. Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial liabilities.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired. Management
determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at
each reporting date.

Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade
and other receivables in the balance sheet.

**Investments**

The cost of investments, including loans to related parties, is their purchase cost together with any incremental costs
of acquisition. The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In deciding whether an impairment is required, the Directors
consider the underlying value inherent in the investment. Provision is made against the cost of investments where,
in the opinion of the Directors, there is an impairment in the value of the individual investment.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made
when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original
terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank
and cash in hand.

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Interest on borrowings is treated as an expense in the income statement, with the exception of interest costs incurred
on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.

F-12

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

**Early termination costs**

Costs associated with the early repayment of borrowings are written off to the income statement as incurred.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments have historically been
used by the Group to manage its exposure to interest rates on long-term floating-rate borrowings. All derivative
financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value. The Group does not currently hedge
account for any derivatives. As such, any gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the income statement.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

**Government grants**

Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are categorised as accruals on receipt and are credited to the
income statement over the useful life of the relevant property, plant and equipment. The government grant included
in the balance sheet at the period end represents grants received to date, less the amount so far credited to the
income statement.

**Provisions**

Provisions for legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result
of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is
determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an
outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations is small.

**Dividend distribution**

Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.

**Foreign currencies**

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. The resulting profit or loss, together with realised profits and losses arising during
the period on the settlement of overseas assets and liabilities, are included in the trading results. Transactions
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the
transaction.

**Employee benefits**

_Pensions_

—Defined contribution pension scheme

Group employees can choose to be a member of a defined contribution pension scheme. A defined contribution
pension scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The
Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets
to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions are
charged to the income statement as incurred.

—Defined benefit pension scheme

A funded senior management defined benefit pension scheme also exists. A defined benefit pension scheme is a
pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

F-13


-----

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

The surplus or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together
with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates for
high-quality corporate bonds, which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.

Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Remeasurement gains and losses are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

_Profit-sharing and bonus plans_

The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into
consideration the profit attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises
a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

_Holiday pay_

The Group recognises an appropriate liability for the cost of holiday entitlements not taken at the balance sheet date.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds.

**Other reserve**

The other reserve in the consolidated financial statements represents the differences on consolidation arising on the
adoption of predecessor accounting. This comprises the difference between consideration paid and the book value of
net assets acquired in the transaction.

The other reserve in the Company financial statements represents the application of group reconstruction relief in
accordance with section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, following the acquisition of certain subsidiaries in prior
periods from fellow group companies.

**New standards and interpretations**

The following new accounting standards and interpretations are effective for the first time in the current period:

 - A revision to IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ in respect of investment entities.

 - A revision to IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’ in respect of investment entities.

 - A revision to IAS 27 ‘Separate financial statements’ in respect of investment entities.

 - A revision to IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’ in respect of offsetting assets and liabilities.

 - IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’

These have not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group and Company and are unlikely to
have a material impact in the future.

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and IFRIC have issued the following new or revised
standards and interpretations with an effective date for financial periods beginning on or after the dates disclosed

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating
Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the
Board of Directors.

The operating segments are the four holiday villages that the business operates. In addition there are certain
centralised administrative costs that cannot be allocated directly to an operating segment.

The primary profit measure used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker is Adjusted EBITDA, being earnings
before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation, exceptional/non-underlying items and owners’ costs (those
costs payable to The Blackstone Group and associated entities).

The internal reporting does not disaggregate the balance sheet to each operating segment.

The split of revenue by business stream was £186.8 million (2014: £186.0 million) for accommodation and
£132.8 million (2014: £128.6 million) for on-site spend. The split of gross profit was £169.2 million (2014:
£169.2 million) for accommodation and £63.9 million (2014: £61.1 million) for on-site spend.

Exceptional/non-underlying administrative expenses are costs incurred in respect of the Group’s ongoing review of
its strategic options.

The Directors consider that the economic characteristics and future expectations are materially consistent across
each of the villages within each revenue stream.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash
flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a one year period. Cash flows
beyond the one year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

**Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations**

The key assumptions of the value-in-use calculation are EBITDA margin, perpetual growth rate and discount rate
for each of on-site and accommodation. The long-term growth rate used is 2.5% (2014: 2.5%) in respect of both
accommodation and on-site. The discount rate used is 7.73% (2014: 7.73%) in respect of both accommodation and
on-site.

Management determine budgeted EBITDA margins based on past performance and expectations of market
development. The growth rates used reflect management’s expectations of the future market. Discount rates used
are pre-tax and reflect the specific risks to the Group.

Based on the value-in-use calculations performed, the Directors have concluded that there is no impairment of
goodwill. The Directors have performed sensitivity analysis using the full range of reasonable assumptions and no
impairment triggers have been identified.

The Company has no goodwill.

The Company has no other intangible assets.

The Group has a mortgage secured over its head office which incurs interest at LIBOR plus 1.125% and matures in
2020. Annual repayments on this mortgage total £267,000. A one percentage point movement in interest rates
would affect this interest charge by approximately £14,000 (2014: £17,000).

The securitised debt consists of the following:

**1,001.5** 993.9

The securitised debt represents a £1,020.0 million facility made available to the Group. The total facility was drawn
down on 28 February 2012.

The tranche A1 notes had an expected maturity date of 28 February 2017 and a final maturity date of 28 February
2042. The interest rate to expected maturity was fixed at 4.811% and the interest rate from expected maturity to
final maturity was fixed at 7.169%.

The tranche A2 notes have an expected maturity date of 28 February 2024 and a final maturity date of 28 February
2042. The interest rate to expected maturity is fixed at 7.239% and the interest rate from expected maturity to final
maturity is fixed at 7.919%.

The tranche B notes have an expected maturity date of 28 February 2018 and a final maturity date of 28 February
2042. The interest rate to 28 February 2020 is fixed at 11.625% and the interest rate from 29 February 2020 to final
maturity is fixed at 6.25%.

The tranche A1 notes were repaid, at the option of the Group, shortly after the financial year-end as set out in
note 27; unamortised deferred issue costs relating to this tranche of the securitised debt of £4.3 million have been
amortised on an accelerated basis to reflect this repayment profile. This accelerated amortisation has been classified
as an exceptional/non-underlying finance expense in the income statement.

The tranche B debt is subordinated to the tranche A debt. Both include optional prepayment clauses permitting the Group
to repay the debt in advance of the expected maturity date. All tranches of debt are subject to financial covenants. The
Directors have assessed future compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial covenants.

The option to repay the B debt prior to maturity is considered to be a derivative financial instrument with a fair
value of £16.8 million (2014: £nil), such fair value being estimated with reference to the yields of similar corporate
bonds with comparable terms and credit ratings. The movement in the fair value has been recognised as an
exceptional/non-underlying item in the income statement.

hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable
inputs).

The Company has no non-current financial liabilities.

**Financial risk management**

The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity and borrowings as required. The Group has sought to
reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Group’s funding using the underlying asset value.

All tranches of the Group’s secured debt are subject to financial covenants. The Directors have assessed future
compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial covenants.

The overall policy in respect of interest rates is to reduce the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and the
Group’s primary source of borrowings is fixed interest rate loan notes.

The Group does not actively trade in derivative financial instruments.

**Interest rate risk**

The Group has a floating rate mortgage and fixed rate loan notes as its only external funding sources. As at 23 April
2015, 99% (24 April 2014: 99%) of the Group’s external financial borrowings incurred interest at a fixed rate.

**Liquidity risk**

As at 23 April 2015, the Group held sufficient levels of cash to enable it to meet its medium-term working capital
and funding obligations. Rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements are prepared and monitored, and
surplus cash is invested in interest bearing accounts.

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes and assessment of:

    - whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group and Company’s circumstances and have been
consistently applied and adequately disclosed;

    - the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors;

    - the overall presentation of the financial statements.

In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and financial statements (the
“Annual Report”) to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the
implications for our report.

**Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion, the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 24 APRIL 2014

**1.** **Accounting policies**

**General information**

The Company is a limited company, which is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered
office is One Edison Rise, New Ollerton, Newark, Nottinghamshire, NG22 9DP.

**Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2014 (2013: 52 weeks ended 25 April
2013) have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC) and Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) interpretations adopted by the European Union and with
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements
have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial
instruments and retirement benefit obligations. All accounting policies are consistent with the prior period.

The financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited are typically drawn up to the Thursday nearest to its
accounting reference date of 22 April.

**Going concern**

The Directors have assessed the financial position of the Group in light of the net current liabilities position at the
end of the period. In assessing the going concern of the business they have considered the projected future trading
and cash flows of the business. Using the evidence available to them they have concluded that it is appropriate to
present the financial statements on a going concern basis, as they consider that the Group will continue as a going
concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements.

**Basis of consolidation**

On 28 February 2012 Center Parcs effected a corporate reorganisation under which Forest Holdco Limited and its
subsidiary undertakings and CP Comet Holdings Limited and its subsidiary undertakings were combined into a
single consolidated group headed by Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited. Before and after this reorganisation the
entities were all under common control and hence the business combination was outside the scope of IFRS 3
‘Business Combinations (revised)’.

The consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited have been prepared under the principles
of predecessor accounting, whereby an acquirer is not required to be identified, and all entities are included at their
pre-combination carrying amounts. This accounting treatment results in differences on consolidation between
consideration and the fair value of underlying net assets and this difference is included within equity as an other
reserve.

Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the
financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of CPUK Finance Limited, a company set up with the
sole purpose of issuing debt secured on assets owned by the Group. The Directors of Center Parcs (Holdings 1)
Limited consider this company meets the definition of a special purpose entity under SIC 12 ‘Consolidation—
Special Purpose Entities’ and hence for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements it has been treated as a
subsidiary undertaking. Details of this company are provided in note 26.

**Key assumptions and significant judgements**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates are principally used in the
following areas:

_Property, plant and equipment: Useful lives of assets and residual values (see accounting policy)_

_Impairment test for goodwill: Growth and discount rates (note 6)_

_Other intangible assets: Useful lives of assets and residual values (see accounting policy)_

_Retirement benefits: Actuarial assumptions in respect of the defined benefit scheme (note 22)_

**Revenue**

Revenue relates to villa rental income on holidays commenced during the period, together with other related income
that primarily arises from on-village leisure, retail and food and beverage spend. Non-rental income is recognised
when the related product or service is provided. All revenue is recorded net of VAT.

Payment for villa rental income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded as ‘payments on
account’ within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences.

A number of trading units on each holiday village are operated by concession partners. Revenue due in respect of
such units is recognised on a receivables basis.

All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.

**Operating segments**

The operating segments set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements are consistent with the internal
reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. The Chief
Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are defined as those that, by virtue of their nature, size or expect frequency, warrant separate
disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the Group.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is instead
tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is
allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.

**Other intangible assets**

_Software_

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the
specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is generally considered to be
four years.

Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as
incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products
controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are
recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate
portion of relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their
estimated useful lives, which do not exceed four years.

_Other purchased intangible assets_

Other purchased intangible assets are capitalised at cost and are amortised over their useful economic lives. The
Group’s water boreholes are amortised on a straight-line basis over 13 years. The brand is not amortised as it is
considered to have an indefinite life.

**Impairment of assets**

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at
the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).

FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 24 APRIL 2014

**Property, plant and equipment**

Management chose the cost basis under IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’, rather than to apply the alternative
(revaluation) treatment to all items of property, plant and equipment as its ongoing accounting policy. The cost of
property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable costs. The Group elected to apply the optional
exemption of IFRS 1 ‘First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ and, as such, the carrying
value of properties that were previously held at fair value was treated as deemed cost at the date of adoption of
IFRS.

Depreciation is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment (except assets in the course of
construction), so as to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful
economic life of the assets concerned, using the following rates:

Installations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.67%

Fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14%

Motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25%

Computer hardware . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25%

Buildings are depreciated to residual value over 50 years. Land is not depreciated.

Useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and revised where expectations are
significantly different from previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for current and future periods
is adjusted accordingly.

**Maintenance expenditure**

It is the policy of the Group to maintain its land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance expenditure
increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to generate, this expenditure is capitalised. All
other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

**Leases**

Leases are classified as finance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at cost and depreciated over their useful lives. The capital element
of future rentals is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged to the income statement over the period
of the lease in proportion to the capital outstanding.

Rental payments on operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor and including minimum
contractual rental increases) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.

**Investments in subsidiary undertakings**

Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for permanent diminution in value. If there are indications of
impairment, an assessment is made of the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income
statement when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value.

Dividends receivable from investments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised in the income statement when
approved by the shareholders of the company paying the dividend.

**Current and deferred tax**

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed
by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are
defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred tax on
properties assumes recovery through sale.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the assets can be utilised.

F-43


-----

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 24 APRIL 2014

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or
the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Inventories**

The basis of valuation of inventories is the lower of cost on a first in first out basis and estimated net realisable
value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable
selling expenses. Inventory provisions are created where necessary to ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of
cost and estimated net realisable value.

**Financial instruments**

The Group classifies its financial assets into two categories, being fair value through profit and loss, and loans and
receivables. Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial liabilities.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired. Management
determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at
each reporting date.

Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade
and other receivables in the balance sheet.

**Financial assets**

The cost of investments, including loans to related parties, is their purchase cost together with any incremental costs
of acquisition. The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In deciding whether an impairment is required, the Directors
consider the underlying value inherent in the investment. Provision is made against the cost of investments where,
in the opinion of the Directors, there is an impairment in the value of the individual investment.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made
when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original
terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank
and cash in hand.

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Interest on borrowings is treated as an expense in the income statement, with the exception of interest costs incurred
on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 24 APRIL 2014

**Early termination costs**

Costs associated with the early repayment of borrowings are written off to the income statement as incurred.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments have historically been
used by the Group to manage its exposure to interest rates on long-term floating-rate borrowings. All derivative
financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value. The Group does not currently hedge
account for any derivatives. As such, any gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the income statement.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

**Government grants**

Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are categorised as accruals on receipt and are credited to the
income statement over the useful life of the relevant property, plant and equipment. The government grant included
in the balance sheet at the period end represents grants received to date, less the amount so far credited to the
income statement.

**Provisions**

Provisions for legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result
of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is
determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an
outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations is small.

**Dividend distribution**

Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.

**Foreign currencies**

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. The resulting profit or loss, together with realised profits and losses arising during
the period on the settlement of overseas assets and liabilities, are included in the trading results.

**Employee benefits**

_Pensions_

—Defined contribution pension scheme

Group employees can choose to be a member of a defined contribution pension scheme. A defined contribution
pension scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The
Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets
to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions are
charged to the income statement as incurred.

—Defined benefit pension scheme

A funded senior management defined benefit pension scheme also exists. A defined benefit pension scheme is a
pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

F-45


-----

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 24 APRIL 2014

The surplus or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together
with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates for
high-quality corporate bonds, which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.

Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Remeasurement gains and losses are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

_Profit-sharing and bonus plans_

The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into
consideration the profit attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises
a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

_Holiday pay_

The Group recognises an appropriate liability for the cost of holiday entitlements not taken at the balance sheet date.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

**Other reserve**

The other reserve in the consolidated financial statements represents the differences on consolidation arising on the
adoption of predecessor accounting. This comprises the difference between consideration paid and the book value of
net assets acquired in the transaction.

The other reserve in the Company financial statements represents the application of group reconstruction relief in
accordance with section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, following the acquisition of certain subsidiaries in prior
periods from fellow group companies.

**New standards and interpretations**

The only new accounting standards or interpretations effective in the current period are a revision to IAS 1
‘Presentation of financial statements’ in respect of the presentation of other comprehensive income, a revision to
IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ in respect of the measurement of termination benefits and a new accounting standard
IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’, setting out a framework for measuring fair value and required disclosures. These
have not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group and Company and are unlikely to have a
material impact in the future.

The audited consolidated financial statements for the period ended 25 April 2013 have not been restated for the
adoption of IAS 19 revised as the impact is not significant to the result or financial position.

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and IFRIC have issued the following new or revised
standards and interpretations with an effective date for financial periods beginning on or after the dates disclosed
below and therefore after the date of these financial statements. The IASB has also issued a number of minor
amendments to standards as part of their annual improvement process.

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating
Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the
Board of Directors.

The operating segments are the four holiday villages that the business operates. In addition there are certain
centralised administrative costs that cannot be allocated directly to an operating segment.

The primary profit measure used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker is Adjusted EBITDA, being earnings
before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation, exceptional items and owners’ costs (those costs payable to The
Blackstone Group and associated entities).

The internal reporting does not disaggregate the balance sheet to each operating segment.

The split of revenue was £186.0 million (2013: £179.3 million) for accommodation and £128.6 million (2013:
£124.2 million) for on-site spend.

The March 2013 Budget included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% with
effect from 1 April 2014 and to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. This legislation was substantively enacted for
financial reporting purposes on 2 July 2013 and hence has been reflected in these financial statements.

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 24 APRIL 2014

The Directors consider that the economic characteristics and future expectations are materially consistent across
each of the villages within each revenue stream.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash
flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a one year period. Cash flows
beyond the one year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.

**Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations**

The key assumptions of the value-in-use calculation are EBITDA margin, perpetual growth rate and discount rate
for each of on-site and accommodation. The growth rate used is 2.5% (2013: 2.5%) in respect of both
accommodation and on-site. The discount rate used is 7.73% (2013: 7.73%) in respect of both accommodation and
on-site.

Management determine budgeted EBITDA margins based on past performance and expectations of market
development. The growth rates used reflect management’s expectations of the future market. Discount rates used
are pre-tax and reflect the specific risks to the Group.

Based on the value-in-use calculations performed, the Directors have concluded that there is no impairment of
goodwill. The Directors have performed sensitivity analysis using the full range of reasonable assumptions and no
impairment triggers have been identified.

The Company has no goodwill.

The investment at 24 April 2014 relates to 100% of the ordinary shares of Center Parcs (Holdings 2) Limited, a

**Fair value hierarchy**

IFRS 13 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value
hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable
inputs).

The Company has no non-current financial liabilities.

**Financial risk management**

The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity and borrowings as required. The Group has sought to
reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Group’s funding using the underlying asset value.

The overall policy in respect of interest rates is to reduce the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and the
Group’s primary source of borrowings is fixed interest rate loan notes.

The Group does not actively trade in derivative financial instruments.

**Interest rate risk**

The Group has a floating rate mortgage and fixed rate loan notes as its only external funding sources. As at 24 April
2014, 99% (25 April 2013: 99%) of the Group’s external financial borrowings incurred interest at a fixed rate.

**Liquidity risk**

As at 24 April 2014, the Group held sufficient levels of cash to enable it to meet its medium-term working capital
and funding obligations. Rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements are prepared and monitored, and
surplus cash is invested in interest bearing accounts.

**Currency risk**

The Group is exposed to limited currency risk through foreign currency transactions. The Group does not operate a
hedging facility to manage currency risk as it is considered to be insignificant.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF
CENTER PARCS (HOLDINGS 1) LIMITED

**Independent auditors’ report to the members of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited**

We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements (“the financial statements”) of Center Parcs (Holdings 1)
Limited for the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2013 which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of
Comprehensive Income, the Group and Company Balance Sheets, the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Group and Company
Statements of Changes in Equity and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union, and
as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.

**Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors**

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 5, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

**Scope of the audit of the financial statements**

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and parent company’s
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial
and non-financial information in the annual report and financial statements to identify material inconsistencies with the
audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the
implications for our report.

**Opinion on financial statements**

In our opinion:

 - the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and parent company’s affairs as at 25 April
2013 and of the Group’s profit and the Group’s and parent company’s cash flows for the period then ended;

 - the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union;

 - the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and

 - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

**Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial period for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in
our opinion:

 - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

 - the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

 - certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

 - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 APRIL 2013

**1.** **Accounting policies**

**General information**

The Company is a limited company, which is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered
office is One Edison Rise, New Ollerton, Newark, Nottinghamshire, NG22 9DP.

**Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2013 (2012: 52 weeks ended 26 April
2012) have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC) and Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) interpretations adopted by the European Union and with
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements
have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial
instruments and retirement benefit obligations. All accounting policies are consistent with the prior period.

The financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited are typically drawn up to the Thursday nearest to its
accounting reference date of 22 April.

**Going concern**

The Directors have assessed the financial position of the Group in light of the net current liabilities position at the
end of the period. In assessing the going concern of the business they have considered the projected future trading
and cash flows of the business. Using the evidence available to them they have concluded that it is appropriate to
present the financial statements on a going concern basis, as they consider that the Group will continue as a going
concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements.

**Basis of consolidation**

On 28 February 2012 Center Parcs effected a corporate reorganisation under which Forest Holdco Limited and its
subsidiary undertakings and CP Comet Holdings Limited and its subsidiary undertakings were combined into a
single consolidated group headed by Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited. Before and after this reorganisation the
entities were all under common control and hence the business combination was outside the scope of IFRS 3
‘Business Combinations (revised)’.

The consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited have been prepared under the principles
of predecessor accounting, whereby an acquirer is not required to be identified, and all entities are included at their
pre-combination carrying amounts. This accounting treatment results in differences on consolidation between
consideration and the fair value of underlying net assets and this difference is included within equity as an other
reserve.

Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the
financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of CPUK Finance Limited, a company set up with the
sole purpose of issuing debt secured on assets owned by the Group. The Directors of Center Parcs (Holdings 1)
Limited consider this company meets the definition of a special purpose entity under SIC 12 ‘Consolidation—
Special Purpose Entities’ and hence for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements it has been treated as a
subsidiary undertaking. Details of this company are provided in note 30.

**Key assumptions and significant judgements**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates are principally used in the
following areas:

_Property, plant and equipment:_ Useful lives of assets and residual values (see accounting policy)

_Impairment test for goodwill:_ Growth and discount rates (note 8)

_Other intangible assets:_ Useful lives of assets and residual values (see accounting policy)

_Retirement benefits:_ Actuarial assumptions in respect of the defined benefit scheme (note 26)

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 APRIL 2013

**Revenue**

Revenue relates to villa rental income on holidays commenced during the period, together with other related income
that primarily arises from on-village leisure, retail and food and beverage spend. Non-rental income is recognised
when the related product or service is provided. All revenue is recorded net of VAT.

Payment for villa rental income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded as ‘payments on
account’ within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences.

A number of trading units on each holiday village are operated by concession partners. Revenue due in respect of
such units is recognised on a receivables basis.

All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.

**Operating segments**

The operating segments set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements are consistent with the internal
reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. The Chief
Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are defined as those that, by virtue of their nature, size or expect frequency, warrant separate
disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the Group.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is instead
tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is
allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.

**Other intangible assets**

_Software_

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the
specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is generally considered to be
four years.

Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as
incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products
controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are
recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate
portion of relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their
estimated useful lives, which do not exceed four years.

_Other purchased intangible assets_

Other purchased intangible assets, including patents, know-how, trademarks, licences and distribution rights, are
capitalised at cost and are amortised over their useful economic lives using the following rates:

Advance bookings the period to which the bookings relate
Repeat business over a four year period
Water boreholes straight-line basis over 13 years

The brand is not amortised as it is considered to have an indefinite life.

**Impairment of assets**

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. Where required, assets are discounted using an AAA corporate
bond rate. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).

**Property, plant and equipment**

Management chose the cost basis under IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’, rather than to apply the alternative
(revaluation) treatment to all items of property, plant and equipment as its ongoing accounting policy. The cost of
property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable costs. The Group elected to apply the optional
exemption of IFRS 1 ‘First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ and, as such, the carrying
value of properties that were previously held at fair value was treated as deemed cost at the date of adoption of
IFRS.

Depreciation is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment (except assets in the course of
construction), so as to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful
economic life of the assets concerned, using the following rates:

Installations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.67%

Buildings are depreciated to residual value over 50 years. Land is not depreciated.

Useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and revised where expectations are
significantly different from previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for current and future periods
is adjusted accordingly.

**Maintenance expenditure**

It is the policy of the Group to maintain its land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance expenditure
increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to generate, this expenditure is capitalised. All
other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

**Leases**

Leases are classified as finance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at cost and depreciated over their useful lives. The capital element
of future rentals is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged to the income statement over the period
of the lease in proportion to the capital outstanding.

Rental payments on operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor and including minimum
contractual rental increases) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.

**Investments in subsidiary undertakings**

Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for permanent diminution in value. If there are indications of
impairment, an assessment is made of the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income
statement when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value.

Dividends receivable from investments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised in the income statement when
approved by the shareholders of the company paying the dividend.

**Current and deferred tax**

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed
by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are
defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred tax on
properties assumes recovery through sale.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or
the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 APRIL 2013

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Inventories**

The basis of valuation of inventories is the lower of cost on a first in first out basis and estimated net realisable
value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable
selling expenses. Inventory provisions are created where necessary to ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of
cost and estimated net realisable value.

**Financial instruments**

The Group classifies its financial assets into two categories, being fair value through profit and loss, and loans and
receivables. Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial liabilities.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired. Management
determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at
each reporting date.

Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade
and other receivables in the balance sheet.

**Financial assets**

The cost of investments, including loans to related parties, is their purchase cost together with any incremental costs
of acquisition. The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In deciding whether an impairment is required, the Directors
consider the underlying value inherent in the investment. Provision is made against the cost of investments where,
in the opinion of the Directors, there is an impairment in the value of the individual investment.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made
when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original
terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank
and cash in hand.

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Interest on borrowings is treated as an expense in the income statement, with the exception of interest costs incurred
on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.

**Issue costs of loans**

The issue costs recognised in the income statement in respect of capital instruments are allocated over the terms of
the instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.

**Early termination costs**

Costs associated with the early repayment of borrowings are written off to the income statement as incurred.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments have historically been
used by the Group to manage its exposure to interest rates on long-term floating-rate borrowings. All derivative
financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value. The Group does not currently hedge
account for any derivatives. As such, any gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the income statement.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

**Government grants**

Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are categorised as accruals on receipt and are credited to the
income statement over the useful life of the relevant property, plant and equipment. The government grant included
in the balance sheet at the period end represents grants received to date, less the amount so far credited to the
income statement.

**Provisions**

Provisions for legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result
of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is
determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an
outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations is small.

**Dividend distribution**

Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.

**Foreign currencies**

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. The resulting profit or loss, together with realised profits and losses arising during
the period on the settlement of overseas assets and liabilities, are included in the trading results.

**Employee benefits**

_Pensions_

—Defined contribution pension scheme

Group employees can choose to be a member of a defined contribution pension scheme. A defined contribution
pension scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The
Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets
to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions are
charged to the income statement as incurred.

—Defined benefit pension scheme

A funded senior management defined benefit pension scheme also exists. A defined benefit pension scheme is a
pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

The surplus or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together
with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates for
high-quality corporate bonds, which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 APRIL 2013

Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_Profit-sharing and bonus plans_

The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into
consideration the profit attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises
a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

_Holiday pay_

The Group recognises an appropriate liability for the cost of holiday entitlements not taken at the balance sheet date.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

**Other reserve**

The other reserve in the consolidated financial statements represents the differences on consolidation arising on the
adoption of predecessor accounting. This comprises the difference between consideration paid and the book value of
net assets acquired in the transaction.

The other reserve in the Company financial statements represents the application of group reconstruction relief in
accordance with section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, following the acquisition of certain subsidiaries in the
prior period from fellow group companies.

**New standards and interpretations**

The only new accounting standard or interpretation effective in the current period is a revision to IAS 12 ‘Income
taxes’ in respect of deferred tax and the recovery of underlying assets. This has not impacted, and is not likely to
have a future impact on, the financial statements of the Group and Company.

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and IFRIC have issued the following new or revised
standards and interpretations with an effective date for financial periods beginning on or after the dates disclosed

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating
Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the
Board of Directors.

The operating segments are the four holiday villages that the business operates. In addition there are certain
centralised administrative costs that cannot be allocated directly to an operating segment.

The primary profit measure used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker is Adjusted EBITDA, being earnings
before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation, exceptional items and owners’ costs (those costs payable to The
Blackstone Group and associated entities).

The internal reporting does not disaggregate the balance sheet to each operating segment.

The split of revenue was £179.3 million (2012: £169.2 million) for accommodation and £124.2 million (2012:
£122.5 million) for on-site spend. On-site revenue was impacted by the transfer of certain trading units to
concession partners during the prior period. The impact on revenue of these transfers, which only affected the first
half of the year, was approximately £2.7 million.

Change of corporation tax rate and factors that may affect future tax charges

Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 was included
in the Finance Act 2012. This announcement was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and hence has been
reflected in these financial statements.

Further reductions to the UK corporation tax rate have been announced which propose to reduce the rate to
21% from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015. These changes had not been substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date and therefore are not recognised in these financial statements. The effect of these proposed
changes would be to reduce the net deferred tax liability at the balance sheet date by £8.7 million (using a tax rate of
21%) or £13.0 million (using a tax rate of 20%). These decreases in the deferred tax liability would increase profit
by the same amount.

FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 APRIL 2013

**Impairment test for goodwill**

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s eight cash-generating units (CGUs), being the accommodation and on-site
revenue streams at each of the four villages. Goodwill by revenue stream is presented below:

**2013** **2012**
**£m** **£m**
Accommodation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **141.8** 141.8

**157.5** 157.5

The Directors consider that the economic characteristics and future expectations are materially consistent across
each of the villages within each revenue stream.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash
flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a one year period. Cash flows
beyond the one year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.

**Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations**

The key assumptions of the value-in-use calculation are EBITDA margin, perpetual growth rate and discount rate
for each of on-site and accommodation. The growth rate used is 2.5% (2012: 2.5%) in respect of both
accommodation and on-site. The discount rate used is 7.73% (2012: 7.73%) in respect of both accommodation and
on-site.

Management determine budgeted EBITDA margins based on past performance and expectations of market
development. The growth rates used reflect management’s expectations of the future market. Discount rates used
are pre-tax and reflect the specific risks to the Group.

Based on the value-in-use calculations performed, the Directors have concluded that there is no impairment of
goodwill. The Directors have performed sensitivity analysis using the full range of reasonable assumptions and no
impairment triggers have been identified.

The Company has no goodwill.

**Fair value hierarchy**

IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value
hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable
inputs).

All of the Group’s fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 2 in both the current and prior periods.
There were no transfers between levels during the current or prior periods.

**Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities**

The fair value of the Group’s securitised debt as at 25 April 2013 is:

**Book value** **Fair value**
**£m** **£m**
Tranche A1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 300.0 326.4

**1,020.0** **1,200.7**

Given the proximity of the Group’s prior period end to the refinancing that occurred on 28 February 2012, the fair
value of the securitised debt at 26 April 2012 was not considered to be materially different to its book value.

The fair value of all other financial assets and financial liabilities are approximately equal to their book values.

**Maturity of financial liabilities**

The non-discounted minimum future cash flows in respect of non-current financial liabilities are:

The Company has no non-current financial liabilities.

**Financial risk management**

The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity and borrowings as required. The Group has sought to
reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Group’s funding using the underlying asset value.

The overall policy in respect of interest rates is to reduce the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and the
Group’s primary source of borrowings is fixed interest rate loan notes.

The Group does not actively trade in derivative financial instruments.

issued in exchange for the novation and assignment of certain Group balances totalling £179.9 million. This gave
rise to a share premium of £179.9 million.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF
CP WOBURN (OPERATING COMPANY) LIMITED

**Independent auditors’ report to the members of CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited**

**Report on the financial statements**

_Our opinion_

In our opinion, CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited’s financial statements (the “financial statements”):

 - give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 23 April 2015 and of its loss and cash flows for the
52 week period (the “period”) then ended;

 - have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the
European Union; and

 - have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

_What we have audited_

CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited’s financial statements comprise:

 - the Balance Sheet as at 23 April 2015;

 - the Income Statement for the period then ended;

 - the Cash Flow Statement for the period then ended;

 - the Statement of Changes in Equity for the period then ended; and

 - the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory
information.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.

In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in
respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future
events.

**Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

**Other matters on which we are required to report by exception**

_Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received_

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

 - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

 - adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches
not visited by us; or

 - the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

_Directors’ remuneration_

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF
CP WOBURN (OPERATING COMPANY) LIMITED—(CONTINUED)

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

_Our responsibilities and those of the Directors_

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements set out on page 6, the
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.

Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). Those standards require us to comply with
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

**What an audit of financial statements involves**

We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:

 - whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and
adequately disclosed;

 - the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and

 - the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.

We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls,
substantive procedures or a combination of both.

In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Financial Statements to identify
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

they will afford the Company sufficient financial support as necessary to allow it to satisfy its liabilities as they fall
due, for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements. On this basis the financial
statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.

**Key assumptions and significant judgements**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates are principally used in the
following areas:

_Property, plant and equipment: Useful lives of assets and residual values (see accounting policy)_

_Intangible assets: Useful lives of assets and residual values (see accounting policy)_

**Revenue**

Revenue relates to villa rental income on holidays commenced during the period, together with other related income
that primarily arises from on-village leisure, retail and food and beverage spend. Non-rental income is recognised
when the related product or service is provided. All revenue is recorded net of VAT.

Payment for villa rental income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded as ‘payments on
account’ within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences.

A number of trading units on the holiday village are operated by concession partners. Revenue due in respect of
such units is recognised on a periodic basis as it is invoiced to the concession partner.

All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.

**Cost of sales**

Cost of sales comprise the cost of goods and services provided to guests. All costs to the point of sale, including
direct employee costs, are included within cost of sales.

**Operating segments**

The Company has a single operating segment, being the Woburn Center Parcs holiday village.

**Exceptional/non-underlying items**

Exceptional/non-underlying items are defined as those that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency,
warrant separate disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of
the Company. Non-underlying items are those that are not directly related to the ongoing trade of the business or
that are unrepresentative of ongoing performance.

**Intangible assets**

_Software_

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the
specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is generally considered to be
four years.

Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as
incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products
controlled by the Company, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are
recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate
portion of relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their
estimated useful lives, which do not exceed four years.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Depreciation is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment (except assets in the course of
construction), so as to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful
economic life of the assets concerned, using the following rates:

Installations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.67%

Fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14%

Motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25%

Computer hardware . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25%

Buildings are depreciated to residual value over 50 years. Land is not depreciated.

Useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and revised where expectations are
significantly different from previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for current and future periods
is adjusted accordingly.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the
cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other
borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the year in which they are incurred.

**Maintenance expenditure**

It is the policy of the Company to maintain its land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance
expenditure increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to generate, this expenditure is
capitalised. All other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

**Leases**

Leases are classified as finance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at cost and depreciated over their useful lives. The capital element
of future rentals is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged to the income statement over the period
of the lease in proportion to the capital outstanding.

Rental payments on operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor and including minimum
contractual rental increases) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.

**Current and deferred tax**

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

F-105


-----

CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed
by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are
defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or
the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Inventories**

The basis of valuation of inventories is the lower of cost on a first in first out basis and estimated net realisable
value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable
selling expenses. Inventory provisions are created where necessary to ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of
cost and estimated net realisable value.

**Financial instruments**

The Company classifies its financial assets into two categories, being fair value through profit and loss, and loans
and receivables. Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial
liabilities. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this
designation at each reporting date.

Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Company provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade
and other receivables in the balance sheet.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made
when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the
original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank
and cash in hand.

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Interest on borrowings is treated as an expense in the income statement, with the exception of interest costs incurred
on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.

**Early termination costs**

Costs associated with the early repayment of borrowings are written off to the income statement as incurred.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The Company does not trade in derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments (interest rate
swaps and caps) are used by the Company to manage its exposure to interest rates on long-term floating-rate

F-106

CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

borrowings. All derivative financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value. The
Company does not currently hedge account for any derivatives. As such, any gain or loss on remeasurement is taken
to the income statement.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

**Dividend distribution**

Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.

**Foreign currencies**

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. The resulting profit or loss, together with realised profits and losses arising during
the period on the settlement of overseas assets and liabilities, are included in the trading results. Transactions
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the
transaction.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**New standards and interpretations**

A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board with effective dates both prior to and post 23 April 2015. None of these have had, or are expected
to have, a significant impact on the financial statements of the Company.

The loan from parent undertaking was unsecured, interest-free and repayable on demand.

The bank borrowings were in respect of a VAT facility entered into on 28 February 2012. Under the terms of this
facility short-term funding was supplied to finance VAT due to suppliers prior to its recovery from HMRC. Interest
was payable on amounts drawn under this facility at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 4.25%. The total facility was
£10.0 million and a commitment fee of 2.125% was payable on the undrawn amount.

rate of 8% per annum on loans of £2.1 million (2014: £1.6 million) and at 12% per annum on the remainder. Interest
on all loans from parent undertaking are rolled up into the outstanding balance.

The bank borrowings are in respect of drawdowns on a term loan entered into on 28 February 2012. The total
facility is repayable on 28 February 2017; an option was taken up during the period to extend the repayment date

**Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities**

The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are approximately equal to their book values.

**Fair value hierarchy**

IFRS 13 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance
of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable
inputs).

All of the Company’s fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 2 and fair values are derived directly
from observable prices. There were no transfers between levels during the current or prior period.

**Fixed rate interest**

At the balance sheet date, all of the Company’s borrowings were at fixed rates of interest.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF
CP WOBURN (OPERATING COMPANY) LIMITED

**Independent auditors’ report to the members of CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited**

**Report on the financial statements**

_Our opinion_

In our opinion the financial statements, defined below:

 - give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 24 April 2014 and of its loss and cash flows for the
period then ended;

 - have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union; and

 - have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.

_What we have audited_

The financial statements, which are prepared by CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited, comprise:

 - balance sheet as at 24 April 2014;

 - the income statement for the period then ended;

 - the cash flow statement for the period then ended;

 - the statement of changes in equity for the period then ended; and

 - the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory
information.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted in the
European Union.

In applying the financial reporting framework, the Directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in
respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future
events.

_What an audit of financial statements involves_

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of:

 - whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and
adequately disclosed;

 - the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and

 - the overall presentation of the financial statements.

In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and financial statements (the
“Annual Report”) to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the
implications for our report.

**Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion, the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

not visited by us; or

 - the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

_Directors’ remuneration_

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

_Our responsibilities and those of the Directors_

As explained more fully in the Director’s Responsibilities Statement set out on page 3, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.

Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 24 APRIL 2014

**1.** **Accounting policies**

**General information**

The Company is a limited company, which is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered
office is One Edison Rise, New Ollerton, Newark, Nottinghamshire, NG22 9DP.

**Statement of compliance**

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations adopted by the
European Union (EU) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under
IFRS.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. All
accounting policies are consistent with the prior period.

**Basis of preparation**

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and on a going concern basis.

The accounts of CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited are typically drawn up to the Thursday nearest to its
accounting reference date of 22 April.

**Going concern**

The Directors have received confirmation that the parent company, CP Woburn Holdco Sarl, will provide sufficient
support to the Company to allow it to meet its debts and capital commitments as they fall due for a period of at least
12 months from the date of signing these financial statements. On this basis the financial statements have been
prepared on the going concern basis.

**Key assumptions and significant judgements**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

**Revenue**

Villa rental income will be recognised when holidays commence. Non-rental income will be recognised when the
related product or service is provided.

Payment for villa rental income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded as ‘payments on
account’ within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences.

**Property, plant and equipment**

The cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable costs. Depreciation is not provided on assets
in the course of construction.

**Capitalisation of interest**

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the
cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other
borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the year in which they are incurred.

**Leases**

Leases are classified as finance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at cost and depreciated over their useful lives. The capital element
of future rentals is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged to the income statement over the period
of the lease in proportion to the capital outstanding.

CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 24 APRIL 2014

Rental payments on operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor and including minimum
contractual rental increases) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.

**Current and deferred tax**

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed
by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are
defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or
the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Inventories**

The basis of valuation of inventories is the lower of cost on a first in first out basis and estimated net realisable
value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable
selling expenses. Inventory provisions are created where necessary to ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of
cost and estimated net realisable value.

**Financial instruments**

The Company classifies its financial assets into two categories, being fair value through profit and loss, and loans
and receivables. Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial
liabilities. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this
designation at each reporting date.

Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Company provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade
and other receivables in the balance sheet.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank
and cash in hand.

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The Company does not trade in derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments (interest rate
swaps and caps) are used by the Company to manage its exposure to interest rates on long-term floating-rate

F-123


-----

CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 24 APRIL 2014

borrowings. All derivative financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value. The
Company does not currently hedge account for any derivatives. As such, any gain or loss on remeasurement is taken
to the income statement.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**New standards and interpretations**

New accounting standards or interpretations effective in the current period are as follows:

      - A revision to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’ in respect of the presentation of other comprehensive
income;

      - A revision to IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ in respect of the remeasurement of termination benefits; and

      - A new accounting standard IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’, setting out a framework for measuring fair
value and required disclosures.

These have not impacted, and are not likely to have a future impact on, the financial statements of the Company.

The adoption of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which is expected to be enacted in 2018, is expected to change the
disclosure given in respect of financial instruments but not the amounts reported in the financial statements. In
addition, the International Accounting Standards Board and IFRIC have issued a number of further standards and
interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements. The Directors do not anticipate that
the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Company’s financial
statements in the period of initial application.

Operating loss is stated after charging the following:

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

inputs).

the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

**Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors**

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 2, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with

assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

**Scope of the audit of the financial statements**

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors;
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in
the annual report and financial statements to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

**Opinion on financial statements**

In our opinion the financial statements:

 - give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 25 April 2013 and of its loss and cash flows for the
period then ended;

 - have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and

prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in
our opinion:

 - adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches
not visited by us; or

 - the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

 - certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 APRIL 2013

**1.** **Accounting policies**

**General information**

The Company is a limited company, which is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered
office is One Edison Rise, New Ollerton, Newark, Nottinghamshire, NG22 9DP.

**Statement of compliance**

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations adopted by the
European Union (EU) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under
IFRS.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. All
accounting policies are consistent with the prior period.

**Basis of preparation**

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and on a going concern basis.

The accounts of CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited are typically drawn up to the Thursday nearest to its
accounting reference date of 22 April.

**Going concern**

The Directors have received confirmation that the parent company, CP Woburn Holdco Sarl, will provide sufficient
support to the Company to allow it to meet its debts and capital commitments as they fall due for a period of at least
12 months from the date of signing these financial statements. On this basis the financial statements have been
prepared on the going concern basis.

**Key assumptions and significant judgements**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

**Financial instruments**

The Company classifies its financial instruments into two categories: Financial assets at fair value through profit
and loss, and loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments
were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and reevaluates this designation at each reporting date.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Company provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade
and other receivables in the balance sheet.

**Capitalisation of interest**

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the
cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other
borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the year in which they are incurred.

**Property, plant and equipment**

The cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable costs. Depreciation is not provided on assets
in the course of construction.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 APRIL 2013

**Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank
and cash in hand.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**Current and deferred tax**

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed
by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are
defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or
the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The Company does not trade in derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments (interest rate
swaps and caps) are used by the Company to manage its exposure to interest rates on long-term floating-rate
borrowings. All derivative financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value.

The Company does not currently hedge account for any derivatives. As such, any gain or loss on remeasurement is
taken to the income statement.

**New standards and interpretations**

The adoption of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is expected to change the disclosure given in respect of financial
instruments but not the amounts reported in the financial statements. In addition, the International Accounting
Standards Board and IFRIC have issued a number of further standards and interpretations with an effective date
after the date of these financial statements. The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and
interpretations will have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements in the period of initial application.

**2.** **Operating loss**

Auditors’ remuneration of £5,000 (2012: £3,000) was incurred during the period.

**3.** **Employees**

The Company had a monthly average of one employee during the period (2012: none). Payroll costs incurred during
the period were £78,000 (2012: £nil), being salaries of £62,000, social security of £10,000 and pension costs of
£6,000. In addition, the Company incurred £784,000 (2012: £34,000) in respect of staff costs recharged from a
related company.

The Directors received no remuneration from the Company (2012: £nil).

The Company has losses of approximately £3.2 million (2012: £0.2 million) to utilise against future profits. The
Company has not recognised these as a deferred tax asset.

Change of corporation tax rate and factors that may affect future tax charges

Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 was included
in the Finance Act 2012. This announcement was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and hence has been
reflected in these financial statements.

Further reductions to the UK corporation tax rate have been announced which propose to reduce the rate to 21%
from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015. These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date and therefore are not recognised in these financial statements.

**Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities**

The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are approximately equal to their book values.

**Fair value hierarchy**

IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance
of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable
inputs).

All of the Company’s fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 2. There were no transfers between
levels during the period.

**Fixed rate interest**

At the balance sheet date, all of the Company’s borrowings were at fixed rates of interest.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF
CPUK FINANCE LIMITED

**Independent auditors’ report to the members of CPUK Finance Limited**

**Report on the financial statements**

_Our opinion_

In our opinion the financial statements:

 - give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 23 April 2015 and of its result and cash flows for the
52 week period (the “period”) then ended;

 - have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union; and

 - have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.

This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say below.

_What we have audited_

The financial statements for the period ended 23 April 2015, which are prepared by CPUK Finance Limited, comprise:

 - the Balance Sheet as at 23 April 2015;

 - the Income statement for the period then ended;

 - the Cash Flow Statement for the period then ended;

 - the Statement in Changes in Equity for the period then ended; and

 - the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of the significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and International
_Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union._

In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in
respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future
events.

_What an audit of financial statements involves_

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland))
(“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:

 - whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and
adequately disclosed;

 - the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and

 - the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.

We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls,
substantive procedures or a combination of both.

In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual report and financial statements to identify
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF
CPUK FINANCE LIMITED—(CONTINUED)

**Opinion on other matter**

In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

**Other matters on which we are required to report by exception**

_Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received_

Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

 - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

 - adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches
not visited by us; or

 - the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

_Our responsibilities and those of the directors_

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 3, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.

Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with
Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

CPUK Finance Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

**1.** **Accounting policies**

**General information**

The Company was incorporated under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, as a public limited liability
company. The address of its registered office is 47 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey, JE1 0BD. The Company is resident
in the UK for tax purposes.

**Statement of compliance**

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations adopted by the
European Union (EU) and with those parts of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 applicable to companies reporting
under IFRS.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. All
accounting policies are consistent with the prior period.

**Basis of preparation**

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, fair value requirements and on a
going concern basis.

The Company’s accounting reference date is 22 April.

**Key assumptions and significant judgements**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

**Financial instruments**

The Company classifies its financial assets into two categories, being fair value through profit and loss, and loans
and receivables. Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial
liabilities. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this
designation at each reporting date.

Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Company provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade
and other receivables in the balance sheet.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank
and cash in hand.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**Dividend distribution**

Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.

CPUK Finance Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

**Current and deferred tax**

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities. The Company is
resident in the UK for tax purposes and is subject to The Taxation of Securitisation Companies Regulations.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed
by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are
defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the
deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The Company does not trade in derivative financial instruments. All derivative financial instruments are measured
at the balance sheet date at their fair value. Any asset or liability in respect of derivative financial instruments is
ultimately recognised by the Group and hence any gain or loss on remeasurement is recorded in the income
statement of the relevant entity.

**New standards and interpretations**

A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board with effective dates both prior to and post 23 April 2015. None of these have had, or are expected
to have, a significant impact on the financial statements of the Company.

**2.** **Operating costs**

All operating costs incurred by the Company are recovered, by way of an ongoing facility fee arrangement, from the
Group under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. Operating costs include audit fees of £7,000 (2014: £7,000)
which were recharged to the Group.

**3.** **Directors’ emoluments and Employees**

The Company has no employees (2014: none). No salaries or wages have been paid to employees, including the
Directors, during the period (2014: £nil).

**Fair value hierarchy**

IFRS 13 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance
of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

All of the Company’s fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 2 and fair values are derived directly
from observable prices. There were no transfers between levels during the current or prior period.

**Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities**

On 28 February 2012 the Company issued the following tranches of fixed rate loan notes (“Notes”). The assets of
the Group were provided as security for the debt, and the funds raised were advanced to the Group. Total fees of
£34.6 million were incurred by the Group in respect of the issuance of Notes. These costs were borne by the Group
and were not recharged to CPUK Finance Limited.

Tranche A1

Total value of £300.0 million with an expected maturity date of 28 February 2017 and a final maturity date of
28 February 2042. Interest is charged at 4.811% until expected maturity and 7.169% thereafter.

On 22 May 2015 the Group announced the pricing of an aggregate of £490.0 million of New Class A senior notes,
divided into £350.0 million 2.666% notes due to mature in February 2020 and £140.0 million 3.588% notes due to
mature in August 2025. The proceeds of these new notes, along with existing cash resources available, will
refinance the Class A1 notes, which are due to mature in 2017, and fund the acquisition of the equity share capital
of CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited. The refinancing is expected to complete on 11 June 2015.

Tranche A2

Total value of £440.0 million with an expected maturity date of 28 February 2024 and a final maturity date of
28 February 2042. Interest is charged at 7.239% until expected maturity and 7.919% thereafter.

Tranche B

Total value of £280.0 million with an expected maturity date of 28 February 2018 and a final maturity date of
28 February 2042. Interest is charged at 11.625% until expected maturity and 6.25% thereafter.

The tranche B debt is subordinated to the tranche A debt. Both include optional prepayment clauses permitting the
Company to repay the debt in advance of the expected maturity date. All tranches of debt are subject to a financial
covenant. There was significant headroom on the covenants as at 23 April 2015. The Directors have assessed future
compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial covenant.

CPUK Finance Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

As all tranches have fixed interest rates, the Company is not exposed to interest rate fluctuations. All amounts are
denominated in £ sterling.

Derivative financial instruments related to securitised debt

The option to repay the B debt prior to maturity is considered to be a derivative financial instrument with a fair
value of £16.8 million (2014: £nil), such fair value being estimated with reference to the yields of similar corporate
bonds with comparable terms and credit ratings. The movement in the fair value is recognised in the income
statement of the Group.

_Management of capital_

The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal
capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, and sell assets to reduce debt or borrow additional
debt.

mature in August 2025. The proceeds of these new notes, along with existing cash resources available, will
refinance the Class A1 notes, which are due to mature in 2017, and fund the acquisition of the equity share capital
of CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited. The refinancing is expected to complete on 11 June 2015.

On 2 June 2015 it was announced that a Brookfield-managed fund has agreed to acquire the parent company of the
Center Parcs group, and consequently its subsidiary undertakings, from funds advised by The Blackstone Group.
The transaction is due to complete by the end of July 2015.

**15.** **Controlling parties**

The issued share capital of the Company is held by, or on behalf of, Structured Finance Management Offshore
Limited, acting in its capacity as Trustee of the CPUK Finance Charitable Trust, on a discretionary trust basis for
the benefit of charitable purposes. Structured Finance Management Offshore Limited is the immediate and ultimate
parent company.

The consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited incorporate the results of the Company.
This is the largest and smallest group that includes the results of CPUK Finance Limited in its group accounts. The
Directors of both CPUK Finance Limited and Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited consider that the Company meets
the definition of a special purpose entity under SIC 12 ‘Consolidation—Special Purpose Entities’ and hence for the
purpose of the consolidated financial statements it has been treated as a subsidiary undertaking.

A copy of the Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited financial statements can be obtained on application to The
Company Secretary, One Edison Rise, New Ollerton, Newark, Nottinghamshire, NG22 9DP.

CPUK Finance Limited
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF
CPUK FINANCE LIMITED

**Independent auditors’ report to the members of CPUK Finance Limited**

**Report on the financial statements**

_Our opinion_

In our opinion the financial statements, defined below:

 - give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 24 April 2014 and of its result for the period then
ended;

 - have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union; and

 - have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.

This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.

_What we have audited_

The financial statements, which are prepared by CPUK Finance Limited, comprise:

 - balance sheet as at 24 April 2014;

 - the income statement for the period then ended;

 - the statement of changes in equity for the period then ended;

 - the cash flow statement for the period then ended; and

 - the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory
information.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted in the
European Union.

In applying the financial reporting framework, the Directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in
respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future
events.

_What an audit of financial statements involves_

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of:

 - whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and
adequately disclosed;

 - the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and

 - the overall presentation of the financial statements.

CPUK Finance Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 24 APRIL 2014

**1.** **Accounting policies**

**General information**

The Company was incorporated under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, as a public limited liability
company. The address of its registered office is 47 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey, JE1 0BD. The Company is resident
in the UK for tax purposes.

**Statement of compliance**

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations adopted by the
European Union (EU) and with those parts of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 applicable to companies reporting
under IFRS.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. All
accounting policies are consistent with the prior period.

**Basis of preparation**

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, fair value requirements and on a
going concern basis.

The accounts of CPUK Finance Limited are typically drawn up to the Thursday nearest to its accounting reference
date of 22 April.

**Key assumptions and significant judgements**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

**Financial instruments**

The Company classifies its financial assets into two categories, being fair value through profit and loss, and loans
and receivables. Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial
liabilities. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this
designation at each reporting date.

Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Company provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade
and other receivables in the balance sheet.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank
and cash in hand.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**Dividend distribution**

Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.

CPUK Finance Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 24 APRIL 2014

**Current and deferred tax**

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed
by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are
defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or
the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**New standards and interpretations**

New accounting standards or interpretations effective in the current period are as follows:

      - A revision to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’ in respect of the presentation of other comprehensive
income;

      - A revision to IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ in respect of the remeasurement of termination benefits; and

      - A new accounting standard IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’, setting out a framework for measuring fair
value and required disclosures.

These have not significantly impacted, and are not likely to have a future impact on, the financial statements of the
Company.

The adoption of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which is expected to be enacted in 2018, is expected to change the
disclosure given in respect of financial instruments but not the amounts reported in the financial statements. In
addition, the International Accounting Standards Board and IFRIC have issued a number of further standards and
interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements. The Directors do not anticipate that
the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Company’s financial
statements in the period of initial application.

**2.** **Operating costs**

All operating costs incurred by the Company are recovered, by way of an ongoing facility fee arrangement, from the
Group under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. Operating costs include audit fees of £7,000 (2013: £7,000)
which were recharged to the Group.

**3.** **Directors and employees**

The Company has no employees (2013: none) and services required are contracted from third parties. No salaries or
wages have been paid to employees, and the Directors received no remuneration from the Company in respect of
qualifying services rendered to the Company during the period (2013: £nil).

**6.** **Taxation**

The Company is resident in the UK for tax purposes.

**(a)** **Taxation**

The tax charge for the period is £nil (2013: £nil).

**(b)** **Factors affecting the tax charge**

The tax assessed for the current and prior period is the same as that resulting from applying the standard rate of
corporation tax in the UK of 23% (2013: 24%).

Change of corporation tax rate and factors that may affect future tax charges

The March 2013 Budget included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% with
effect from 1 April 2014, and to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. This legislation was substantively enacted for
financial reporting purposes on 2 July 2013.

**Fair value hierarchy**

IFRS 13 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance
of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

All of the Company’s fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 2 and fair values are derived directly
from observable prices. There were no transfers between levels during the current or prior period.

**Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities**

The fair values of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities as at 24 April 2014 are:

**Book value** **Fair value**

On 28 February 2012 the Company issued the following tranches of fixed rate loan notes (“Notes”). The assets of
the Group were provided as security for the debt, and the funds raised were advanced to the Group.

Total fees of £34.6 million were incurred by the Group in respect of the issuance of Notes. These costs were borne
by the Group and were not recharged to CPUK Finance Limited.

Tranche A1

Total value of £300.0 million with an expected maturity date of 28 February 2017 and a final maturity date of
28 February 2042. Interest is charged at 4.811% until expected maturity and 7.169% thereafter.

Tranche A2

Total value of £440.0 million with an expected maturity date of 28 February 2024 and a final maturity date of
28 February 2042. Interest is charged at 7.239% until expected maturity and 7.919% thereafter.

Tranche B

Total value of £280.0 million with an expected maturity date of 28 February 2018 and a final maturity date of
28 February 2042. Interest is charged at 11.625% until expected maturity and 6.25% thereafter.

The tranche B debt is subordinated to the tranche A debt. Both include optional prepayment clauses permitting the
Company to repay the debt in advance of the expected maturity date. All tranches of debt are subject to a financial
covenant. There was significant headroom on the covenants as at 24 April 2014. The Directors have assessed future
compliance and significant headroom is forecast. As such they do not foresee any breach of the financial covenant.

As all tranches have fixed interest rates, the Company is not exposed to interest rate fluctuations.

All amounts are denominated in £ sterling.

We have audited the financial statements of CPUK Finance Limited for the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2013 which comprises
the Income Statement, the Statement of Changes in Equity, the Balance Sheet, the Cash Flow Statement and the related notes.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

**Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors**

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 3, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with
Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

**Scope of the audit of the financial statements**

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors;
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in
the annual report and financial statements to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

**Opinion on financial statements**

In our opinion the financial statements:

 - give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 25 April 2013 and of its result and cash flows for the
period then ended;

 - have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and

 - have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.

**Opinion on other matters**

In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial period for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report to
you if, in our opinion:

 - proper accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not
visited by us; or

 - the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

 - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

CPUK Finance Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 APRIL 2013

**1.** **Accounting policies**

**General information**

The Company was incorporated under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, as a public limited liability
company. The address of its registered office is 47 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey, JE1 0BD. The Company is resident
in the UK for tax purposes.

**Statement of compliance**

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations adopted by the
European Union (EU) and with those parts of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 applicable to companies reporting
under IFRS.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. All
accounting policies are consistent with the prior period.

**Basis of preparation**

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, fair value requirements and on a
going concern basis.

The accounts of CPUK Finance Limited are typically drawn up to the Thursday nearest to its accounting reference
date of 22 April.

**Key assumptions and significant judgements**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

**Financial instruments**

The Company classifies its financial assets into two categories, being fair value through profit and loss, and loans
and receivables. Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial
liabilities. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this
designation at each reporting date.

Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Company provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade
and other receivables in the balance sheet.

**Financial assets**

The cost of investments, including loans to associated companies, is their purchase cost together with any
incremental costs of acquisition.

The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a
group of financial assets is impaired. In deciding whether an impairment is required, the Directors consider the
underlying value inherent in the investment. Provision is made against the cost of investments where, in the opinion
of the Directors, there is an impairment in the value of the individual investment.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank
and cash in hand.

F-175


-----

CPUK Finance Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 APRIL 2013

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**Dividend distribution**

Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.

**Current and deferred tax**

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed
by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are
defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or
the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**Early termination costs**

Costs associated with the early repayment of borrowings are written off to the income statement as incurred.

**New standards and interpretations**

The only new accounting standard or interpretation effective in the current period is a revision to IAS 12 ‘Income
taxes’ in respect of deferred tax and the recovery of underlying assets. This has not impacted, and is not likely to
have a future impact on, the financial statements of the Company.

The adoption of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is expected to change the disclosure given in respect of financial
instruments but not the amounts reported in the financial statements. In addition, the International Accounting
Standards Board and IFRIC have issued a number of further standards and interpretations with an effective date
after the date of these financial statements. The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and
interpretations will have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements in the period of initial application.

**2.** **Operating costs**

All operating costs incurred by the Company are recovered, by way of an ongoing facility fee arrangement, from the
Group under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. Operating costs include audit fees of £7,000 (2012: £7,000)
which were recharged to the Group.

**3.** **Employees**

The Company has no employees (2012: none). No salaries or wages have been paid to employees, including the
Directors, during the period (2012: £nil).

**6.** **Taxation**

The Company is resident in the UK for tax purposes.

**(a)** **Taxation**

The tax charge for the period is £nil (2012: £nil).

**(b)** **Factors affecting the tax charge**

The tax assessed for the current and prior period is the same as that resulting from applying the standard rate of
corporation tax in the UK of 24% (2012: 26%).

Change of corporation tax rate and factors that may affect future tax charges

Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 was included
in the Finance Act 2012. This announcement was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and hence has been
reflected in these financial statements.

Further reductions to the UK corporation tax rate have been announced which propose to reduce the rate to 21%
from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015. These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date and therefore are not recognised in these financial statements.

**Fair value hierarchy**

IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance
of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable
inputs).

All of the Company’s fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 2. There were no transfers between
levels during the period.

The tranche B debt is subordinated to the tranche A debt. Both include optional prepayment clauses permitting the
Company to repay the debt in advance of the expected maturity date. All tranches of debt are subject to a financial
covenant. The Directors have assessed future compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF
CENTER PARCS (OPERATING COMPANY) LIMITED

**Independent auditors’ report to the members of Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited**

**Report on the financial statements**

_Our opinion_

In our opinion, Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited’s financial statements (the “financial statements”):

 - give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 23 April 2015 and of its profit and cash flows for the
52 week period (the “period”) then ended;

 - have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the
European Union; and

 - have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

_What we have audited_

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited’s financial statements comprise:

 - the Balance Sheet as at 23 April 2015;

 - the Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period then ended;

 - the Cash Flow Statement for the period then ended;

 - the Statement of Changes in Equity for the period then ended; and

 - the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory
information.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.

In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in
respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future
events.

**Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

**Other matters on which we are required to report by exception**

_Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received_

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

 - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

 - adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches
not visited by us; or

 - the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

_Directors’ remuneration_

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF
CENTER PARCS (OPERATING COMPANY) LIMITED—(CONTINUED)

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

_Our responsibilities and those of the Directors_

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements set out on page 6,
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view.

Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). Those standards require us to comply with
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

**What an audit of financial statements involves**

We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:

 - whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and
adequately disclosed;

 - the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and

 - the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.

We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls,
substantive procedures or a combination of both.

In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and financial statements to identify
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Cost of sales and administrative expenses have been restated for the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2014 in order to more
accurately reflect the nature of expenses incurred by the Company. Total costs of £53.0 million have been transferred from
administrative expenses to cost of sales, principally in respect of payroll costs. This restatement has had no impact on
operating profit.

Exceptional/non-underlying administrative expenses are costs incurred in respect of the Group’s ongoing review of its
strategic options.

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

**1** **Accounting policies**

**General information**

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited operates short break holiday villages in Nottinghamshire, Cumbria,
Wiltshire and Suffolk.

The Company is a limited company, which is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered
office is One Edison Rise, New Ollerton, Newark, Nottinghamshire, NG22 9DP.

**Statement of compliance**

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations endorsed by
the European Union (EU) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under
IFRS.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. All
accounting policies disclosed have been applied consistently to both periods presented.

**Basis of preparation**

The financial statements have been prepared as a going concern under the historical cost convention.

The Company was, at the end of the period, a wholly-owned subsidiary of another company incorporated in the
EEA and in accordance with Section 400 of the Companies Act 2006, is not required to produce, and has not
published, consolidated accounts.

**Key assumptions and significant judgements**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates are principally used in the
following areas:

_Property, plant and equipment: Useful lives of assets and residual values (see accounting policy)._

_Impairment test for goodwill: Growth and discount rates (note 7)._

_Other intangible assets: Useful lives of assets and residual values (see accounting policy)._

_Retirement benefits: Actuarial assumptions in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme (note 18)._

**Revenue**

Revenue relates to one continuing activity, being the provision of short break holidays.

Revenue relates to villa rental income on holidays commenced during the period, together with other related income
that primarily arises from on-village leisure, retail and food and beverage spend. Non-rental income is recognised
when the related product or service is provided. All revenue is recorded net of VAT.

Payment for villa rental income is paid in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded as ‘payments on
account’ within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences.

A number of trading units on each holiday village are operated by concession partners. Revenue due in respect of
such units is recognised on a periodic basis as it is invoiced to the concession partner.

All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.

**Cost of sales**

Cost of sales comprise the cost of goods and services provided to guests. All costs to the point of sale, including
direct employee costs, are included within cost of sales.

**Exceptional/non-underlying items**

Exceptional items are defined as those items that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency, warrant
separate disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the
Company. Non-underlying items are those that are not directly related to the ongoing trade of the business or that
are unrepresentative of ongoing performance.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is instead
tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is
allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.

**Other intangible assets**

_Software_

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the
specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is generally considered to be
four years.

Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the
Company, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as
intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of
relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated
useful lives, which do not exceed four years.

**Impairment of assets**

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Where required, assets are discounted using an AAA corporate
bond rate. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).

**Leases**

Leases are classified as finance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at cost and depreciated over their useful lives. The capital element
of future rentals is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged to the income statement over the period
of the lease in proportion to the capital outstanding.

Rental payments on operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor and including minimum
contractual rental increases) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Management chose the cost basis under IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’, rather than to apply the alternative
(revaluation) treatment to all items of property, plant and equipment as its ongoing accounting policy. The cost of
property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable costs.

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

Depreciation is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment (except assets in the course of
construction), so as to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful
economic life of the assets concerned, using the following rates:

Leasehold improvements . . . . . . 2.5% or by equal instalments over the period of the lease held on the land and
buildings, whichever is the shorter

Installations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.67% or by equal instalments over the period of the lease held on the land and
buildings, whichever is the shorter

Fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . 14% or by equal instalments over the period of the lease held on the land and
buildings, whichever is the shorter

Computer equipment . . . . . . . . . 25%

Motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25%

Useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and revised where expectations are
significantly different from previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for current and future periods
is adjusted accordingly.

**Maintenance expenditure**

It is the policy of the Company to maintain its leasehold land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance
expenditure increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to generate, this expenditure is
capitalised. All other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

**Investments in subsidiary undertakings**

Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for permanent diminution in value. If there are indications of
impairment, an assessment is made of the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income
statement when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value.

Dividends receivable from investments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised in the income statement when
approved by the shareholders of the company paying the dividend.

**Current and deferred tax**

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed
by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are
defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or
the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Inventories**

The basis of valuation of inventories is the lower of cost on a first in first out basis and estimated net realisable
value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable
selling expenses. Inventory provisions are created where necessary to ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of
cost and estimated net realisable value.

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

**Financial instruments**

The Company classifies its financial assets into two categories, being fair value through profit and loss, and loans
and receivables. Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial
liabilities. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this
designation at each reporting date.

Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Company provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade
and other receivables in the balance sheet.

**Investments**

The cost of investments, including loans to related parties, is their purchase cost together with any incremental costs
of acquisition. The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In deciding whether an impairment is required, the Directors
consider the underlying value inherent in the investment. Provision is made against the cost of investments where,
in the opinion of the Directors, there is an impairment in the value of the individual investment.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made
when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the
original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.

**Long-term receivables**

Where the effect is material, long-term receivables are discounted using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank
and in hand.

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**Early termination costs**

Costs associated with the early repayment of borrowings are written off to the income statement as incurred.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The Company does not trade in derivative financial instruments. All derivative financial instruments are measured
at the balance sheet date at their fair value. The Company does not currently hedge account for any derivatives. As
such, any gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the income statement.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

F-192


-----

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 23 APRIL 2015

Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

**Government grants**

Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are categorised as accruals on receipt and are credited to the
income statement over the useful life of the relevant property, plant and equipment. The government grant included
in the balance sheet at the period end represents grants received to date, less the amount so far credited to the
income statement.

**Provisions**

Provisions for legal claims are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a
result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation,
and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is
determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an
outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations is small.

**Dividend distribution**

Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.

**Foreign currencies**

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. The resulting profit or loss, together with realised profits and losses arising during
the period on the settlement of overseas assets and liabilities, are included in the trading results. Transactions
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the
transaction.

**Employee benefits**

_Pensions_

—Defined contribution pension scheme

Company employees can choose to be a member of a defined contribution pension scheme. A defined contribution
pension scheme is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The
Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient
assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions
are charged to the income statement as incurred.

—Defined benefit pension scheme

A funded senior management defined benefit pension scheme also exists. A defined benefit pension scheme is a
pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

The surplus or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together
with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates for
high-quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.

Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Remeasurement gains and losses are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

_Profit-sharing and bonus plans_

The Company recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes
into consideration the profit attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Company
recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive
obligation.

_Holiday pay_

The Company recognises an appropriate liability for the cost of holiday entitlements not taken at the balance sheet
date.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds.

**New standards and interpretations**

A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board with effective dates both prior to and post 23 April 2015. None of these have had, or are expected
to have, a significant impact on the financial statements of the Company.

**2** **Financial risk management**

The Company finances its operations through a mixture of equity and borrowings as required. The Company has
sought to reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Company’s funding using the underlying
asset value.

All tranches of the Company’s secured debt are subject to financial covenants. The Director have assessed future
compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial covenants.

The overall policy in respect of interest rates is to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and the
Company’s primary source of borrowings is fixed interest rate loan notes.

The Company does not actively trade in derivative financial instruments.

**Interest rate risk**

The Company has a floating rate mortgage and fixed rate loan notes as its only external funding sources. As at
23 April 2015, 99% (2014: 99%) of the Company’s external borrowings incurred interest at a fixed rate.

**Liquidity risk**

At 23 April 2015, the Company held sufficient levels of cash to enable it to meet its medium-term working capital
and funding obligations. Rolling forecasts of the Company’s liquidity requirements are prepared and monitored, and
surplus cash is invested in interest bearing accounts.

**Currency risk**

The Company is exposed to limited currency risk through foreign currency transactions. The Company does not
operate a hedging facility to manage currency risk as it is considered to be insignificant.

**Credit risk**

The Company borrows from well-established institutions with high credit ratings. The Company’s cash balances are
held on deposit with a number of UK banking institutions.

In addition to the above services, the Company’s auditors act as auditor to the Center Parcs pension scheme. The
appointment of auditors to the Company’s pension scheme and fees paid in respect of those audits are agreed by the
trustees of the scheme who act independently from the management of the Company. The aggregate fees paid to the
auditors for these services during the period were £6,000 (2014: £5,000). The Directors monitor the level of nonaudit work undertaken by the auditors and ensure it is work which they are best suited to perform and does not
present a risk to their independence and objectivity.

Exceptional/non-underlying administrative expenses of £6.3 million are costs incurred in respect of the Group’s
ongoing review of its strategic options.

**Impairment test for goodwill**

Goodwill is allocated to the Company’s eight cash-generating units (CGUs), being the accommodation and on-site
revenue streams at each of the four villages. Goodwill by business stream is presented below:

**2015** **2014**
**£m** **£m**

**244.1** 244.1

The Directors consider that the economic characteristics and future expectations are materially consistent across
each of the villages within each business stream.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash
flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a one year period. Cash flows
beyond the one year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.

**Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations:**

The key assumptions of the value in use calculation are EBITDA margin, perpetual growth rate and discount rate
for each of on-site and accommodation. The long-term growth rate used is 2.5% (2014: 2.5%) in respect of both
accommodation and on-site. The discount rate used is 7.73% (2014: 7.73%) in respect of both accommodation and
on-site.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)

Management determine budgeted EBITDA margins based on past performance and expectations of market
development. The growth rates used reflect management’s expectations of the future market. Discount rates used
are pre-tax and reflect the specific risks to the Company.

The Directors have performed sensitivity analysis using the full range of reasonable assumptions and no impairment
triggers have been identified.

Based on the value-in-use calculations performed, the Directors have concluded that there is no impairment of
goodwill.

The Directors believe that the carrying value of investments in subsidiary undertakings is supported by the
underlying net assets of the investee.

Center Parcs Limited made a pre-tax profit of £0.7 million for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2015 (2014: profit of
£0.7 million) and its net assets at that date were £11.3 million (24 April 2014: £10.6 million).

A £2.9 million rental deposit was paid on the inception of the Longleat lease, repayable to the Company in the final
year of the lease. The fair value of the rental deposit above is calculated with reference to AAA Corporate Bond
rates.

Amounts owed by Group undertakings include a loan of £198.5 million (2014: £198.5 million) due from Center
Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and the associated unpaid interest. Interest is receivable at a rate of 8% per annum and is
not compounded.

The remaining amounts owed by Group undertakings are trading balances and do not attract interest.

All amounts owed by Group undertakings are unsecured and repayable on demand.

The fair value of trade and other receivables is equal to its book value and no impairment provisions have been
made (2014: £nil). Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the vast majority
of customers paying in advance. As such there are no amounts past due as all amounts are current (2014: £nil).

All of the amounts above are denominated in £ sterling.

**Securitised debt**

At 23 April 2015 the securitised debt was part of an overall £1,020.0 million facility made available to the Group.
The total facility was drawn down on 28 February 2012. Details of the tranches of the debt are as follows:


**Expected**
**Maturity Date** **Final Maturity Date**


**Interest rate to**
**Expected**
**Maturity Date**


**Interest rate from**

**Date to Final**

**Expected**
**Maturity Date** **Final Maturity Date**


Tranche B . . . . . . . . . . . 11.625% 6.25% 28 February 2018 28 February 2042

The tranche B debt is subordinated to the tranche A debt. Both include optional prepayment clauses permitting the
Company to repay the debt in advance of the expected maturity date. All tranches of debt are subject to financial
covenants. The Directors have assessed future compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial
covenant.

The option to repay the B debt prior to maturity is considered to be a derivative financial instrument with a fair
value of £5.5 million (2014: £nil). The fair value has been estimated with reference to the yields of similar corporate
bonds with comparable terms and credit ratings. The movement in fair value has been recognised as an exceptional/
non-underlying item in the income statement.

The derivative financial instrument recognised by the Group is £16.8 million and this has been apportioned to the
individual borrowers in line with the tranche B debt held by each entity.

As all tranches have fixed interest rates, the Company is not exposed to interest rate fluctuations. Interest of
£3.8 million (2014: £3.9 million) was accrued in respect of the loans in the period.

The tranche A1 notes will be repaid, at the option of the Group, shortly after the financial year-end as set out in note
23; unamortised deferred issue costs relating to this tranche of the securitised debt have been amortised on an
accelerated basis to reflect this repayment profile. This accelerated amortisation has been classified as an
exceptional/non-underlying finance expense of £1.4 million in the income statement.

**13** **Financial instruments**

**Financial instruments by category**

The accounting policies for financial instruments have been applied to the line items below. The Company’s
financial assets are categorised as loans and receivables, with the exception of derivative financial instruments

**Fair value hierarchy**

IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance
of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable
inputs).

All of the Company’s fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 2 and fair values are derived directly
or indirectly from observable prices. There were no transfers between levels during the current or prior period.

**Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities**

The fair value of the Company’s gross securitised debt (before unamortised debt costs) at 23 April 2015 was
£399.7 million (2014: £386.8 million). The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities of the Company are
approximately equal to their book value.

**Maturity of financial liabilities**

**Defined contribution pension scheme**

The Company participates in the Center Parcs pension scheme, which is a defined contribution pension scheme with
a contributory and a non-contributory membership level. Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme for the
period ended 23 April 2015 were £2.3 million (2014: £2.4 million).

Accruals per note 11 include £0.3 million (2014: £0.3 million) in respect of defined contribution pension scheme
costs.

**Defined benefit pension scheme**

The Company operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme for certain employees. Contributions are
determined by an independent qualified actuary using assumptions on the rate of return on investments and rates of
increases in salaries and benefits.

The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was performed on 1 August 2011. This was updated to 23 April 2015 by
a qualified independent actuary. An actuarial valuation was performed as at 1 August 2014 but had not been
received at the balance sheet date.

The principal assumptions used were:

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF
CENTER PARCS (OPERATING COMPANY) LIMITED

**Independent auditors’ report to the members of Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited**

**Report on the financial statements**

_Our opinion_

In our opinion the financial statements, defined below:

 - give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 24 April 2014 and of its profit and cash flows for the
period then ended;

 - have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union; and

 - have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.

_What we have audited_

The financial statements, which are prepared by Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited, comprise:

 - balance sheet as at 24 April 2014;

 - the income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the period then ended;

 - the cash flow statement for the period then ended;

 - the statement of changes in equity for the period then ended; and

 - the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory
information.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted in the
European Union.

In applying the financial reporting framework, the Directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in
respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future
events.

_What an audit of financial statements involves_

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of:

 - whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and
adequately disclosed;

 - the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and

 - the overall presentation of the financial statements.

In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and financial statements (the
“Annual Report”) to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the
implications for our report.

**Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion, the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

_Directors’ remuneration_

preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.

Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 24 APRIL 2014

**1** **Accounting policies**

**General information**

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited operates short break holiday villages in Nottinghamshire, Cumbria,
Wiltshire and Suffolk.

The Company is a limited company, which is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered
office is One Edison Rise, New Ollerton, Newark, Nottinghamshire, NG22 9DP.

**Statement of compliance**

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations endorsed by
the European Union (EU) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under
IFRS.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. All
accounting policies are consistent with the prior period.

**Basis of preparation**

The financial statements have been prepared as a going concern under the historical cost convention.

The accounts of Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited are typically drawn up to the Thursday nearest to its
accounting reference date of 22 April.

The Company was, at the end of the period, a wholly-owned subsidiary of another company incorporated in the
EEA and in accordance with Section 400 of the Companies Act 2006, is not required to produce, and has not
published, consolidated accounts.

**Key assumptions and significant judgements**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates are principally used in the
following areas:

_Property, plant and equipment: Useful lives of assets and residual values (see accounting policy)._

_Impairment test for goodwill: Growth and discount rates (note 7)._

_Other intangible assets: Useful lives of assets and residual values (see accounting policy)._

_Retirement benefits: Actuarial assumptions in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme (note 18)._

**Revenue**

Revenue relates to one continuing activity, being the provision of short break holidays.

Revenue relates to villa rental income on holidays commenced during the period, together with other related income
that primarily arises from on-village leisure, retail and food and beverage spend. Non-rental income is recognised
when the related product or service is provided. All revenue is recorded net of VAT.

Payment for villa rental income is paid in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded as ‘payments on
account’ within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences.

A number of trading units on each holiday village are operated by concession partners. Revenue due in respect of
such units is recognised on a receivables basis.

All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are defined as those items that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency, warrant
separate disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the
Company.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is instead
tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is
allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.

**Other intangible assets**

_Software_

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the
specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is generally considered to be
four years.

Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as
incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products
controlled by the Company, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are
recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate
portion of relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their
estimated useful lives, which do not exceed four years.

**Impairment of assets**

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Where required, assets are discounted using an AAA corporate
bond rate. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).

**Property, plant and equipment**

Management chose the cost basis under IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’, rather than to apply the alternative
(revaluation) treatment to all items of property, plant and equipment as its ongoing accounting policy. The cost of
property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable costs.

Depreciation is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment (except assets in the course of
construction), so as to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful
economic life of the assets concerned, using the following rates:

Leasehold improvements . . . . . . 2.5% or by equal instalments over the period of the lease held on the land and
buildings, whichever is the shorter

Installations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.67% or by equal instalments over the period of the lease held on the land and
buildings, whichever is the shorter

Fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . 14% or by equal instalments over the period of the lease held on the land and
buildings, whichever is the shorter

Computer equipment . . . . . . . . . 25%

Motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25%

Useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and revised where expectations are
significantly different from previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for current and future periods
is adjusted accordingly.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 24 APRIL 2014

**Maintenance expenditure**

It is the policy of the Company to maintain its leasehold land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance
expenditure increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to generate, this expenditure is
capitalised. All other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

**Leases**

Leases are classified as finance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at cost and depreciated over their useful lives. The capital element
of future rentals is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged to the income statement over the period
of the lease in proportion to the capital outstanding.

Rental payments on operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor and including minimum
contractual rental increases) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.

**Investments in subsidiary undertakings**

Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for permanent diminution in value. If there are indications of
impairment, an assessment is made of the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income
statement when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value.

Dividends receivable from investments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised in the income statement when
approved by the shareholders of the company paying the dividend.

**Current and deferred tax**

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed
by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are
defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the
deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Inventories**

The basis of valuation of inventories is the lower of cost on a first in first out basis and estimated net realisable
value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable
selling expenses. Inventory provisions are created where necessary to ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of
cost and estimated net realisable value.

**Financial instruments**

The Company classifies its financial assets into two categories, being fair value through profit and loss, and loans
and receivables. Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial
liabilities. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this
designation at each reporting date.

Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Company provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no

F-219

intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade
and other receivables in the balance sheet.

**Financial assets**

The cost of investments, including loans to related parties, is their purchase cost together with any incremental costs
of acquisition. The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In deciding whether an impairment is required, the Directors
consider the underlying value inherent in the investment. Provision is made against the cost of investments where,
in the opinion of the Directors, there is an impairment in the value of the individual investment.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made
when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the
original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.

**Long-term receivables**

Where the effect is material, long-term receivables are discounted using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank
and in hand.

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**Early termination costs**

Costs associated with the early repayment of borrowings are written off to the income statement as incurred.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

**Government grants**

Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are categorised as accruals on receipt and are credited to the
income statement over the useful life of the relevant property, plant and equipment. The government grant included
in the balance sheet at the period end represents grants received to date, less the amount so far credited to the
income statement.

**Provisions**

Provisions for legal claims are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a
result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation,
and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is
determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an
outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations is small.

**Dividend distribution**

Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.

**Foreign currencies**

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. The resulting profit or loss, together with realised profits and losses arising during
the period on the settlement of overseas assets and liabilities, are included in the trading results.

**Employee benefits**

_Pensions_

—Defined contribution pension scheme

Company employees can choose to be a member of a defined contribution pension scheme. A defined contribution
pension scheme is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The
Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient
assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions
are charged to the income statement as incurred.

—Defined benefit pension scheme

A funded senior management defined benefit pension scheme also exists. A defined benefit pension scheme is a
pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

The surplus or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together
with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates for
high-quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.

Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Remeasurement gains and losses are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 24 APRIL 2014

These have not significantly impacted, and are not likely to have a future impact on, the financial statements of the
Company.

The audited financial statements for the period ended 25 April 2013 have not been restated for the adoption of
IAS 19 revised as the impact is not significant to the result or financial position.

The adoption of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which is expected to be enacted in 2018, is expected to change the
disclosure given in respect of financial instruments but not the amounts reported in the financial statements. In
addition, the International Accounting Standards Board and IFRIC have issued a number of further standards and
interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements. The Directors do not anticipate that
the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Company’s financial
statements in the period of initial application.

**2** **Financial risk management**

The Company finances its operations through a mixture of equity and borrowings as required. The Company has
historically sought to reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Company’s funding using the
underlying asset value.

The overall policy in respect of interest rates is to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

The Company does not actively trade in derivative financial instruments.

**Interest rate risk**

The Company has a floating rate mortgage and fixed rate loan notes as its only external funding sources. As at
24 April 2014, 99% (2013: 99%) of the Company’s external borrowings incurred interest at a fixed rate.

**Liquidity risk**

At 24 April 2014, the Company held sufficient levels of cash to enable it to meet its medium-term working capital
and funding obligations. Rolling forecasts of the Company’s liquidity requirements are prepared and monitored, and
surplus cash is invested in interest bearing accounts.

**Currency risk**

The Company is exposed to limited currency risk through foreign currency transactions. The Company does not
operate a hedging facility to manage currency risk as it is considered to be insignificant.

**Credit risk**

The Company borrows from well-established institutions with high credit ratings. The Company’s cash balances are
held on deposit with a number of UK banking institutions.

Change of corporation tax rate and factors that may affect future tax charges

The March 2013 Budget included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% with
effect from 1 April 2014 and to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. This legislation was substantively enacted for
financial reporting purposes on 2 July 2013 and hence has been reflected in these financial statements.

**Impairment test for goodwill**

Goodwill is allocated to the Company’s eight cash-generating units (CGUs), being the accommodation and on-site
revenue streams at each of the four villages. Goodwill by business stream is presented below:

**2014** **2013**
**£m** **£m**

**244.1** 244.1

The Directors consider that the economic characteristics and future expectations are materially consistent across
each of the villages within each business stream.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash
flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a one year period. Cash flows
beyond the one year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.

**Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations:**

The key assumptions of the value in use calculation are EBITDA margin, perpetual growth rate and discount rate
for each of on-site and accommodation. The growth rate used is 2.5% (2013: 2.5%) in respect of both on-site and
accommodation. The discount rate used is 7.73% (2013: 7.73%) in respect of both on-site and accommodation.

Management determine budgeted EBITDA margins based on past performance and expectations of market
development. The growth rates used reflect management’s expectations of the future market. Discount rates used
are pre-tax and reflect the specific risks to the Company.

The Directors believe that the carrying value of investments in subsidiary undertakings is supported by the
underlying net assets of the investee.

Center Parcs Limited made a pre-tax profit of £0.7 million for the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2014 (2013: profit of
£0.7 million) and its net assets at that date were £10.6 million (25 April 2013: £9.9 million).

A £2.9 million rental deposit was paid on the inception of the Longleat lease, repayable to the Company in the final
year of the lease. The fair value of the rental deposit above is calculated with reference to AAA Corporate Bond
rates. Rental deposits in respect of the Sherwood and Whinfell properties were repaid to the Company during the
prior period.

Amounts owed by Group undertakings include a loan of £198.5 million (2013: £198.5 million) due from Center
Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and the associated unpaid interest. Interest is receivable at a rate of 8% per annum and is
not compounded.

The remaining amounts owed by Group undertakings are trading balances and do not attract interest.

All amounts owed by Group undertakings are unsecured and repayable on demand.

The fair value of trade and other receivables is equal to its book value and no impairment provisions have been
made (2013: £nil). Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the vast majority
of customers paying in advance. As such there are no amounts past due as all amounts are current (2013: £nil).

All of the amounts above are denominated in £ sterling.

Company to repay the debt in advance of the expected maturity date. All tranches of debt are subject to a financial
covenant. The Directors have assessed future compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial
covenant.

£3.9 million (2013: £4.0 million) was accrued in respect of the loans in the period.

**Fair value hierarchy**

IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance
of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

All of the Company’s fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 2 and fair values are derived directly
from observable prices. There were no transfers between levels during the current or prior period.

**Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities**

The fair value of the Company’s gross securitised debt (before unamortised debt costs) at 24 April 2014 was £386.8
(2013: £395.7 million). The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities of the Company are approximately
equal to their book value.

**Maturity of financial liabilities**

The non-discounted minimum future cash flows in respect of non-current financial liabilities was:

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 APRIL 2013

**1** **Accounting policies**

**General information**

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited operates short break holiday villages in Nottinghamshire, Cumbria,
Wiltshire and Suffolk.

The Company is a limited company, which is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered
office is One Edison Rise, New Ollerton, Newark, Nottinghamshire, NG22 9DP.

**Statement of compliance**

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations endorsed by
the European Union (EU) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under
IFRS.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. All
accounting policies are consistent with the prior period.

**Basis of preparation**

The financial statements have been prepared as a going concern under the historical cost convention.

The accounts of Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited are typically drawn up to the Thursday nearest to its
accounting reference date of 22 April.

The Company was, at the end of the period, a wholly-owned subsidiary of another company incorporated in the
EEA and in accordance with Section 400 of the Companies Act 2006, is not required to produce, and has not
published, consolidated accounts.

**Key assumptions and significant judgements**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates are principally used in the
following areas:

_Property, plant and equipment:_ Useful lives of assets and residual values (see
accounting policy).

_Other intangible assets:_ Useful lives of assets and residual values (see
accounting policy).

_Rental deposits:_ Determination of the fair value of rental deposits
(note 11).

_Retirement benefits:_ Actuarial assumptions in respect of the defined benefit
pension scheme (note 21).

**Revenue recognition**

Revenue relates to one continuing activity, being the provision of short break holidays.

Revenue relates to villa rental income on holidays commenced during the period and other income, primarily arising
from on-village leisure, retail and food and beverage spend, and is shown after the deduction of value added tax.
Non-rental income is recognised when the related product or service is provided.

Villa rental income is paid in advance of the holiday commencing and is treated as ‘payments received on account’
until the holiday commences and it is recognised in the income statement.

Revenue due from concessions is recognised on a receivable basis.

All of the Company’s business is performed in the United Kingdom.

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 APRIL 2013

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is instead
tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is
allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.

**Other intangible assets**

_Software_

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the
specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is generally considered to be
four years.

Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as
incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products
controlled by the Company, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are
recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate
portion of relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their
estimated useful lives, which do not exceed four years.

**Financial instruments**

The Company classifies its financial assets into two categories, being fair value through profit and loss, and loans
and receivables. Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial
liabilities. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments and re-evaluates this designation at each
reporting date.

Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Company provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade
and other receivables in the balance sheet.

**Financial assets**

The cost of investments, including loans to associated companies, is their purchase cost together with any
incremental costs of acquisition.

The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a
group of financial assets is impaired. In deciding whether an impairment is required, the Directors consider the
underlying value inherent in the investment. Provision is made against the cost of investments where, in the opinion
of the Directors, there is an impairment in the value of the individual investment.

**Investments in subsidiary undertakings**

Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for permanent diminution in value. If there are indications of
impairment, an assessment is made of the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income
statement when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value.

Dividends receivable from investments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised in the income statement when
approved by the shareholders of the company paying the dividend.

**Maintenance expenditure**

It is the policy of the Company to maintain the leasehold land and buildings to a high standard, as expected by our
guests. Where maintenance expenditure increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to
generate, this expenditure is capitalised. All other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as
incurred.

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 APRIL 2013

**Leases**

Leases are classified as finance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at cost and depreciated over their useful lives. The capital element
of future rentals is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged to the income statement over the period
of the lease in proportion to the capital outstanding.

Rental payments on operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor and including minimum
contractual rental increases) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Management chose the cost basis under IAS 16 rather than apply the alternative (revaluation) treatment to all items
of property, plant and equipment as its ongoing accounting policy. The cost of property, plant and equipment
includes directly attributable costs.

Depreciation is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment (except assets in the course of
construction), so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less residual value, on a straight line basis
over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned, using the following rates:

Leasehold improvements 2.5% or by equal instalments over the period of the
lease held on the land and buildings, whichever is the
shorter

Installations 6.67% or by equal instalments over the period of the
lease held on the land and buildings, whichever is the
shorter

Fixtures and fittings 14%

Computer equipment 25%

Motor vehicles 25%

Useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and revised where expectations are
significantly different from previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for current and future periods
is adjusted accordingly.

**Government grants**

Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are categorised as accruals on receipt and are credited to the
income statement over the useful life of the relevant property, plant and equipment. The government grant shown in
the balance sheet at the period end represents grants received to date, less the amount so far credited to profit.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank,
cash in hand and overnight deposits.

**Provisions**

Provisions for legal claims are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a
result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation,
and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is
determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an
outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations is small.

**Impairment of assets**

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an

F-244

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 APRIL 2013

asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Where required, assets are discounted using an AAA corporate
bond rate. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).

**Inventories**

The basis of valuation of inventories is the lower of cost on a first in first out basis and estimated net realisable
value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable
selling expenses. Inventory provisions are created where necessary to ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of
cost and estimated net realisable value.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made
when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the
original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.

**Long-term receivables**

Where the effect is material, long-term receivables are discounted using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are included in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are defined as those items that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency, warrant
separate disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the
Company.

**Dividend distribution**

Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.

**Current and deferred tax**

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed
by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are
defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or
the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Employee benefits**

_Pensions_

—Defined contribution pension scheme

Company employees can choose to be a member of a defined contribution pension scheme. A defined contribution
pension scheme is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The
Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient

assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions
are charged to the income statement as incurred.

—Defined benefit pension scheme

A funded senior management defined benefit pension scheme also exists. A defined benefit pension scheme is a
pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

The surplus or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together
with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates for
high-quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.

Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_Profit-sharing and bonus plans_

The Company recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes
into consideration the profit attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Company
recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive
obligation.

_Holiday pay_

The Company recognises an appropriate liability for the cost of holiday entitlements not taken at the balance sheet
date.

**Foreign currencies**

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. The resulting profit or loss, together with realised profits and losses arising during
the period on the settlement of overseas assets and liabilities, are included in the trading results.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transactions costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**Early termination costs**

Costs associated with the early repayment of borrowings are written off to the income statement as incurred.

**New standards and interpretations**

The adoption of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is expected to change the disclosure given in respect of financial
instruments but not the amounts reported in the financial statements. In addition, the International Accounting
Standards Board and IFRIC have issued a number of further standards and interpretations with an effective date
after the date of these financial statements. The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and
interpretations will have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements in the period of initial application.

Center Parcs (Operating Company) Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 APRIL 2013

**2** **Financial risk management**

The Company finances its operations through a mixture of shareholders’ funds, bank and other borrowings and loan
notes as required. The Company has historically sought to reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring
the Company’s funding using the underlying asset value.

The overall policy in respect of interest rates is to reduce the exposure to floating rates.

The Company currently has no derivative financial instruments. It is not the Company’s policy to actively trade in
derivative financial instruments.

**Interest rate risk**

The Company has a floating rate mortgage and fixed rate loan notes as its only external funding sources. The
Company does not have a definitive stance on the balance between fixed and floating rate debt. As at 25 April 2013,
99% of the Company’s external borrowings incurred interest at a fixed rate.

**Liquidity risk**

At 25 April 2013, the Company held in place sufficient cash levels to ensure that the Company has available funds
to meet its medium-term working capital and funding obligations.

**Currency risk**

The Company is exposed to limited currency risk through foreign currency transactions. The Company does not
operate a hedging facility to manage the currency risks as they are considered to be insignificant.

**Credit risk**

The Company borrows from well-established institutions with high credit ratings. The Company’s cash balances are
held on deposit with UK banking institutions.

trustees of the scheme who act independently from the management of the Company. The aggregate fees paid to the
auditors for these services during the period were £5,000 (2012: £4,750).

The Directors monitor the level of non-audit work undertaken by the auditors and ensure it is work which they are
best suited to perform and does not present a risk to their independence and objectivity.

Change of corporation tax rate and factors that may affect future tax charges

Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 was included
in the Finance Act 2012. The announcement was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and hence has been
reflected in these financial statements.

Further reductions to the UK corporation tax rate have been announced which propose to reduce the rate to 21%
from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015. These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date and therefore are not recognised in these financial statements.

**Impairment test for goodwill**

Goodwill is allocated to the Company’s eight cash-generating units (CGUs), being the accommodation and on-site
revenue streams at each of the four villages. Goodwill by business stream is presented below:

**2013** **2012**
**£m** **£m**

**244.1** 244.1

The Directors consider that the economic characteristics and future expectations are materially consistent across
each of the villages within each business stream.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash
flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a one year period. Cash flows
beyond the one year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.

**Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations:**

The key assumptions of the value in use calculation are EBITDA margin, perpetual growth rate and discount rate
for each of on-site and accommodation. The growth rate used is 2.5% (2012: 2.5%) in respect of both on-site and
accommodation. The discount rate used is 7.73% (2012: 7.73%) in respect of both on-site and accommodation.

Management determine budgeted EBITDA margins based on past performance and expectations of market
development. The growth rates used reflect management’s expectations of the future market. Discount rates used
are pre-tax and reflect the specific risks to the Company.

**Fair value hierarchy**

IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance
of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

All of the Company’s fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 2 in both the current and prior
periods. There were no transfers between levels during the current or prior periods.

**Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities**

The fair value of the Company’s gross securitised debt (before unamortised debt costs) at 25 April 2013 was
£395.7 million. Given the proximity of the Company’s prior period end to the transaction that occurred on
28 February 2012, the fair value of borrowings at 26 April 2012 was not considered to be materially different to the
book value. The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities of the Company are approximately equal to their
book value.

**Maturity of financial liabilities**

The non-discounted minimum future cash flows in respect of non-current financial liabilities was:
