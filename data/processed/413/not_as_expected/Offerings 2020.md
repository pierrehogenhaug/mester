**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION DATED 7 SEPTEMBER 2020**

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION**
**CONFIDENTIAL** **IN THE UNITED STATES**


###### CPUK Finance Limited
(incorporated in Jersey with limited liability under registration number 108635)

£250,000,000   % Class B5 Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2050
CPUK Finance Limited (the “Issuer”), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Jersey, is offering £250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of    % Class B5
Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2050 (the “Class B5 Notes” or the “Offered Notes”).

Interest on the Class B5 Notes will accrue at a rate of    % per annum (the “Class B5 Note Interest Rate”) from (and including) the issue date to (but excluding) 28 August 2026
(“Class B5 Note Step-Down Date”) and thereafter will accrue at a rate of    % per annum. Interest on the Class B5 Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on 28 February and 28 August
(subject to adjustment as specified herein for non-Business Days) (each, a “Note Interest Payment Date”) in each year commencing on 28 February 2021. The Issuer’s obligations to pay principal
and interest on the Class B5 Notes are intended to be met from the payments by the Borrowers of principal and interest in the corresponding periods on £250,000,000 Class B5 Loan (as defined herein)
granted by the Issuer to the Borrowers on the issue date of the Offered Notes pursuant to the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (each as defined herein). If on any Note Interest
Payment Date, the amount received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B5 Loan is not sufficient to pay the interest accrued on the Class B5 Notes during the immediately
preceding Note Interest Period in full, the amount of interest accrued up to any such Note Interest Payment Date that is not paid by the Issuer on such Note Interest Payment Date will be deferred (any
such accrued but deferred interest, being a “Deferred Interest Amount”) and such Deferred Interest Amount shall continue to accrue interest at the then applicable Class B5 Note Interest Rate until it
is paid by the Issuer in full. Interest paid on the Class B5 Loans will be payable in cash on each Loan Interest Payment Date (as defined herein) to (but not including) 25 August 2026 (the “Class B5
**Loan Expected Maturity Date”) and thereafter accruing interest shall be deferred.**

The Class B5 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full on 28 August 2026 (the “Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date”). The Class B5 Notes will be subject to mandatory redemption
and/or may be subject to optional redemption before such dates in certain circumstances, including if and to the extent the Borrowers make principal repayments or prepayments to the Issuer in respect
of the Class B5 Loan. See “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes — Condition 5 (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation)”.

The Borrowers may prepay the Class B5 Loan in whole or in part at any time on or after 28 August 2022 at the prepayment prices specified herein. Prior to 28 August 2022, the Borrowers
may prepay the Class B5 Loan in whole or in part at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts, if any, up to the
prepayment date plus the applicable “make-whole” premium, as described herein. Prior to 28 August 2022, the Borrowers may prepay up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Class B5
Loan in each calendar year at a prepayment price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Class B5 Loan prepaid. In addition, prior to 28 August 2022, the Borrowers may use the net proceeds of
specified equity offerings to prepay up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Class B5 Loan at a prepayment price equal to    % of the principal amount of the Class B5 Loan prepaid, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts, if any, up to the prepayment date, provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Class B5 Loan remains outstanding
following the prepayment. Additionally, the Borrowers may prepay all, but not less than all, of the Class B5 Loan at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, up to the prepayment date upon the occurrence of certain changes in
applicable tax law. Upon certain events constituting a change of control, the Borrowers may be required to make an offer to repurchase all the Class B5 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, up to the purchase date.
In the event of any prepayment by the Borrowers of the Class B5 Loan, in whole or in part, the Issuer will be required to apply the proceeds received from such prepayment to redeem a corresponding
principal amount of Class B5 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, at a redemption
price corresponding to the applicable prepayment price set forth in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Class B5 Notes, if holders of
not less than 90 per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B5 Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Class B5 Notes in such tender offer and a Borrower purchases all
of the Class B5 Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Borrowers may prepay the remaining principal amount of the Class B5 Loan, in whole, but not in part, at a price equal to the
purchase price offered to holders of the Class B5 Notes pursuant to such tender offer and the Issuer will be required to apply the proceeds received from such prepayment to redeem a corresponding
principal amount of Class B5 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, at a redemption
price corresponding to the prepayment price.

The Offered Notes will rank pari passu with the Class B3 Notes, a portion of which will be refinanced with the proceeds of the Offered Notes, and the Class B4 Notes. The Offered
Notes will be contractually subordinated to, among others, the Class A Notes (as defined herein) and will not be guaranteed by any person, except that the Offered Notes will benefit indirectly from
the Topco Payment Undertaking (as defined below). The Class B Loans (as defined herein) are contractually subordinated to, among others, the Class A Loans (as defined herein), the Liquidity Facility
(as defined herein) and certain hedging arrangements, as described further herein. The Class B Loans are guaranteed by the Borrowers and certain subsidiaries of CP Cayman Midco 2 Limited
(“Topco”), as further described herein. Pursuant to an amended and restated deed of undertaking entered into on the Fourth Closing Date (the “Topco Payment Undertaking”), Topco has
undertaken to procure payment of all principal, interest and other amounts outstanding under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in the circumstances described herein, including in the
event that the Class B5 Loan is not repaid in full on the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date.

The Offered Notes will be secured by substantially all the Issuer’s property and assets (including its rights against each Obligor under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement),
which security will also be shared with, among others, the Class A Notes. The Offered Notes will rank junior to the Class A Notes with respect to the application of enforcement proceeds, other than
in respect of the Topco Security. The Class B Loans rank junior to the Class A Loans, the Liquidity Facility and certain hedging arrangements with respect to the application of enforcement proceeds,
other than in respect of the Topco Security (as defined herein). The Topco Payment Undertaking is secured by first-ranking security in respect of all the issued and outstanding shares of CP Cayman
Limited and of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited, together with a floating charge over all of Topco and CP Cayman Limited’s assets, as further described herein. The Topco Security has been granted
for the sole benefit of holders of the Class B Notes.

Application has been made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the Offered Notes to be admitted to the Official List (the “Official List”) of
The International Stock Exchange (the "Exchange"). No assurance can be given that the application will be granted. Furthermore, admission of the Offered Notes to the Official List is not an indication
of the merits of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Offered Notes. There can be no assurance that Offered Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that permission to deal in the
Offered Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. Carey Olsen Corporate Finance Limited is acting solely in its capacity as listing agent for the Issuer in relation to the Class B5
Notes and is not itself seeking admission of the Class B5 Notes to the Official List.

The issue price of the Class B5 Notes is   %


**Investing in the Offered Notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 34.**


**The Offered Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or the securities laws of any other**
**jurisdiction. Subject to certain exceptions, the Offered Notes may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States, or for the account or benefit of, or to any U.S. persons (as**
**defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act). Accordingly, the Offered Notes are being offered and sold only outside the United States to persons who are not U.S. persons in**
**accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions” for additional information about eligible offerees and transfer restrictions.**

Corporate Services Provider and the Issuer Jersey Corporate Services Provider (each, an “Other Party” and together the
“Other Parties”) as to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum or any
other information supplied in connection with the Offered Notes or their distribution. The statements made in this
paragraph are without prejudice to the respective responsibilities of the Issuer and the Obligors. Each person receiving
this Offering Memorandum acknowledges that such person has not relied on any of the Other Parties nor on any person
affiliated with any of them in connection with its investigation of the accuracy of such information or its investment
decision.

The Issuer accepts responsibility for the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. To the best of
the knowledge and belief of the Issuer (having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case), the information
contained in this Offering Memorandum is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the
import of such information.

Each of the Obligors accept responsibility for the information set out in the sections entitled “Presentation of
_Financial Information”, “Trademarks”, “Risk Factors”, “Capitalisation”, “Selected Consolidated Financial_
_Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Industry”,_
“Business”, “Management”, “Principal Shareholder”, “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions”,
“Principal Obligors” and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.
To the best of the Obligors’ knowledge and belief (having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case) the
information in the relevant sections is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the
accuracy of such information.

This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to subscribe for or purchase
any of the Offered Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation is not authorized or to any person to whom
it is unlawful to make such an offer or invitation. You must comply with all laws that apply to you in any place in which
you buy, offer or sell any Offered Notes or possess this Offering Memorandum. You must also obtain any consents or
approvals that you need in order to purchase any Offered Notes. None of the Issuer or the Class B Global Coordinators
and Joint Bookrunners are responsible for your compliance with these legal requirements.

The Offered Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold
except as permitted under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws pursuant to registration thereunder or
exemption therefrom. See “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions”. You should be aware that you may be
required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time.

On issue, it is expected that the Offered Notes will be assigned the respective ratings of Standard & Poor’s
Credit Market Services Europe Limited (“S&P”) and Fitch Ratings Ltd. (“Fitch” and, together with S&P, the “Rating
**Agencies” and each, a “Rating Agency”). As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, both Rating Agencies are**
established in the European Union and are registered under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 (the “CRA Regulation”). As
such, each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by the European Securities and
Markets Authority on its website in accordance with the CRA Regulation. A credit rating is not a recommendation to
buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating
organisation. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal of any rating may adversely affect the market price of such
securities.

A copy of this Offering Memorandum has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies in Jersey in
accordance with Article 5 of the Companies (General Provisions) (Jersey) Order 2002 and he has given, and has not
withdrawn, his consent to its circulation.

The Jersey Financial Services Commission has given, and has not withdrawn, or will have given prior to the
issuance of the Offered Notes and not withdrawn, its consent under Article 4 of the Control of Borrowing (Jersey) Order
1958 to the issuance of the Offered Notes.

It must be distinctly understood that, in giving these consents, neither the Registrar of Companies in Jersey nor
the Jersey Financial Services Commission takes any responsibility for the financial soundness of the Issuer or for the
correctness of any statements made, or opinion expressed, with regard to it.

The Jersey Financial Services Commission is protected by the Control of Borrowing (Jersey) Law 1947, as
amended, against liability arising from the discharge of its functions under that law.

It should be remembered that the price of securities and the income from them can go down as well as up.

If you are in any doubt about the contents of this Offering Memorandum you should consult your stockbroker,
bank manager, solicitor, accountant or other financial adviser.

The Issuer expects that delivery of the Offered Notes will be made on the respective Offered Notes on or about
September 2020, which will be the      business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the
Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Offered Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”
(U.S.)). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two
business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.

In connection with the issuance of the Offered Notes, Barclays Bank PLC (the “Stabilisation Manager”) or
any person acting on its behalf may, to the extent permitted by all applicable laws, regulations, rules and directives, overallot and effect transactions in any over-the-counter market or otherwise in connection with the distribution of the
Offered Notes with a view to supporting the market price of the Offered Notes at a level higher than that which might
otherwise prevail. However, there is no assurance that the Stabilisation Manager (or any agent of the Stabilisation
Manager) will undertake any stabilisation action. Any stabilisation action may begin on or after the date on which
adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the Offered Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time,
but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issuance of the Offered Notes and 60 days after the date of
allotment of the Offered Notes and must be brought to an end after a limited period in compliance with applicable laws,
regulations and rules.

This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to subscribe for or purchase
any of the Offered Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation is not authorized or to any person to whom
it is unlawful to make such an offer or invitation. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this
Offering Memorandum and the offer and sale of the Offered Notes. Persons into whose possession this Offering
Memorandum or any of the Offered Notes are delivered must inform themselves about and observe those restrictions.
Each prospective purchaser of the Offered Notes must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any
jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers or sells the Offered Notes or possesses or distributes this Offering
Memorandum. In addition, each prospective purchaser must obtain any consent, approval or permission required under
the regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it purchases, offers or sells the Offered Notes.
We, the Issuer and the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners shall not have any responsibility for obtaining
such consent, approval or permission.

The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or
regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisors to determine whether and to
what extent (1) the Offered Notes are legal investments for it; (2) the Offered Notes can be used as security for
indebtedness; and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any of the Offered Notes. Financial institutions

should consult their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of the Offered
Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

The information contained under “Exchange Rate Information” includes extracts from information and data
publicly released by official and other sources. While the Issuer accepts responsibility for accurately summarizing the
information concerning exchange rate information, the Issuer accepts no further responsibility in respect of such
information.

**Volcker Rule**

Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and Regulation VV (12 C.F.R.
Section 248) promulgated thereunder by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (such statutory provision
together with such implementing regulations, the “Volcker Rule”) generally prohibit “banking entities” (which term is
broadly defined to include any U.S. bank or savings association whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, any company that controls any such bank or savings association, any foreign bank treated as a
bank holding company for purposes of Section 8 of the International Banking Act of 1978, as amended, and any affiliate
or subsidiary of any of the foregoing entities) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading as defined in the Volcker Rule,
(ii) acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in or sponsoring a “covered fund” and (iii) entering into certain
relationships with such funds. The Volcker Rule became effective on 21 July 2012, and final regulations implementing
the Volcker Rule were adopted on 10 December 2013 and became effective on 1 April 2014. Compliance with the
Volcker Rule and its implementing regulations was required by 21 July 2015 (subject to the possibility of up to two oneyear extensions). Under the Volcker Rule, unless otherwise jointly determined otherwise by specified federal regulators,
a “covered fund” does not include an issuer that may rely on an exclusion or exemption from the definition of
“investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”),
other than those contained in Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.

In 2018, the five bank regulatory agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule issued proposed
amendments to the Volcker Rule regulations not relevant to securitizations, but also asked for comment on potential
future modifications to the Volcker Rule regulations, including modifications to the definition of “covered fund”, to the
requirements of the “loan securitization” exclusion and to the nature of a prohibited “ownership interest” in a covered
fund. On 30 January 2020, these five agencies published proposed revisions (the “Proposed Volcker Changes”) based
upon the 2018 request for comments. Among other proposals, the Proposed Volcker Changes include modifications to (i)
permit covered funds relying on the “loan securitization” exclusion to acquire assets that do not constitute loans or other
assets or rights currently permitted under the “loan securitization” exclusion, in an aggregate amount not to exceed 5% of
the aggregate value of the issuing entity’s assets, (ii) exclude from the definition of “ownership interest” certain “senior
loans” or “senior debt interests” issued by a covered fund and (iii) clarify that the rights either to participate in the
removal or replacement of an investment manager for cause (in connection with, among other things, the bankruptcy,
insolvency, conservatorship or receivership of the investment manager, the breach by the investment manager of any
material provision of the covered fund’s transaction agreements applicable to the investment manager, the breach by the
investment manager of material representations or warranties, the occurrence of an act that constitutes fraud or criminal
activity in the performance of the investment manager’s obligations under the covered fund’s transaction agreements, the
indictment of the investment manager for a criminal offense, or the indictment of any officer, member, partner or other
principal of the investment manager for a criminal offense materially related to his or her investment management
activities, a change in control with respect to the investment manager, and the loss, separation or incapacitation of an
individual critical to the operation of the investment manager or primarily responsible for the management of the covered
fund’s assets) would not be a feature that results in a banking entity having an ownership interest in a covered fund.

On 25 June 2020, the five agencies adopted the bulk of the Proposed Volcker Changes (but with some
modifications), and these changes will be effective as of 1 October 2020.

The Issuer is not, and after giving effect to any offering and sale of the Offered Notes and the application of
the proceeds thereof will not be, a “covered fund” for purposes of the Volcker Rule. In reaching this conclusion, the
Issuer has determined that the Issuer will not rely solely on Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company
Act for its exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act.

The general effects of the Volcker Rule (including the changes adopted in June 2020) remain uncertain. Any
prospective investor in the Offered Notes, including a U.S. or foreign bank or a subsidiary or other affiliate thereof,
should consult its own legal advisors regarding such matters and other effects of the Volcker Rule.

**Notice to U.S. Investors**

**The Offered Notes have not been registered, approved or disapproved by the U.S. Securities and**
**Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), any state securities commission in the United States or any other U.S.**

iv


-----

**regulatory authority, nor have any of the foregoing authorities passed upon or endorsed the merits of the Offered**
**Notes or the accuracy or the adequacy of this Offering Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a**
**criminal offence in the United States.**

Each purchaser of the Offered Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and
acknowledgments that are described in this Offering Memorandum under “Notice to Investors and Transfer
_Restrictions”. The Offered Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or with any securities_
regulatory authority of any other jurisdiction. The Offered Notes may be offered, sold or delivered only outside the
United States to persons who are not “U.S. persons” as defined in Regulation S (each, a “U.S. person”) in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S.

**Notice to Investors in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Offered Notes in any member
states of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or in the United Kingdom (each a “Relevant State”) will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the
Offered Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the United Kingdom and/or the
EEA of the Offered Notes which are subject of the offering contemplated in this Offering Memorandum must only do so
in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer, the Obligors or any of the Class B Global Coordinators and
Joint Bookrunners to produce a prospectus for such offer. None of the Issuer, the Obligors nor any of the Class B Global
Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners has authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of the Offered Notes
through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners
which constitute the final placement of the Offered Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum. The expression
“Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament (in relation to the UK, as it
forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018), and includes any relevant
implementing measure in the Relevant State.

In relation to each Relevant State, no offer has been made and no offer will be made of the Offered Notes to
the public in that Relevant State prior to the publication of a prospectus in relation to the Offered Notes that has been
approved by the competent authority in that Relevant State or, where appropriate, approved in another Relevant State and
notified to the competent authority in that Member State, all in accordance with the Prospectus Regulation, except that an
offer of the Offered Notes may be made to the public in that Relevant State at any time to:

(a) “qualified investors” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation;

(b) fewer than 150, natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus
Regulation) in any Relevant State subject to obtaining the prior consent of the Issuer; or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 1(4) of the Prospectus Regulation,

provided that no such offer of the Offered Notes shall result in a requirement for the publication by the

Issuers of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression “offer of the Offered Notes to the public” in relation to any
Offered Notes in any Relevant State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information
on the terms of the offer and the Offered Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or
subscribe for the Offered Notes.

**Prohibition of Sales to United Kingdom and EEA Retail Investors**

The Offered Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom or the EEA. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (“MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (“Insurance
**Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of**
Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
Offered Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom or the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the Offered Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in
the United Kingdom or the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**MIFID II product governance / target market**

v


-----

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Offered Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Offered Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the
Offered Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending the Offered Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Offered Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum is directed solely at persons who (i) are investment professionals, as such term is
defined in Article 19(5) of the Financial Promotion Order, (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net

Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning
of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of any
Offered Notes may otherwise be lawfully communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being
referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not
relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relate is available only to
relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. Any person who is not a relevant person should not
act or rely on this Offering Memorandum or any of its contents. The Offered Notes are not being offered to the public in
the United Kingdom.

**Germany**

The offering of the Offered Notes is not a public offering in the Federal Republic of Germany (“Germany”).
In Germany, the Offered Notes may only be offered and sold in accordance with the provisions of the Securities
Prospectus Act of the Federal Republic of Germany (the “Securities Prospectus Act, Wertpapierprospektgesetz,
**_WpPG”) and any other applicable German law. No application has been made under German law to offer the Offered_**
Notes to the public in or out of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Offered Notes are not registered or authorized for
distribution under the Securities Prospectus Act and accordingly may not be, and are not being, offered or advertised
publicly or by public promotion. This Offering Memorandum is strictly for private use and the offer is only being made
to recipients to whom this Offering Memorandum is personally addressed and does not constitute an offer or
advertisement to the public. The Issuer has not, and does not intend to, file a securities prospectus with the German
Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (“BaFin”) or obtain a notification to BaFin from another competent authority of
a Member State, with which a securities prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to Section 17 para. 3 of the Securities
Prospectus Act. In Germany, the Offered Notes will only be available to, and this Offering Memorandum and any other
offering material in relation to the Offered Notes is directed only at, persons who are qualified investors (qualifizierte
_Anleger) within the meaning of Section 2 No. 6 of the Securities Prospectus Act or who are subject of another exemption_
in accordance with Section 3 para. 2 of the Securities Prospectus Act. Any resale of the Offered Notes in Germany may
only be made in accordance with the Securities Prospectus Act and other applicable laws.

**Austria**

The Offered Notes may only be offered in the Republic of Austria in compliance with the provisions of the
Austrian Capital Market Act (Kapitalmarktgesetz) and other laws applicable in the Republic of Austria governing the
offer and sale of the Offered Notes in the Republic of Austria. The Offered Notes have not been registered or otherwise
authorized for a public offer under either the Austrian Capital Market Act (Kapitalmarktgesetz), the Investment Fund Act
2011 (Investmentfondsgesetz 2011) or any other Austrian securities law in Austria. Neither this Offering Memorandum
nor any other document in connection with the Offered Notes is a prospectus according to the Austrian Capital
Market Act (Kapitalmarktgesetz), the Stock Exchange Act (Börsegesetz) or the Investment Fund Act 2011
(Investmentfondsgesetz 2011) and has therefore not been drawn up, audited, approved, passported and/or published in
accordance with the aforesaid acts. In Austria, the Offered Notes will only be available to, and this Offering
Memorandum and any other selling material relating to the Offered Notes is directed only at, persons who are qualified
investors (qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of section 1 para. 1 No. 5a of the Austrian Capital Market Act
(Kapitalmarktgesetz). The recipients of this Offering Memorandum and other selling material with respect to the Offered
Notes have been individually selected and identified before the offer is made and are targeted exclusively on the basis of
a private placement. Accordingly, the Offered Notes may not be, and are not being, offered or advertised publicly or
offered similarly in the Republic of Austria. No offer will be made to any persons in Austria other than the recipients to
whom this Offering Memorandum is personally addressed. This Offering Memorandum is distributed under the condition
that the foregoing obligations are accepted by the recipient and that the recipient undertakes to comply with the above
selling and transfer restrictions.

This Offering Memorandum, as well as any other material relating to the Offered Notes which are the subject
of the offering contemplated by this Offering Memorandum, do not constitute an issue prospectus pursuant to article
652a and/or article 1156 of the Swiss Code of Obligations and may not comply with the Directive for Notes of Foreign
Borrowers of the Swiss Bankers Association. The Offered Notes will not be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange Ltd, and,
therefore, the documents relating to the Offered Notes, including, but not limited to, this Offering Memorandum, do not
claim to comply with the disclosure standards of the Swiss Code of Obligations and the listing rules of SIX Swiss

intention to distribute them to the public. The investors will be individually approached directly from time to time. This

forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believes”, “estimates”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”,
“may”, “will” or “should” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. These forwardlooking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this
Offering Memorandum and include statements regarding the intentions, beliefs or current expectations of the Center
Parcs Group concerning, among other things, the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth,
strategies of the Center Parcs Group and the industry in which the Center Parcs Group operates.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and
depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. The Center Parcs Group believes that these risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum.
These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary

condition and liquidity of the Center Parcs Group, and the development of the industry in which the Center Parcs Group
operates, are consistent with the forward-looking statements set out in this Offering Memorandum, those results or
developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Many factors could cause the
Center Parcs Group’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements including, but not
limited to:

        - the development, impact and aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic;

manner;

         - any other risk factors listed in this Offering Memorandum.

The above list is not exhaustive and should be considered together with the risks described under “Risk
_Factors”._

Any forward-looking statements which are made in this Offering Memorandum speak only as of the date
thereof. There can be no assurance that Center Parcs’ actual results will not differ materially from the expectations set
forth in such forward-looking statements. The Issuer and the Center Parcs Group expressly disclaim any obligation or

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**Historical Financial Information**

The financial information presented and discussed in this Offering Memorandum, unless otherwise indicated,
has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited as at and for
each of the 52-week periods ended 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 and the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, in
each case prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union
(“IFRS”), included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The financial information as at and for the period ended
26 April 2018 has been derived from the comparative period included in the audited consolidated financial statements as
at and for the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019.

The audited consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited as at and for the 52-week
period ended 23 April 2020 (the “2020 Audited Financial Statements”), the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and
the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum have been audited by Deloitte
LLP, independent auditor, as stated in their reports included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The audit reports,
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, express an unqualified opinion for each of the respective periods and
the audit report in relation to the 2020 Audited Financial Statements includes a material uncertainty paragraph related to
going concern as set forth in Note 1 to such financial statements. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Paragraph on
_Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern in Audit Report.”_

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited adopted IFRS 16, Leases (“IFRS 16”) in the 52-week period ended 25
April 2019 and recognised £2.2 million as a reduction in retained earnings as a result of the adoption. Center Parcs
(Holdings 1) Limited early adopted IFRS 16 by applying the modified retrospective approach, which requires the
cumulative effect of the initial application of IFRS 16 to be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of
retained earnings on 27 April 2018, the date of initial application, without restating prior periods. On adoption of
IFRS 16, right of use assets and lease liabilities were brought onto the balance sheet for £30.9 million and £33.1 million,
respectively, and related depreciation charges and finance expense are recognised in the income statement, instead of
operating lease rentals expenses.

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“IFRS
**15”) in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 using the retrospective method and restating the comparative periods.**
The effect of adoption of IFRS 15 as at 20 April 2017 was the deferral of £0.8 million of revenue in respect of certain
promotional activities that was recognised as a liability at the transition date with a corresponding reduction to retained
earnings.

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (“IFRS 9”) in the 52 weeks
period ended 25 April 2019 and in accordance with the standard, the comparative periods were not restated. The adoption
of IFRS 9 on 27 April 2018 did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs
(Holdings 1) Limited.

As a result of the adoption of the above accounting standards, the audited consolidated financial statements as
at and for each of the 52-week periods ended 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 are not directly comparable with the
audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, included in this Offering
Memorandum. The audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018 were
prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 18, Revenue, IAS 17, Leases and IAS 39,
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, which were the standards applicable at that time.

**Unaudited “as adjusted” financial information**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain financial information as adjusted to reflect the impact of the
Transactions as at and for the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020 and for the 52-week period from 1 March 2019 to
27 February 2020. For more information on financial information for the 52-week period from 1 March 2019 to 27
February 2020 and applicable adjustments, see “—Reporting Terms” below. The “as adjusted” financial data has been
included to illustrate the effect of the Transactions on the consolidated balance sheet of Center Parcs as if the
Transactions had occurred on 23 April 2020, and to illustrate the effect of the Transactions on the consolidated income
statement of Center Parcs as if the Transactions had occurred on 26 April 2019 or, where indicated, on 1 March 2019.
The financial information for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020 has not been prepared in accordance with IAS
34 Interim Financial Reporting and has not been audited or reviewed. Moreover, as certain year-end procedures were not
performed in preparing the financial information for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, it may not represent
the same financial information that would have resulted if Center Parcs had produced year-end financial statements for
the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. See “—Reporting Terms” below. The “as adjusted” financial information
has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, or any

generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting adjusted
financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. The
“as adjusted” financial data is presented for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered a presentation of the
actual results of operations that would have been attained had the Transactions actually occurred at an earlier date or in
an earlier period.

The “as adjusted” financial data should be read in conjunction with the information presented in “Use of
_Proceeds”, “Capitalisation” and the audited Center Parcs consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this_
Offering Memorandum.

**Reporting Terms**

The financial year of Center Parcs is divided into 13 four-week periods (in a 53-week financial year, 12 fourweek periods and one five-week period) to enable more meaningful conclusions to be drawn when periods are compared
as all accounting periods contain the same number of days and an equal number of weekend and mid-week breaks. For
existing quarterly reporting purposes, Center Parcs reports at the end of periods three, six, nine and thirteen. This
reporting corresponds to three periods of 12 weeks and one period of 16 weeks in each financial year (17 weeks in a 53week financial year). The 2019 and 2020 financial years were 52-week periods; however the 2018 financial year was a
53-week period. Consequently, unless otherwise indicated, the financial information for the 2018 financial year includes
an additional week, which affects the comparability of results of operations between periods.

References in this Offering Memorandum to:

        - “Financial year 2020” or the “2020 financial year” are to the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020;

         - “Financial year 2019” or the “2019 financial year” are to the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019;
and

         - “Financial year 2018” or the “2018 financial year” are to the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018.

During the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020, the Center Parcs villages were closed from 20 March 2020 to
the end of the period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to facilitate comparability to the 52-week period ended
25 April 2019 and the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, certain financial and operational information is presented as
of and for the 52-week period from 1 March 2019 to 27 February 2020, which represents the last 52-week period for which
management accounts are available and during which all villages were open and operational. Figures for the 52 week period
from 1 March 2019 to 27 February 2020 are calculated by adding together the results from the 52-week period ended
25 April 2019 to the results from 26 April 2019 to 27 February 2020 and deducting the results from 27 April 2018 to
28 February 2019. In addition, certain comparative figures are also presented as of and for the 52-week period from
2 March 2018 to 28 February 2019. These comparative figures are calculated by adding together the results from the 53week period ended 26 April 2018 to the results from 27 April 2018 to 28 February 2019 and deducting the results from
21 April 2017 to 22 February 2018 and the 53-week Adjustment for the 2018 financial year. The 53-week adjustment for
the financial year 2018 has been calculated by dividing the financial results for the four-week period from 23 February 2018
to 22 March 2018 by four (to represent financial results for a typical off-peak one-week period of financial results) (the
“53-week Adjustment”) and subtracting the 53-week Adjustment from the results for the financial year ended 26 April
2018.The financial information for the 52-week periods ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019 has been extracted
from management accounts. The financial information for the 52-week periods ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February
2019 has not been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and has not been audited or reviewed.
Moreover, as certain year-end procedures were not performed in preparing the financial information for the 52-week
periods ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019, they may not represent the same financial information that would
have resulted if Center Parcs had produced year-end financial statements for the 52-week periods ended 27 February 2020
and 28 February 2019, respectively.

The financial years ended 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 were 52-week periods; however, the financial year
ended 26 April 2018 was a 53-week period. This may impact comparability to the 52-week periods ended 23 April 2020
and 25 April 2019.

**_Non-IFRS Financial and Operating Measures_**

_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios, including EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA before exceptional and non-underlying items (referred to as Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, in
this Offering Memorandum) and leverage and coverage ratios, that are not required by, or presented in accordance with,
IFRS. These measures are not measures of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited’s consolidated financial performance or

xiv


-----

liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to (a) operating profit or profit/(loss) for the period as
a measure of operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of
Center Parcs’ ability to meet their cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance under IFRS.

Center Parcs defines EBITDA as profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders before interest,
taxation, depreciation and amortisation. Center Parcs defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA as defined above, further
adjusted to remove the effects of certain exceptional and non-underlying items that Center Parcs believes are not
indicative of its underlying operating performance. Center Parcs believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful
indicators of Center Parcs’ ability to incur and service its indebtedness and may assist investors, security analysts and
other interested parties in evaluating Center Parcs’ financial performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as the
primary profit measure to assess the performance of the operating segments and discloses it within the consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. As all companies do not calculate EBITDA or
Adjusted EBITDA on a consistent basis, Center Parcs’ presentation of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA may not be
comparable to measures under the same or similar names used by other companies. Accordingly, undue reliance should
not be placed on EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in this Offering Memorandum. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have
limitations as analytical tools and investors should not consider them in isolation. Some of these limitations are that:

        - they do not reflect Center Parcs’ cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments;

         - they do not reflect the changes in, or cash requirements for, Center Parcs’ working capital needs;

         - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments on Center Parcs’ debt;

         - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that Center Parcs may be required to pay;

         - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in Center Parcs’
consolidated income statement;

         - in the case of Adjusted EBITDA (but not EBITDA), it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges
resulting from certain matters Center Parcs consider not to be indicative of its underlying operations;

        - assets are depreciated or amortised over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in
the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

        - other companies in Center Parcs’ industry may calculate these measures differently from the manner
Center Parcs does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

In this Offering Memorandum, except where otherwise indicated, Adjusted EBITDA is presented before
exceptional and other non-underlying items. Exceptional and non-underlying items of £2.2 million for the financial year
ended 23 April 2020 represented £2.0 million in costs to exit a contract and £0.2 million of legal and other associated
costs relating to the equity contribution provided by funds managed by Brookfield. Exceptional and non-underlying items
for the financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented £1.6 million of costs relating to legal health and safety claims at
Woburn Forest and associated settlements, together with £0.7 million of one-off restructuring and reorganisation costs.

For a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to profit for the period attributable to equity
shareholders, see “Summary Historical Financial and Operating Information”.

In addition, this Offering Memorandum includes the following key performance indicators that Center Parcs’
Directors use to set targets and measure performance against those targets.

_Occupancy_

Occupancy is the average number of units of accommodation occupied as a percentage of the total number
available. Units of accommodation are deemed to be occupied when utilised during the relevant period under review.
When units of accommodation are out of service for refurbishment, they are still included in the occupancy calculations.
Center Parcs is focused on driving occupancy levels to optimise the number of guests, which in turn increases
accommodation revenue and optimises on-site expenditure.

_Average Daily Rate (“ADR”)_

ADR is the average rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total accommodation income for the period
divided by the total number of accommodation nights sold. Center Parcs uses ADR to help measure and maximise its
yield.

xv


-----

_Rent Per Available Lodge night (“RevPAL”)_

RevPAL is the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on the total accommodation income
divided by the total available number of accommodation nights. Center Parcs’ management believes RevPAL to be the
most meaningful key performance indicator because it takes into account both occupancy and ADR.

_Net on-site guest spend per lodge night_

Net on-site guest spend per lodge night is calculated as on-site spend at Center Parcs-operated units and the
rent received from concession partners (i.e. on-site revenue) for a period, divided by the sum of the number of guestoccupied lodges during each night of such period.

_Forward bookings as a percentage of available capacity_

Forward bookings as a percentage of available capacity means the number of accommodation nights sold
divided by total available accommodation nights for the period. This indicator provides management with forward
visibility of future occupancy levels.

_Cash conversion_

Cash conversion is defined as Adjusted EBITDA for a period less maintenance capital expenditure made in
such period plus working capital and non-cash movements (less difference between the pension charge and contribution)
in such period, expressed as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA. This indicator helps management measure the cash
generated by Center Parcs’ core operations.

Center Parcs defines maintenance capital expenditure as the capital expenditure required on the central
buildings, infrastructure and facilities to maintain the ongoing standards of these areas.

**OVERVIEW**

Center Parcs is a leading UK short-break holiday business, attracting over 2.1 million guests in the 52-week period
ended 27 February 2020. Center Parcs operates five specially constructed holiday villages in the United Kingdom:
Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Elveden Forest in Suffolk, Whinfell Forest in Cumbria
(the “Original Villages”) and Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire. Each village is set in a forest environment amongst
approximately 400 acres of forest around a lake and is open 365 days per year.

Woodland, water and a natural environment make up the essential environment of a Center Parcs break. Within
this comfortable, quiet, car-free and family-friendly setting, each of the Center Parcs villages provides guests with high
quality accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. In total, as of 28 August 2020, there were 4,335 units
of accommodation across its five villages, which could accommodate approximately 22,958 guests per day at 100%
occupancy. The focal point and key attraction of each village is an all-weather indoor sub-tropical swimming paradise,
featuring a selection of water activities including a wave pool, river slides and rides, children’s pools and Jacuzzis. Center
Parcs’ on-site experiences also include outdoor activities such as cycling, boating and zip wires; indoor activities such as
ten-pin bowling, badminton and pottery; and amenities such as spas, food and beverage and retail. A significant proportion
of Center Parcs’ revenue is generated from guests’ on-site spending, including for leisure and spa activities, food and
beverage and retail, representing 39.2% of total revenue in financial year 2020.

Center Parcs has a well-established brand in the UK, renowned for providing high quality experiences and
facilities, targeting a primary guest base of affluent families. Center Parcs benefits from strong guest loyalty with
approximately 34% of guests returning within 14 months and approximately 54% returning over a five-year period. In
addition, Center Parcs believes that its business model is difficult to replicate due to the lack of suitable locations for the
development of holiday parks and high development costs while Center Parcs is well positioned to continue to grow its
business.

Center Parcs’ villages typically draw on a regional population of guests who are attracted to the convenience of
being within a relatively short driving distance from home. Over 90% of the UK population lives within a 2.5 hour drive
of at least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two hour drive of the village
they choose to visit. Center Parcs believes that the proximity of the majority of guests to its villages combined with the
easy accessibility of the villages by car make Center Parcs a popular and convenient short break holiday option. Occupancy
levels at Center Parcs’ villages have been consistently high: 97.6% in financial year 2018, 97.1% in financial year 2019,
and 97.3% in the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. Occupancy levels have averaged approximately 96% in the last
15 years to 27 February 2020, and approximately 97% in the last eight years to 27 February 2020, despite the expansion
of existing accommodation offerings at Center Parcs’ Original Villages and the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014.

For the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, Center Parcs had revenue of £496.3 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of £239.4 million, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.2%.

**STRENGTHS**

**_Unique, market-leading short break holiday business._**

Center Parcs believes that it provides a unique product in the UK holiday market in terms of scale, quality and
standard of accommodation and amenities. Each Center Parcs village is set in approximately 400 acres of forest around a
lake, with numerous retail and food and beverage offerings, as well as more than 150 leisure and spa related activities and
an indoor sub-tropical swimming paradise. Each village has on average 866 units of accommodation with capacity for
approximately 4,580 guests. Center Parcs believes that it is the only large-scale UK business offering this type of high
quality family-focused, year-round, all-weather, short-break package, in a forest environment. Center Parcs believes that it
is well-positioned to benefit from pent-up demand for domestic travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with its
villages typically drawing on a regional population of guests who live within a relatively short driving distance. Further,
the design of Center Parcs’ villages lends itself well to social distancing, as most guests travel to the villages in their own

1


-----

cars, the lodges provide for self-catering, the villages are spread out over a large open footprint and many of the activities
are outdoors.

**_Difficult to replicate concept with well-known brand and loyal, affluent customer base._**

The Center Parcs villages are characterised by a number of qualities that Center Parcs believes make its business
model difficult to replicate in the United Kingdom. These include:

    - limited appropriate sites for villages, which require large forested areas near major population centres;

    - long lead time needed to develop new villages due to the stringent requirements for obtaining planning
permits;

    - significant initial investment cost in addition to on-going capital expenditure required for further
development and operations of the business; and

    - a wide range of specialised operations and planning expertise required to develop and operate a village.

Center Parcs’ unique product offering has generated strong brand recognition and guest loyalty. Center Parcs
believes that it has high brand recognition in the UK and is considered among the top brands for high quality short breaks
in the UK.

Center Parcs’ “intention to return” score was 95% in financial year 2020. Approximately 34% of Center Parcs’
guests return within 14 months and approximately 54% return over a five-year period. Center Parcs’ active marketable
guest base was approximately 309,000 households in 2020.

In 2019, three of Center Parcs’ Aqua Sana spas were shortlisted for Good Spa Awards, and Aqua Sana Sherwood
Forest was awarded Best Destination Spa in the UK. Aqua Sana Sherwood Forest had previously been awarded Best Spa
in the East Midlands and the East in November 2018.

Center Parcs’ guest profile has remained stable over time and consists of the highest earning categories of the UK
population. According to management estimates, Center Parcs ranked significantly over index in a number of the Experian
high end consumer classifications, with 57% of guests in financial year 2019 identified under the Experian Mosaic
classification as “Domestic Success”, “Prestige Positions” or “Aspiring Homemakers” based on postcode analysis.

**_Resilient growth through economic cycles._**

Resilient performance through economic cycles, during both downturns and recoveries, and also through additions
in capacity, has resulted in Center Parcs’ occupancy levels averaging over 90% over the last 20 years to 27 February 2020,
approximately 96% in the last 15 years to 27 February 2020 and approximately 97% in the last eight years to
27 February 2020, with occupancy levels of 97.6%, 97.1% and 97.3% in financial years 2018 and 2019 and the 52-week
period ended 27 February 2020, respectively. Occupancy at each of the villages has historically remained high even after
the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014 despite an approximately 20% increase in Center Parcs’ accommodation available,
demonstrating the depth of demand for Center Parcs’ villages. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic
conditions as well as on guests’ willingness to travel, and the restrictions on Center Parcs’ ability to operate at full capacity
following the re-opening of the villages on 13 July 2020, demand for Center Parcs’ villages remains resilient and is already
exceeding expected operating capacity for some breaks. As at 21 August 2020, forward bookings for the third quarter and
fourth quarter of financial year 2021 (including bookings that have been moved with a financial incentive from the COVID19 closure period) were approximately 1% and 9% higher, respectively, than forward bookings at the same point during
financial year 2020, despite a significant reduction in marketing expenditure during the closure of Center Parcs’ villages
from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The following graph shows Center Parcs’ occupancy rates and average units of accommodation for financial years
2008 to 2019 and the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020.

High occupancy levels drive a significant proportion of revenue from guests’ on-site spending, which represented
39.2% of Center Parcs’ total revenue in financial year 2020.

ADR on average also consistently grew above inflation between financial year 2008 and the 52-week period ended
27 February 2020, at a CAGR of 3.6%. During this period, Center Parcs’ RevPAL growth was approximately twice the
growth in inflation and UK RevPAR during the period. The growth in Center Parcs’ ADR has been driven by yield
management initiatives, demand and on-site investment, including in new types of accommodation and upgrades to existing
accommodation.

The following table shows RevPAL and ADR for Center Parcs as compared to UK RevPAR and the CPI for
financial years 2008 to 2019 and the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020.

**_Consistent revenue growth with strong visibility through forward-booking model._**

With the exception of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in financial year 2020, Center Parcs has experienced
revenue growth each year over the last ten years, with revenue growing at a CAGR of 5.5% from financial year 2008 to
the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. In addition, Center Parcs’ Adjusted EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of 6.6%
from financial year 2008 to the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. Center Parcs places a strong emphasis on advance
prepaid bookings, which result in significant revenue visibility, with an average of 19 weeks’ booking-to-arrival time in

3


-----

financial years 2018 to 2020. For each of financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, an average of approximately 43% of the
available accommodation nights had been booked by the beginning of the financial year, an average of 59% by the end of
the first quarter, an average of 76% halfway through the financial year, and an average of 95% two months before the end
of the financial year.

Under its standard terms and conditions, Center Parcs collects 30% of the accommodation cost at the time of
booking if completed more than ten weeks in advance of the short break. The balance of the cost is collected ten weeks
prior to the start of the break. If a guest books less than ten weeks prior to the arrival date, the accommodation cost is
payable in full on booking. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some changes have been made to these conditions, but
a reversion to standard terms and conditions is expected. Similarly, in the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, more
than 64% of leisure and spa activities were pre-booked and pre-paid prior to arrival. This significant revenue visibility
allows Center Parcs to optimise its cost structure according to anticipated occupancy levels and demand throughout the
year. As a result of its flexible cost base, Center Parcs reduced operating expenses by approximately £14 million on average
per four-week period, or approximately 70%, to approximately £6 million on average per four-week period from
24 April 2020 to 18 June 2020, compared to approximately £20 million on average per four-week period from
26 April 2019 to 27 February 2020, by ceasing activity on approximately 90% of active capital investment projects,
furloughing approximately 90% of employees in accordance with the UK government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme
(“CJRS”) from 27 March 2020 to 3 July 2020 and utilitising the 12-month business rates holiday available to retail,
hospitality and leisure businesses.

**_Sustainable cash flow generation._**

With the exception of the periods impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs’ EBITDA margins have
been underpinned by high occupancy levels and consistent growth in ADR. Relatively high EBITDA margins combined
with the negative working capital characteristics of the business due to its forward-booking model and the relatively low
maintenance capital expenditure requirements, which averaged £21.1 million per financial year from financial year 2008
to financial year 2020, has enabled Center Parcs to be highly cash generative, with cash conversion (defined as Adjusted
EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure plus working capital and non-cash movements (less difference between the
pension charge and contribution), expressed as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA) in excess of 85% in each of financial
years 2018 and 2019 and the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, at 94.1%, 91.2%, and 87.4%, respectively. Center
Parcs addressed the impact of the closure of its villages due to the COVID-19 pandemic by aiming to minimise the
proportion of guests seeking refunds by offering a £100 financial incentive to guests to move dates. Approximately 35%
of guests opted to change their booking dates instead of cancelling altogether. In addition, Center Parcs was also able to
further manage cash flow by ceasing activity on approximately 90% of active capital investment projects during the closure.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Brookfield reiterated its commitment to Center Parcs through equity contributions from
the Brookfield Funds of £69 million, comprising £41.5 million received in April 2020 and £27.5 million received in May
2020, and the Intercompany Account Advance of £70 million received on 14 July 2020. These commitments are part of a
total of £160 million of financial support available to Center Parcs that has been approved by the Brookfield Funds.

**_Well-invested, diversified and high-quality asset base._**

Center Parcs owns all five of its UK villages on either freehold titles or long leasehold titles, and with remaining
lease terms of between 53 years and 980 years, Center Parcs’ asset base has a long life and is diversified and stable. In
financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have been broadly evenly split amongst
its villages, located in different parts of the UK, reflecting both the individual strength of each village and the diversity of
Center Parcs’ asset base.

Center Parcs has an on-going capital expenditure programme to maintain and enhance the quality of its asset base,
pursuant to which it has invested approximately £724 million from financial year 2008 through financial year 2020. Of this
investment, £279 million represents maintenance capital expenditures. The remainder represents investment capital
expenditure, of which £212 million was invested to upgrade existing accommodation, £100 million was invested to build
new developments, £116 million was invested in on-site development, including new leisure activities, food and beverage
offerings and facilities upgrades and £17 million was invested in its Digital Roadmap project. In addition, Center Parcs
incurred approximately £250 million of total initial development costs in respect of building Woburn Forest.

Since the acquisition of Center Parcs by the Brookfield Funds in August 2015, the amount of total capital
expenditure has increased from £43 million (of which investment capital expenditure: £19 million) in financial year 2015
to £84.5 million (of which investment capital expenditure: £59 million), £66.1 million (of which investment capital
expenditure: £39 million) and £52.8 million (of which investment capital expenditure: £25 million) in financial years 2018,
2019 and 2020, respectively, reflecting the Brookfield Fund’s commitment to the business and focus on a range of capital
investment opportunities to further grow the business. In financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, the construction of new
build accommodation comprised approximately £25 million, £10 million and £6 million, respectively, of investment

4


-----

capital expenditure, while a range of ongoing village refurbishments of accommodation, restaurants, retail outlets, spas and
other offerings and facilities comprised the remainder.

**_Experienced management team with a track record of innovation._**

Center Parcs has an experienced management team with a proven ability to execute its business plans and achieve
results. In addition, Center Parcs’ management team has a track record of innovation reflected in its yield management
initiatives, innovation in on-site activities and food and beverage offerings, as well as development of new types of
accommodation to help drive ADR. In 2014, the management team successfully opened Woburn Forest on time and on
budget. With an average length of service of over 15 years by individual members of its management team, the management
team is highly experienced in providing the services that set Center Parcs apart from other UK leisure and holiday providers.
Center Parcs also benefits from the operational expertise, relationships, and management experience of Brookfield.

**STRATEGIES**

**_Continue to grow revenue through yield management, flexible pricing, targeted marketing and customer relationship_**
**_management._**

Center Parcs actively manages pricing across its villages to maintain its high level of occupancy and to optimise
yield during periods of high demand. All bookings are made directly with Center Parcs, with approximately 87% of
accommodation bookings made online in financial year 2020. Together with its strong emphasis on advance bookings
(average 19 weeks’ booking-to-arrival time period in financial years 2018 to 2020), this provides Center Parcs with
significant operational information, allowing it to respond quickly to customer trends in order to optimise its pricing. Center
Parcs will continue to operate a flexible pricing model to further grow revenue, and to develop its customer relationship
management initiatives to increase demand from the affluent families that form its core guest base. Following the reopening
of the villages on 13 July 2020, Center Parcs’ villages initially operated at approximately 65% capacity, which was
increased to 75% capacity on 7 September 2020. Capacity levels will be reviewed in due course pursuant to government
guidelines and health and safety considerations.

Center Parcs’ guest database of approximately 309,000 active guests allows it to undertake targeted marketing
campaigns using a range of channels, including direct mailings, online and digital marketing, television campaigns and
email programmes focused on both existing customers and targeted acquisition of new affluent families.

**_Continue to invest in revenue-enhancing upgrades of Center Parcs accommodation offering and to expand available_**
**_capacity._**

Center Parcs plans to continue to invest in upgrading the accommodation and facilities in its villages, and to
introduce new accommodation and on-site activities. Since 2007, Center Parcs has opened over 230 new units of
accommodation at its Original Villages, and significantly upgraded all units of accommodation at the Original Villages at
an average estimated cost of approximately £50,000 per lodge. Following the upgrade of all existing units of
accommodation, Center Parcs has started a new cycle of refurbishment for such accommodation which is important to
maintain quality and generate repeat business and 1,943 units of accommodation have been upgraded as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum.

There is also capacity for additional new builds of premium lodges at Center Parcs’ villages, which typically
achieve a premium over the rate achieved on standard lodges. Center Parcs believes that such premium lodges attract
affluent guests who are more likely to be high on-site spenders. Center Parcs currently has planning permission to build a
further 103 units of accommodation. The new units of accommodation are expected to include waterside lodges, apartments
and other executive lodges.

**_Disciplined investment in village experience._**

Center Parcs believes that there are several substantial development projects that could profitably expand Center
Parcs’ offering, including Project Atlantis, which involves the strategic enhancement of the signature sub-tropical
swimming paradise that features at each village. Center Parcs spent approximately £38 million between 2012 and 2020 on
implementing Project Atlantis. Improvements included the addition of a new raft ride, the Tropical Cyclone, and a new
play area featuring numerous slides and water feature at Elveden Forest, Longleat Forest and Sherwood Forest. Over the
next two years, Center Parcs plans to make similar upgrades to the pool facilities at Whinfell Forest. Center Parcs has also
invested approximately £6.5 million in the refurbishment and expansion of the Aqua Sana spa facility at Longleat Forest.

Center Parcs also intends to introduce new leisure activities at each village on a regular basis, as well as innovate
upon its existing offering of leisure activities. Development opportunities include introducing zip wires, electric boats and
expanding indoor climbing activities to all villages. Center Parcs believes that such investments provide an enriched

5


-----

holiday experience particularly for the affluent families that form its core guest base, and that an improved on-site unique
offering helps to drive both accommodation and on-site revenue.

**_Grow on-site spend._**

Center Parcs generated 40.3%, 39.5% and 39.2% of its total revenue from on-site spend in the financial years
2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. As Center Parcs’ guests typically remain on-site for the duration of their stay, Center
Parcs believes that there are opportunities to grow on-site spend further. For example, Center Parcs has continued to
develop a programme of enhanced differentiation in pricing where prices of various offerings are expected to become
flexible across seasons, days of the week and times of day to more accurately reflect guest demand.

Center Parcs has franchise, licensing and concession agreements with various providers. These concession
partners enable guests to benefit from high street brand offerings and Center Parcs to increase profitability through
increased on-site spend. Center Parcs reviews these agreements periodically to ensure that they remain economically
attractive and meet its guests’ requirements.

**_Continue to increase profitability through controlling costs._**

Center Parcs benefits from having a flexible cost base. Because of the high level of forward booking visibility of
the business, Center Parcs is typically able to manage its cost base effectively to meet its business requirements. As part of
the strategy to seek profitable growth, it intends to continue to generate cost savings through increased efficiency at each
village and at its head office.

Following the reopening of Center Parcs’ villages on 13 July 2020, Center Parcs expects to continue to focus on
cost efficiency and optimisation while complying with new regulations and ensuring the safety of its guests and employees.
Center Parcs expects its operating costs to be higher in the short-term due to the implementation of additional health and
safety procedures pursuant to government guidelines related to COVID-19.

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**

**Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic**

The disruptions to Center Parcs’ operations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”) have had,
and continue to have, a material negative impact on Center Parcs’ financial condition and results of operations. The
outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in an unprecedented global response to contain the spread of the disease. The UK
government, advised by medical and scientific advisers, continually updates the guidance it is issuing to deal with a
rapidly evolving landscape. COVID-19 presents specific challenges to businesses in the leisure, hospitality and retail
sectors, with the introduction of travel and other restrictions.

On 16 March 2020 the UK Government announced wide ranging measures to limit all non-essential social
contact; it advised against non-essential travel, and it asked the public to avoid hotels, restaurants, theatres and social
venues and set out a range of other measures and guidance. Following the guidance and advice issued by the UK
Government, Center Parcs took the decision to close its five holiday villages in the United Kingdom with effect from 20
March 2020 and the holiday villages remained closed until 13 July 2020.

Since reopening on 13 July 2020, Center Parcs has implemented significant operational changes in
accordance with government health and safety regulations. Center Parcs’ villages reopened at approximately 65%
capacity, which was increased to 75% capacity on 7 September 2020. Capacity levels will be reviewed in due course
pursuant to government guidelines and health and safety considerations. Center Parcs has implemented an enhanced
cleaning regime throughout the villages, including hand sanitisation stations, deep cleaning of accommodation between
departing and arriving guests and increased cleaning and disinfection of public areas. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, a small number of Center Parcs’ leisure activities remain unavailable to guests. Center Parcs continues to
review and amend its operating procedures, prioritising guest and employee safety.

Whilst the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic are not clear, Center Parcs has been taking and
continues to take decisive and reasonable steps to manage its business and cost base to maintain cashflow. Management
has undertaken a number of actions available to it to preserve cash and maintain liquidity, including having:

      - ceased non-essential operating expenditure;

      - reviewed and rephased approximately 90% of non-essential capital investment projects;

      - negotiated a 12-month business rates holiday;

6


-----

      - negotiated a three-month month holiday on PAYE and NI Payments, which equates to approximately

£6 million, and a deferral of VAT payments until March 2021, which equates to approximately £6
million; and

      - furloughed approximately 90% of the Group’s employees and reduced the salaries of directors by 25%

during the period of closure of the holiday villages.

Together, these actions reduced operating expenses by approximately £14 million on average per four-week
period, or approximately 70%, to approximately £6 million on average per four-week period from 24 April 2020 to
18 June 2020, compared to approximately £20 million on average per four-week period from 26 April 2019 to
27 February 2020.

Brookfield has, throughout this period, demonstrated its ongoing support and commitment to Center Parcs’
business. Brookfield (through its fund, BSREP II Center Parcs Jersey Limited) provided the Center Parcs Group, which
is one of the largest investments in the BSREP II fund, with £41.5 million in April 2020 and a further £27.5 million in
May 2020 in equity contributions.

On 14 July 2020, the Brookfield Funds provided an advance of £70 million (the “Intercompany Account
**Advance”) to CP Opco under an intercompany account agreement (the “Intercompany Account Agreement”) to**
continue to support Center Parcs during the COVID-19 pandemic. These commitments are part of a total of £160 million
of financial support available to Center Parcs that has been approved by the Brookfield Funds.

In spite of these actions, the closure of Center Parcs’ villages unsurprisingly had a negative effect on Center
Parcs’ earnings. Center Parcs did not record any revenue from holidays that would have taken place during the closure
period from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020. In addition, Center Parcs offered guests who had booked holidays for the
closure period the option of a refund for their holiday or postponing their break to later dates, with a £100 financial
incentive offered to guests choosing to postpone. A majority of guests sought refunds for their break, which resulted in
an adverse impact to Center Parcs’ liquidity and cash flow. Center Parcs also has utilised UK government support
initiatives including the business rates’ holiday and the UK government’s CJRS. Center Parcs has reduced prices in
response to the temporarily reduced VAT rate of 5% applicable to leisure businesses. Nevertheless, management believes
that the underlying liquidity position of Center Parcs remains healthy. As at 20 August 2020, cash on balance sheet was
£119.2 million (£102.2 million as at 16 July 2020). In addition, Center Parcs has access to a £90 million undrawn
committed liquidity facility, which is available to pay certain expenses in connection with its senior obligations and the
Class A Note interest.

Although Fitch affirmed the Issuer’s credit rating on 18 June 2020 and S&P affirmed the BBB credit rating of
the Issuer’s Class A Notes on 16 July 2020, the credit rating of the Issuer’s Class B Notes was downgraded to B- on
16 July 2020 by S&P. The downgrade may impact the Issuer’s (and therefore Center Parcs’) access to capital and the
cost of any debt financings.

**The Consent Solicitations**

On 17 July 2020, the Issuer launched consent solicitations in respect of the Class A Notes (the “Class A
**Consent Solicitation”) and the existing Class B Notes (the “Class B Consent Solicitation”) in connection with its**
financial covenants under these notes, seeking further headroom and protection in the event of an economic downturn or
further prolonged closures of, and operational restrictions on, the holiday villages.

With respect to the Class A Notes, the Issuer sought, and on 10 August 2020 obtained, the requisite approval
from the Class A Noteholders to waive the requirement to comply with the Class A FCF DSCR covenant in respect of
the Financial Covenant Test Dates falling in August 2020, February 2021 and August 2021. It also sought, and on
10 August 2020 obtained, the requisite approval of the Class A Noteholders to adjust the basis on which this covenant is
calculated for the purposes of the Financial Covenant Test Date falling in February 2022, to ensure that such calculation
is not adversely affected by any enforced closure of or operational restrictions in respect of the holiday villages during
the FCF DSCR Period in respect of the Financial Covenant Test Date falling in February 2022.

For the period in which the waiver in respect of the Class A FCF DSCR covenant is in place, the Obligor Group
cannot make any Class A Restricted Payment (see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan
_Agreement—Class A Restricted Payment” for more information) or use any cash generated by the Obligor Group to make_
any payments in respect of the Class B Loans or purchase any Class B Notes. For the period in which the waiver of the
Class A FCF DSCR covenant is in place, the Obligor Group has sought, by way of extraordinary resolution of the Class
A Noteholders, to amend the Class A IBLA so as to permit it to make payments in respect of the Class B Loans and/or
Class B Notes out of the proceeds of new Class B Loans where the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is not satisfied
(subject to a cap of £75 million for the purposes of payments of interest in respect of the Class B Loans). Therefore, any
net proceeds from this Offering remaining after redemption and repayment of the Class B3 Notes may be used to make

7


-----

payments in respect of the Class B Loan or the Class B Notes without the requirement to comply with the Class A
Restricted Payment Condition.

With respect to the existing Class B Notes, the Issuer sought, and on 29 July 2020 obtained, the requisite
approval from the Class B Noteholders to suspend the requirement to comply with the Class B FCF DSCR covenant in
respect of the Financial Covenant Test Dates falling in August 2020, February 2021 and August 2021 and to adjust the
basis on which this covenant is calculated for the purposes of the Financial Covenant Test Date falling in February 2022,
to ensure that such calculation is not adversely affected by any further enforced closure of or operational restrictions on
the holiday villages during the FCF DSCR Period in respect of the Financial Covenant Test Date falling in February
2022.

**Paragraph on Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern in Audit Report**

The audit report in relation to the 2020 Audited Financial Statements contains a material uncertainty paragraph
in relation to going concern. As described in Note 1 to the 2020 Audited Financial Statements, as a result of the adverse
impacts of COVID-19 on both Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited directly and the wider travel, hospitality and leisure
industry, there is uncertainty in relation to forecasting the nature and extent of government and social distancing
restrictions that would impact the villages, the impact of consumer sentiment and hence the length of time it will take to
achieve a full recovery, uncertainty in relation to the ability of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited to secure additional
funding which may be required in certain scenarios and uncertainty over the ability of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited
to obtain waivers for any forecast potential breach of financial covenants. These events or conditions, along with the
other matters as set forth in Note 1 to the 2020 Audited Financial Statements, indicate that a material uncertainty exists
that may cast significant doubt on Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and its subsidiaries’ ability to continue as a going
concern on F-22.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Center Parcs’ Business and Industry — _The COVID-19 pandemic has_
_negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of_
_operations.”_

**Current trading for the twelve-week period ended 16 July 2020**

As discussed above under “—The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic”, the Group’s villages successfully reopened on 13 July 2020, with reduced accommodation capacity and guest activities, after having been closed on
13 March 2020. Therefore, the twelve-week period ended 16 July 2020 only includes revenue of £1.2 million relating to
one break, from 13 July 2020 to 16 July 2020. Cost of sales of £3.8 million were recognised in the twelve-week period
ended 16 July 2020 and primarily related to staff costs. This compares to cost of sales of £30.9 million in the comparative
period in the prior year. The decrease in cost of sales is directly related to the fall in revenue. Administrative expenses of
£17.1 million were incurred during the period, as compared to administrative expenses of £27.8 million in the
comparative period in the prior year. The decrease in administrative expenses primarily related to the elimination of nonessential expenditure during the period of village closure, as well as the benefit of the UK government’s CJRS and 12month business rates holiday. The Group had an unaudited loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of
£19.7 million in the twelve-week period ended 16 July 2020.

During the twelve-week period ended 16 July 2020, the Group spent £5.9 million on capital expenditures,
comprising £4.0 million on maintenance capital expenditure, as compared to £5.3 million in the corresponding period in
the prior year, and £1.9 million on investment capital expenditure, as compared to £5.3 million in the corresponding
period in the prior year.

As at 21 August 2020, forward bookings for the third quarter and fourth quarter of financial year 2021
(including bookings that have been moved with a financial incentive from the COVID-19 closure period) were
approximately 1% and 9% higher, respectively, than forward bookings at the same point during financial year 2020.

including the prepayment premium. See “Use of Proceeds.”

On or about the Sixth Closing Date, the Issuer will redeem £230,000,000 of the aggregate principal amount of
the Class B3 Notes at a redemption price of 101.063% of the principal amount of such Class B3 Notes redeemed, which
is the redemption price applicable to the Class B3 Notes on or after 28 August 2020 but prior to 28 August 2021.
Proceeds of the Class B5 Loan in the amount of £230,000,000 will be used to prepay a corresponding portion of the

as to enable a redemption by the Issuer of a corresponding portion of the Class B3 Notes. The payment of the prepayment
premium will be made from the remaining proceeds of the Class B5 Loan. The payment of the accrued and unpaid
interest up to the date of prepayment will be funded from other funds available to the Borrowers. The Issuer will apply
the proceeds of such prepayment to redeem, on a pro rata basis, a corresponding amount of the Class B3 Notes on or
about the Sixth Closing Date. The redemption of the Class B3 Notes is referred to in this Offering Memorandum as the
“Refinancing”.

The issuance of the Class B5 Notes, and the use of proceeds therefrom, including the Refinancing, are
collectively referred to in this Offering Memorandum as the “Transactions”.

**THE ISSUER**

CPUK Finance Limited, or the Issuer, is a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Jersey. The
Issuer has conducted no operations or other material activities other than in relation to the issuance of the Class A Notes,
the Original Class B Notes, the Class B2 Notes, the Class B3 Notes, the Class B4 Notes and the Class B5 Notes and

_Except as otherwise stated, the summary below has been prepared on the basis that the Transactions have_
_been consummated._

**Key Characteristics of the Class B5 Notes and Class B5 Loans**

**_Issuer:_** CPUK Finance Limited, a limited liability company incorporated under the

whose primary purpose is to issue the Notes and to lend the proceeds
thereof to the Borrowers. The Issuer has no subsidiaries.

**_Ranking:_** The Class B5 Notes will be constituted by the Fifth Supplemental Note

Notes, and will be contractually subordinated to the Class A Notes as to
payment and rank junior with respect to security, other than with respect to

Class B3 Facility and the Class B4 Loan under the Class B4 Facility
pursuant to the terms of a third amended and restated junior loan
agreement between, among others, the Issuer, the Borrowers, the
Guarantors and the Borrower Security Trustee (the “Third Amended and
**Restated** **Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement”).**

On the Sixth Closing Date, the Issuer will fund the Class B5 Loan under
the Class B5 Facility pursuant to the terms of a fourth amended and

will undertake, under the terms of the Topco Payment Undertaking, to
procure the payment of an amount equal to the aggregate of: (a) the then
principal balance of the Class B Loans; (b) accrued but unpaid interest

Note Final Maturity Date, being 28 August 2050.

**_Final maturity of the Class B5 Loan:_** The final maturity date in respect of the Class B5 Loan will be the later of

(a) the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date; and (b) the earliest of:
(i) the date on which all amounts outstanding under the Class A

13


-----

Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement have been irrevocably paid or discharged
in full; (ii) the date on which the Class A Loans are accelerated; and
(iii) the Loan Interest Payment Date falling in August 2050 (the “Class B5
**Loan Final Maturity Date”).**

**_Interest on the Class B5 Notes:_** For the Class B5 Notes,    % per annum from (and including) the Sixth
Closing Date up to (but excluding) the Note Interest Payment Date falling
in August 2026 (the “Class B5 Note Step-Down Date”) and, thereafter,

% per annum (each, as applicable, a “Class B5 Note Interest Rate”).

If on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the Issuer receives a payment of
interest (whether in whole or in part) on a Class B5 Loan, from the
Borrowers in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement, then the Issuer will be obliged to make a corresponding
payment of interest (in whole or in part, as the case may be) on the Class
B5 Notes on the corresponding Note Interest Payment Date. If on any Note
Interest Payment Date, the amount received by the Issuer in respect of a
payment of interest on the Class B5 Loan is not sufficient to pay the
interest accrued on the Class B5 Notes, during the immediately preceding
Note Interest Period in full, the amount of interest accrued up to any such
Note Interest Payment Date that is not paid by the Issuer on such Note
Interest Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred
interest, being a “Deferred Interest **Amount”) and such Deferred Interest**
Amount shall continue to accrue interest at the then applicable Class B5
Note Interest Rate, as relevant, until it is paid by the Issuer in full.

If on any Loan Interest Payment Date:

(i) the Issuer receives a payment of interest on the Class B5

Loan from the Borrower in accordance with the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in excess of the
amount of interest accrued on the Class B5 Notes during
the immediately preceding Note Interest Period; and

(ii) on such Note Interest Payment Date, a Deferred Interest

Amount in respect of any prior Note Interest Period
remains outstanding,

then the Issuer shall apply such excess to reduce the then outstanding
Deferred Interest Amount. Interest and the aggregate amount of all
Deferred Interest Amounts then unpaid on the Class B5 Notes and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable by the Issuer
in pounds sterling on the Class B5 Note Final Maturity Date.

**_Interest on the Class B5 Loan:_** % per annum from (and including) the Sixth Closing Date up to (but
excluding) the Loan Interest Payment Date falling in August 2026 (the
“Class B5 Loan Step-Down Date”) and, thereafter,    % per annum
(each, as applicable, a “Class B5 Interest Rate”).

From (and including) the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date, interest
will accrue on the Class B5 Loan at the applicable Class B5 Interest Rate
until (but excluding) the Class B Loan Final Maturity Date) but such
accruing interest will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest
being a “Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest Amount”) and such Class B5
Loan Deferred Interest Amount will accrue interest at the applicable Class
B5 Interest Rate until paid by the Borrowers in full. On each Loan Interest
Payment Date, interest accrued on the Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest
Amount during the immediately preceding Loan Interest Period will be
added to the then outstanding Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and
thereafter paid at the times and in the same manner as the Class B5 Loan
Deferred Interest Amount. The Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest Amount
and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon will be payable by the
Borrowers only on the earlier of (x) the date on which the Class A Loans

14


-----

are repaid in full (the “Initial Payment Date”) and (y) the Class B5 Note
Final Maturity Date; provided that if on the Initial Payment Date, the
Borrowers do not have sufficient cash to pay the Class B5 Loan Deferred
Interest Amount and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon in full on such
date in accordance with the Borrower Priorities of Payments, any unpaid
Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but unpaid
interest thereon will not fall due then but will continue to be deferred and
will only fall due for payment on any subsequent Loan Interest Payment
Date to the extent of the cash available to the Borrowers for such purpose
determined in accordance with the Borrower Priorities of Payments.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Class B5 Loan, any accrued but unpaid
interest thereon, any Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest Amounts and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon may be repaid prior to the Class B5
Note Final Maturity Date if (i) the Borrowers receive New Equity Funds
(as defined in “Description of the Class B5 Loan”), (ii) the Topco Security
is enforced and proceeds thereof are available for this purpose and/or
(iii) the Transaction Security is enforced and funds are available for this
purpose pursuant to the applicable Priorities of Payments as described
under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor
_Agreement”, and the Issuer will be required to make the corresponding_
payments of interest on the Class B5 Notes using the proceeds of such
payments made by (directly or indirectly, or on behalf of) the Borrowers.

**_Cash Lock-Up:_** If at any time the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is not satisfied
(including if the Class A FCF DSCR falls below 135%) or, assuming that
the extraordinary resolution of the Class A Noteholders is approved under
the Class A Consent Solicitation, a Waiver End Date Certificate has not
been provided to the Borrower Security Trustee) then no payments
(including payments of interest) may be made in respect of the Class B
Loans and, consequently, the Class B Notes, unless funded out of new
equity or, (assuming that the extraordinary resolution of the Class A
Noteholders is approved under the Class A Consent Solicitation) on or
prior to the Financial Covenant Test Date occurring in February 2022 (for
so long as a Waiver End Date Certificate has not been delivered), the
proceeds of a Class B Loan provided that the aggregate amount of the
proceeds of any Class B Loan that is applied to pay interest in respect of
the Class B Loans may not exceed £75 million. See “Description of other
_Indebtedness — Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement”_

**_Class B5 Note Interest Payment Dates:_** Semi-annually in each year on 28 February and 28 August, subject to

adjustment for non-Business Days (starting 28 February 2021) (the “Note
**Interest Payment Dates” and each, a “Note Interest Payment Date”).**

**_Class B5 Loan Interest Payment Dates:_** Each day falling three Business Days prior to a Note Interest Payment Date

(the “Loan Interest Payment Dates” and each a “Loan Interest Payment
**Date”).**

**_Security for the Class B5 Notes:_** The Class B5 Notes will be secured on a subordinated basis by firstranking security in respect of substantially all of the Issuer’s property and
assets, which also secures the Class A Notes, including the Issuer’s rights
against each Obligor under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,
the Borrower Deed of Charge (including the security trusts created
thereunder), the Woburn Deed of Charge (including the security trusts
created thereunder), the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Cash
Management Agreement, the Issuer English Corporate Services
Agreement, the Issuer Jersey Corporate Services Agreement, the Issuer
Account Bank Agreement and the Agency Agreement and its rights in

application of enforcement proceeds, other than in respect of the Topco
Security.

_Financing Arrangements — Borrower Security Documents — Borrower_
_Deed of Charge” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —_
_Borrower Security Documents — Woburn Deed of Charge”._

**_Security:_** the Fourth Closing Date between the Issuer, Topco, CP Opco and the

Borrower Security Trustee, Topco undertakes to procure the payment of an
amount equal to the aggregate of (a) the then principal balance of the Class
B Loans; (b) accrued and unpaid interest outstanding in respect of the
Class B Loans; and (c) all other amounts outstanding under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (the “Topco Payment Undertaking”) in
the specified circumstances described therein. The Borrowers are obliged
to use such amount to prepay a corresponding amount of the Class B Loans

**_Class B5 Notes:_**


The Class B5 Notes will be pass-through notes and will be subject to
mandatory redemption prior to the Class B5 Note Final Maturity Date if
and to the extent that the Borrowers make principal repayments or
prepayments to the Issuer in respect of the Class B5 Loan, either at the
option of the Borrowers or following any enforcement of the Topco Share
Security or the Transaction Security.

Any such redemption of the Class B5 Notes will be on the same terms and
at the same prices (including any applicable premium) as for the
prepayment of the Class B5 Loan.

It is expected that, because of the terms of the Topco Payment Undertaking
and the Topco Security Documents, the Borrowers will elect to prepay the
Class B5 Loan on or before the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date,
but they are not obliged to do so and the Issuer is therefore not obliged to
redeem the Class B5 Notes on the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date.

At any time on or after 28 August 2022, the Class B5 Loans will be
prepayable at the option of the Borrowers, in whole or in part, at the
purchase prices set out in “Description of the Class B5 Loan— Prepayment
_— Optional Prepayment”._

At any time prior to 28 August 2022, the Borrowers may prepay some or
all of the Class B5 Loans at a prepayment price equal to 100% of their
principal amount outstanding plus (i) accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, and (ii) a make-whole premium as specified in
the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

Prior to 28 August 2022, the Borrowers may prepay up to 10% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the Class B5 Loan in each calendar
year at a prepayment price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the
Class B5 Loan prepaid.

In addition, prior to 28 August 2022, the Borrowers may on one or more
occasions use the net proceeds of specified equity offerings to prepay up to
40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Class B5 Loan, at a purchase
price equal to    % of the aggregate principal amount of the Class B5
Loan, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts, if any, up
to the prepayment date, provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the Class B5 Loan in issue remains outstanding after
the prepayment.


The funds received by the Issuer from the prepayment of the Class B5
Loan will be used by the Issuer to redeem a corresponding principal
amount of outstanding Class B5 Notes in accordance with the Class B
Conditions. See “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes — Condition
_5 (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation)”._

**_Mandatory offers to Purchase for Class B_** The terms of the asset sales covenant in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan

**_Change of Control and Asset Sales:_** Agreement require the Borrowers to use certain of the proceeds of certain

asset sales to either invest in additional assets or repay certain other
indebtedness, and if they do not, to use such excess proceeds since such
asset sale to make an offer to repurchase the Class B Notes at a repurchase
price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amount, if any, any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
purchase.

Following a Class B Change of Control (as defined in the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) with respect to the Class B5 Notes, the
Borrowers will be required to offer to repurchase all or any part of the

17


-----

Class B5 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest
Amount, if any, any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. See “Description of the Class B5
_Loan”._
**_Tender Offers:_** In connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale
Offer for the Class B5 Notes, if not less than 90 per cent. in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Class B5 Notes are validly
tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and purchased pursuant to such offer
by a Borrower, the Borrowers may prepay the remaining principal amount
of the Class B5 Loan, in whole but not in part, at a price equal to the
purchase price offered to holders of the Class B5 Notes pursuant to such
offer (which may be less than par) and the Issuer will be required to apply
the proceeds received from such prepayment to redeem a corresponding
principal amount of Class B5 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, at a redemption price
corresponding to the prepayment price. See “Description of the Class B5
_Loan— Prepayment—Optional Prepayment”._

**_Early redemption for tax and other reasons:_** The Class B5 Notes and the Class B5 Loan may be redeemed or repaid at

the option of the Issuer, in whole but not in part, at any time following
certain changes in tax laws and/or other laws at a price equal to 100% of
their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest
amounts, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, and
additional amounts if any, provided certain conditions are satisfied,
including that the Issuer has sufficient funds to make such redemption or
repayment. See “Description of the Class B5 Loan— Taxes — Repayment
_for Tax Reasons” and “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes —_
_Condition 5 (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation)”._

**_Class B5 Loan Financial Covenant:_** Prior to the repayment or satisfaction and discharge in full of the Class B3

Loan and the Class B4 Loan, under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement, the Obligors are required to maintain a ratio (expressed as a
percentage) of free cash flow to total debt service charges (the “Class B
**FCF DSCR”) equal to at least 100% on each Financial Covenant Test**
Date.

The Obligors will have the benefit of certain cure rights in the event that
the Class B FCF DSCR is less than 100%. On 29 July 2020, the Obligors
obtained the requisite Class B Noteholder consent pursuant to the Class B
Consent Solicitation to suspend the requirement to comply with the Class B
FCF DSCR financial covenant on the financial covenant test dates falling
in August 2020, February 2021 and August 2021 and to adjust the basis on
which this covenant is calculated for the purposes of the financial covenant
test date falling in February 2022.

The Class B FCF DSCR financial covenant in the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement shall no longer be required to be complied with following
the repayment or satisfaction and discharge in full of the Class B3 Notes
and the Class B4 Notes. See “Description of the Class B5 Loan”.

For the purposes of any amendment, consent, waiver, modification,
variation or supplement in respect of the Class B FCF DSCR financial
covenant in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the relevant
Class B Noteholders shall be the Class B3 Noteholders and the Class B4
Noteholders. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —
_Instructing Group.”_

**_Certain other Class B5 Loan covenants:_** The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement limits, among other things,

Topco and the Obligors with respect to:

investments;

                                          - the incurrence of certain liens;

                                        - the imposition of restrictions on the ability of
subsidiaries to pay dividends and other payments to
members of the Group;

                                        - the transfer, lease, sale or other disposition of certain
assets;

                                          - the merger, consolidation with, or sale of substantially all
of the Group’s assets to, other entities;

                                          - the entry into certain transactions with affiliates; and

                                          - the impairment of the security interest for the holders of
Class B Notes.

Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and
qualifications. See “Description of the Class B5 Loan”.

**_Events of Default:_** No Class B Note Event of Default or Class B Loan Event of Default may
occur with respect to the Class B Notes or any Class B Loans while the
Class A Notes or Class A Loans are outstanding (until after an acceleration
of the Class A Notes or Class A Loans, respectively). However the Class B
Noteholders have the ability to demand repayment by Topco pursuant to
the Topco Payment Undertaking and direct the Borrower Security Trustee
to enforce the security granted pursuant to the Topco Security Documents
upon the occurrence of any Share Enforcement Event.

**_Share Enforcement Event:_** Each of the following will constitute a Share Enforcement Event under the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, among others:

                                        - any default in the payment of interest or additional
amounts, if any, on a Class B Loan (subject to a 30-day
grace period);

                                        - any amount remaining outstanding under a Class B Loan
at the close of business on the Class B Loan Expected
Maturity Date of such Class B Loan;

                                        - any failure to pay principal or premium on a Class B
Loan upon any optional redemption, required repurchase
or declaration;

                                          - any failure to comply with the covenant described under
the headings “Description of the Class B5 Loan—Class
_B Change of Control” (other than a failure to purchase_
Class B Notes which will constitute a Share Enforcement
Event per the above) (subject to 30 day grace period);

                                        - any failure to comply with the covenant described under
the heading “Description of the Class B5 Loan— Certain
_Covenants — Limitation on Holding Company_
_Activities”;_

                                          - any failure to comply with certain other covenants under
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (subject to a
60-day grace period);

19


-----

                                          - default under any indebtedness that results from a failure
to pay principal when due or results in acceleration of
such indebtedness (subject to a £25.0 million threshold);

                                        - certain bankruptcy events of default;

                                          - certain judgment defaults (subject to a £25.0 million
threshold and 60-day grace period);

                                          - any impairment of the security interest granted in respect
of material collateral (subject to a 10-business day grace
period); and

                                          - any impairment of a guarantee.

If a Share Enforcement Event occurs and is continuing, the Borrower
Security Trustee acting upon instructions of the Issuer Security Trustee as
directed by the Class B Note Trustee, who shall be required to act if
directed by the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Class B Notes, will be able to enforce the Topco Security,
subject to certain requirements being met. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements —Intercreditor” and “Description of the Class_
_B3 Loan and the Class B4 Loan — Share Enforcement Event” and “Risk_
_Factors – Risks Relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency - The_
_Borrower Security Trustee will only enforce the Borrower Security if it is_
_instructed to do so by the requisite percentage of Class A Noteholders or_
_Class B Noteholders, as the case may be.”_

If at any time either (i) no amounts remain outstanding under any Class A
Notes or (ii) an acceleration of the amounts outstanding under any Class A
Loans has occurred, each of the Share Enforcement Events specified above
will also constitute a Class B Loan Event of Default.

**_Withholding tax on Notes:_** All payments in respect of the Class B5 Notes will be made without
withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes,
levies, duties, imposts, assessments or charges of whatsoever nature unless
the Issuer or any Paying Agent is required by applicable law to make any
payment in respect of the Class B5 Notes subject to any such withholding
or deduction.

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any taxes imposed or
levied by or on behalf of a relevant tax jurisdiction will at any time be
required to be made from any payments made in respect to the Class B5
Notes, including payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price,
interest or premium, the Issuer will, subject to certain exceptions, be
obliged to pay additional amounts in respect of any such withholding or
deduction, such that the net amount received by the holders of the Class B5
Notes is not less than the amount they would have received in the absence
of such withholding.

**_Use of Proceeds:_** The proceeds from the issuance of the Offered Notes are intended to be
used (i) to fund the Refinancing, (ii) towards general corporate purposes
and (iii) to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the Transactions,
including the prepayment premium. See “Use of Proceeds”.

**_Governing law:_** The Class B5 Notes, the Class B5 Loan, the Note Trust Deed, the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Issuer Deed of Charge will be
governed by English law.

**_Absence of public market for the Class B5_** The Offered Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no

**_Notes:_** market. Accordingly there can be no assurance as to the development or

liquidity of any market for the Offered Notes or that a liquid market will be
maintained.

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL FINANCIAL** **AND OPERATING INFORMATION**

_The following tables present summary historical consolidated financial information of Center Parcs (Holdings_
_1) Limited for the periods indicated. This summary historical financial information is based on the audited consolidated_
_financial statements and notes thereto of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited as at and for each of the 52-week periods_
_ended 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 and the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, included elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum, except as noted below. The audit reports, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, express an_
_unqualified opinion for each of the respective periods and the audit report in relation to the financial statements as at and_
_for the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020 includes a material uncertainty paragraph related to going concern as set_
_forth in Note 1 to such financial statements._ _The financial information as at 26 April 2018 has been derived from the_
_comparative period included in the audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the 52-week periods ended 25_
_April 2019. The following summary historical consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with_
_“Selected Consolidated Financial Information,” “Presentation of Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion_
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, as well as the consolidated financial statements and_
_related notes of Center Parcs included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited early adopted IFRS 16 in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and_
_recognised £2.2 million as a reduction in retained earnings as a result of the adoption. Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited_
_early adopted IFRS 16 by applying the modified retrospective approach, which requires the cumulative effect of the initial_
_application of IFRS 16 to be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on 27 April 2018,_
_the date of initial application, without restating prior periods. On adoption, right of use assets and lease liabilities were_
_brought onto the balance sheet for £30.9 million and £33.1 million, respectively, and related depreciation charges and_
_finance expense are recognised in the income statement, instead of operating lease rentals expenses._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 15 in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 using the_
_retrospective method and restating the comparative periods. The effect of adoption of IFRS 15 as at 20 April 2017 was the_
_deferral of £0.8 million of revenue in respect of certain promotional activities that was recognised as a liability at the_
_transition date with a corresponding reduction to retained earnings._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 9 in the 52 weeks period ended 25 April 2019 and in_
_accordance with the standard, the comparative periods were not restated. The adoption of IFRS 9 on 27 April 2018 did_
_not have a material impact in the consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited._

_As a result of the adoption of the above accounting standards and the additional week included in the 53-week_
_period ended 26 April 2018, the audited consolidated financial statements as at and for each of the 52-week periods ended_
_23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 are not directly comparable with the audited consolidated financial statements as at and_
_for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, included in this Offering Memorandum. The audited consolidated financial_
_statements as at and for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018 were prepared in accordance with IAS 18, Revenue, IAS_
_17, Leases and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, which were the standards applicable at that_
_time._

_During the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020, the Center Parcs villages were closed from 20 March 2020 to_
_the end of the period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to facilitate comparability to the 52-week period ended_
_25 April 2019 and the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, certain financial and operational information is presented as_
_of and for the 52-week period from 1 March 2019 to 27 February 2020, which represents the last 52-week period for which_
_management accounts are available and during which all villages were open and operational. Figures for the 52 week_
_period from 1 March 2019 to 27 February 2020 are calculated by adding together the results from the 52-week period_
_ended 25 April 2019 to the results from 26 April 2019 to 27 February 2020 and deducting the results from 27 April 2018_
_to 28 February 2019. In addition, certain comparative figures are also presented as of and for the 52-week period from_
_2 March 2018 to 28 February 2019. These comparative figures are calculated by adding together the results from the 53-_
_week period ended 26 April 2018 to the results from 27 April 2018 to 28 February 2019 and deducting the results from_
_21 April 2017 to 22 February 2018 and the 53-week Adjustment._ _The financial information for the 52-week periods ended_
_27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019 has been extracted from management accounts. The financial information for_
_the 52-week periods ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019 has not been prepared in accordance with IAS 34_
_Interim Financial Reporting and has not been audited or reviewed. Moreover, as certain year-end procedures were not_
_performed in preparing the financial information for the 52-week periods ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019,_
_they may not represent the same financial information that would have resulted if Center Parcs had produced year-end_
_financial statements for the 52-week periods ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019, respectively. See_
_“Presentation of Financial Information.”_

_The summary historical consolidated financial information and the “as adjusted” financial information_
_included below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum is not necessarily indicative of, and does not constitute_
_projections for, the financial results for the Center Parcs Group for any future period. The “as adjusted” financial_

_information is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realised_
_had the Transactions occurred on the dates indicated._

(1) EBITDA before exceptional and non-underlying items is referred to herein as Adjusted EBITDA. See “Presentation of Financial Information—non-IFRS
_Financial and Operating Measures—EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.”_

(2) Exceptional and non-underlying items represented exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses of £2.2 million for the financial year ended
23 April 2020 represented £2.0 million in costs to exit a contract and £0.2 million of legal and other associated costs relating to the equity contribution
provided by the Brookfield Funds. Exceptional and non-underlying items for the financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented exceptional and nonunderlying administrative expenses of £1.6 million of costs relating to legal health and safety claims at Woburn Forest and associated settlements, together
with £0.7 million of one-off restructuring and reorganisation costs.

(3) Exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 represented the £6.1 million premium paid on the settlement of
Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes and £1.6 million in accelerated amortization of deferred issue costs in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class
A3 Notes. Exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses for the financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented the £26.9 million premium paid on the
settlement of Center Parcs’ Class B2 Notes.

(4) Exceptional and non-underlying taxation expense for the financial year ended 23 April 2020 represented the impact of the change in the applicable deferred
tax rate from 17% to 19%, which was partially offset by a taxation credit related to exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses. Exceptional and
non-underlying taxation income for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 represented a £1.5 million tax credit related to break costs and the accelerated
write-off of deferred fees in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes. Exceptional and non-underlying taxation income for the
financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented a £5.3 million tax credit in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class B3 Notes and a £1.9 million
tax credit in respect of a one-off adjustment to group relief relating to restricted interest deductions and subsequent increased capital allowances claims.

**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**

(a) Center Parcs early adopted IFRS 16 in the 52 weeks period ended 25 April 2019, so EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the 52-week periods ended 25
April 2019 and 23 April 2020 may not be directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—IFRS 16” and
“Presentation of Financial Information.”
(b) Center Parcs defines EBITDA as profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. Adjusted
EBITDA is defined as EBITDA as defined above, further adjusted to remove the effects of certain exceptional and non-underlying items that Center Parcs
believes are not indicative of its underlying operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures under IFRS and investors should not
consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as alternatives to (a) operating profit or profit/(loss) for the period as a measure of Center Parcs’ operating
performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of Center Parcs’ ability to meet its cash needs or (c) any other
measures of performance under IFRS. Investors should evaluate each adjustment and the reasons Center Parcs considers it appropriate as a method of
supplemental analysis. In evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that, as an analytical tool, EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA are each subject to certain limitations. See “Presentation of Financial Information — Non-IFRS Financial Measures”. In addition, investors
should be aware that Center Parcs is likely to incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation in the future and that certain of these items could
be considered recurring in nature. Center Parcs’ presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be
unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. For further information, see the discussions on exceptional items in Center Parcs’ financial statements and
related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.
(c) Exceptional and non-underlying items represented exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses of £2.2 million for the financial year ended
23 April 2020 represented £2.0 million in costs to exit a contract and £0.2 million of legal and other associated costs relating to the equity contribution
provided by the Brookfield Funds. Exceptional and non-underlying items for the financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented exceptional and nonunderlying administrative expenses of £1.6 million of costs relating to legal health and safety claims at Woburn Forest and associated settlements, together
with £0.7 million of one-off restructuring and reorganisation costs.

(1) Center Parcs adopted IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ starting on 27 April 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Center Parcs recognises a right-of-use asset
and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease
term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, Center Parcs recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the
leased asset are consumed.

_in this section. This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties._
_The Center Parcs Group’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements_
_as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by the Center Parcs Group described below and elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**RISKS RELATING TO CENTER PARCS’ BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY**

**_The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect Center Parcs’_**
**_business, financial condition and results of operations._**

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected and is expected to continue to significantly affect the travel
and hospitality industry in the United Kingdom for a significant but undetermined period of time. The current impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic as well as its uncertain future impact, including its effect on the ability or desire of people to
travel and to stay at holiday villages, may negatively affect Center Parcs’ results, operations, outlook, plans, growth, cash
flows and liquidity.

Center Parcs has been and expects to continue to be adversely impacted by governmental efforts to contain the
COVID-19 pandemic, including stay-at-home measures and social distancing requirements. Due to COVID-19 concerns,
all of Center Parcs’ villages were closed from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020. As a result, Center Parcs recorded no revenue
during this period. In addition, a majority of guests with bookings for this period requested refunds from Center Parcs
instead of choosing to postpone their holidays. These refunds had a negative impact on Center Parcs’ cash flows. Center
Parcs expects additional health and safety regulations that the UK government has enacted or may enact in the future in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to affect Center Parcs’ holiday villages. Such regulations are expected to
increase Center Parcs’ operating costs and compliance burden. While Center Parcs believes it is in compliance with current
regulations, future regulations and guidelines may be more onerous and there can be no assurance that such regulations
and guidelines will not further restrict Center Parcs’ ability to operate its villages.

Since reopening on 13 July 2020, Center Parcs has implemented significant operational changes in accordance
with government health and safety regulations. Center Parcs’ villages are operating at reduced capacity levels appropriate
to ensure proper application of government requirements and Center Parcs has implemented enhanced health and safety
measures such as hand sanitisation stations, deep cleaning of accommodation between departing and arriving guests and
increased cleaning and disinfection of public areas. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, a small number of Center
Parcs’ leisure activities remain unavailable to guests. Center Parcs continues to review and amend its operating procedures,
prioritising guest and employee safety. These operational changes are likely to result in a decrease in revenue, due to the
reduction in capacity, as well additional operating expenses.

A localised outbreak among guests or employees at any of Center Parcs’ villages could lead to a further period of
closure for the affected village and in other regulatory intervention. Such an outbreak could adversely affect Center Parcs’
reputation or affect guests’ willingness to book future holidays. An outbreak at any of its villages could also give rise to
legal claims from employees and guests in connection with the adequacy of Center Parcs’ response to COVID-19. In
addition, any outbreak in the UK could increase cancellations and affect guest demand for holidays. Local governments in
the UK may also exercise their power to contain the spread of COVID-19 by preventing travel into and out of localities
and shutting down venues such as Center Parcs’ villages.

In addition, as a result of existing social distancing requirements, as well as future regulations that may be
promulgated to contain COVID-19, Center Parcs cannot be certain when it will be able to fully reopen all facilities and
amenities at its holiday villages, and what public health and safety requirements it will be required to implement in the
future. Such regulations could adversely impact Center Parcs’ ability to operate at full capacity and to offer all of the
services, facilities and amenities guests typically expect at Center Parcs’ holiday villages. Current and any future
restrictions on facilities and amenities may have a negative impact on customer experience and satisfaction. In addition,
customers may either cancel their bookings or seek discounted pricing for Center Parcs’ offerings as a result of the
limitations on availability of certain facilities and amenities, which could adversely affect Center Parcs’ revenues and cash

34


-----

flow. As long as such facilities and amenities remain closed, there is a risk that Center Parcs may be required to refund
guests that wish to cancel their bookings. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, in accordance with its terms and
conditions, Center Parcs offers guests the options of a free change of date or a full refund for guests who choose to cancel
their breaks.

The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic restricts Center Parcs’ ability to make accurate financial
and operational forecasts. Center Parcs has never previously closed all five villages and ceased all non-essential operating
expenses. As a result, Center Parcs has limited ability to be predictive of the near-term and medium-term impact of COVID19 on occupancy, RevPAL, guest expenditures and operating costs. There remains material uncertainty about the effects
of the closure and any future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of such uncertainties, Center Parcs’ past
performance should not be considered an indication of its future performance.

The closure of Center Parcs’ villages and expected staged reopening process due to COVID-19 has adversely
impacted Center Parcs’ ability to generate sufficient cash flows and liquidity position. As a result, since April 2020, the
Brookfield Funds have provided equity contributions of £69 million, comprising £41.5 million received in April 2020 and
£27.5 million received in May 2020, and the Intercompany Account Advance of £70 million received on 14 July 2020 to
support Center Parcs. If Center Parcs cannot generate sufficient cash flow in the future due to the effects of COVID-19, or
for other reasons, then Center Parcs may be reliant on Brookfield to contribute additional capital to support the business
and allow it to meet its operating expenses and debt payments. If Brookfield declines to or is unable to provide such
additional capital contributions, Center Parcs may not be able to meet its required expenditures, including operating
expenses, capital expenditures and debt payments.

In accordance with the UK government’s CJRS, Center Parcs furloughed approximately 90% of its employees
from 27 March 2020 until 3 July 2020. As at 4 September 2020, less than 1% of Center Parcs’ employees remained on
furlough following the re-opening of the villages. There is a risk that some of Center Parcs employees may not return
following the end of the furlough period or the end of the CJRS. If future closure of Center Parcs’ villages were to be
required due to COVID-19, government regulations or otherwise, or if the CJRS were unavailable to Center Parcs, or if
Center Parcs’ business otherwise deteriorates, Center Parcs cannot assure that it would be able to retain all of its employees.
Further, if schools remain or are closed in response to COVID-19 or otherwise, employee absentee rates may increase due
to employees who are parents not being able to find suitable childcare options to allow them to continue or return to their
previous employment activities. Higher absence rates could result in increased payroll costs for Center Parcs. In addition,
higher employee absence rates and lower employee retention could impact adversely affect customer experience as well as
employee satisfaction. See “—Center Parcs’ business could be harmed if it loses the services of its key management
_personnel or is unable to attract and retain qualified employees.”_

If the UK government agrees to provide further crisis relief assistance that Center Parcs’ accepts in response to
prolonged or additional COVID-19 outbreaks, it may impose certain requirements on the recipients of the aid, including
restrictions on executive officer compensation, dividends, prepayment of debt, limitations on debt and other similar
restrictions that would apply for a period of time after the aid is repaid or redeemed in full.

The revenue loss resulting from the closure of Center Parcs’ villages due to the COVID-19 pandemic was not
covered by Center Parcs’ insurance. As a result, Center Parcs’ will not be able to recoup lost revenue due to the closure of
its villages during its closure from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020, and may not be covered for any future closures resulting
from new government guidance or a new outbreak of COVID-19. See “—Center Parcs’ insurance coverage may not be
_adequate to cover all possible losses that it could suffer, and its insurance costs may increase.”_

Center Parcs’ business is sensitive to economic downturns and the corresponding impact on discretionary
consumer spending. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental measures to contain it have adversely affected UK
economic activity, including consumer spending and travel demand. UK gross domestic product decreased by 2.2%
between January and March 2020 and decreased by a further 20.4% between April and June 2020, as the UK economy
entered into a recession. There is a risk that the UK economy may take multiple years to recover from the COVID-19
pandemic. Any actual or perceived deterioration or weakness in economic conditions, consumer debt levels or consumer
confidence, due to COVID-19 or otherwise, may lead to Center Parcs’ customers having less discretionary income to spend
on recreation activities and discretionary travel.

There is material uncertainty about the short-term and long-term effects of the COVID-19 crisis on travel demand.
Actual or perceived risks of infection could cause travel demand, including demand for a holiday village experience, to
remain weak for a significant length of time. Center Parcs cannot predict if or when UK travel demand will return to preoutbreak levels. The COVID-19 pandemic may also alter customer expectations and preferences in other ways, including
guest expectations related to health and safety measures at holiday villages. The form, extent and duration of such impacts
remain largely uncertain. In addition, should a second wave or further outbreaks of COVID-19 materialise, the impact of
such outbreaks may have a material effect on Center Parcs’ business and results of operations including as a result of the
closure of one or more of its villages.

Although Fitch affirmed the Issuer’s credit rating on 18 June 2020 and S&P affirmed the BBB credit rating of the
Issuer’s Class A Notes on 16 July 2020, the credit rating of the Issuer’s Class B Notes was downgraded to B- on
16 July 2020 by S&P. If the Issuer’s credit ratings were to be further downgraded, or general market conditions were to
ascribe higher risk to the Issuer’s rating levels, the hospitality industry, or Center Parcs itself, the Issuer’s (and therefore
Center Parcs’) access to capital and the cost of any debt financing would be further negatively impacted. See “—Ratings
_Agency assessments, downgrades and changes to Rating Agencies’ criteria may result in ratings volatility on the Offered_
_Notes.”_

In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, which may further
restrict Center Parcs’ ability to operate its business or restrict access to additional financing due to its covenant restrictions
then in effect. There is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund Center Parcs’ obligations,
or that they will be available on terms consistent with Center Parcs’ expectations. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19
on the financial markets, including the debt capital markets, could adversely impact Center Parcs’ ability to raise funds
through financings.

The effect of the global COVID-19 pandemic on Center Parcs’ business and the wider hospitality industry will
ultimately depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak and the
length of time it takes for demand and pricing to return and for normal economic and operating conditions to resume. There
are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and, as a
result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is uncertain and subject to change. Even after the current outbreak of COVID19 subsides, Center Parcs could still experience long-term impacts on operating costs as a result of attempts to counteract
future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other epidemics, including for example enhanced health and safety requirements or other
measures. If a future outbreak of COVID-19 were to occur, the impact to Center Parcs is uncertain and unpredictable. The
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may therefore have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ financial condition,
results of operations and business.

**_As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is material uncertainty about Center Parcs’ ability_**
**_to continue as a going concern._**

Center Parcs’ 2020 Audited Financial Statements were prepared on a going concern basis. The going concern
basis contemplates realisation of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and does not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty regarding Center Parcs’ ability to continue
as such. However, given that the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, there exists a material uncertainty related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt about Center Parcs’ ability to continue as a going concern.

Despite the liquidity support provided by Brookfield thus far, uncertainty remains with regards forecasting both
the pace of recovery and the eventual levels to which trading will return and accordingly it is possible that further funding
will be required and Center Parcs may not be able to secure such additional funding. Depending on how quickly Center
Parcs’ trading recovers or if there are further government-imposed restrictions that result in the closure of one or more
villages for a period of time, there is a risk that existing financial covenants under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement or the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will be breached. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum,
there remains a requirement to ensure certain social distancing measures are in place and certain activities are not as yet
able to operate. As a result, these measures may have a significant impact on the format of the breaks in the near term.
While there are indications of strong demand for the Group’s breaks with bookings for the fourth quarter (including
bookings that have been moved with a financial incentive from the COVID-19 closure period) significantly ahead of the
prior year, the ability to initially operate at the previous high levels of occupancy will be restricted. These make it
challenging for Center Parcs to accurately forecast its cash flows.

If one or more of Center Parcs’ assumptions in making its assessment to report as a going concern are found to be
incorrect, Center Parcs may be unable to continue as a going concern. For additional detail, see Note 1 to the 2020 Audited
Financial Statements and “Summary—Recent Developments—Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic.” If Center Parcs is unable
to continue as a going concern, it would have to liquidate its assets and may receive less than the value at which those
assets are carried on Center Parcs’ audited financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose a part or all of their
investment in the Offered Notes.

**_Center Parcs derives its revenue from operating its villages. Any failure to manage its villages effectively or_**
**_any significant business interruption or other event affecting the operation of one or more of its villages may have a_**
**_material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Center Parcs operates five holiday villages in England. Any significant business interruption at any of its villages,
such as the closure of all five holiday villages from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ financial condition and results of operations. Although Center Parcs
has risk management arrangements, including business continuity plans, in place, such risk management arrangements, or

36


-----

any insurance may not adequately protect Center Parcs from significant interruption of business at any one or more of the
villages. In addition, Center Parcs may not be able to obtain planning permission or planning consent to rebuild properties
if destroyed, regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds. A significant interruption or event could be created by
any number of internal or external factors, including fire (as occurred at the Elveden village in 2002, resulting in a 15month closure), extreme weather conditions, accidents, loss of utilities or other interruptions, such as the COVID-19
pandemic. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect Center Parcs’
_business, financial condition and results of operations.” Due to the full service, self-contained nature of its villages, Center_
Parcs maintains significant infrastructure, including water supply, electricity and waste water treatment, and any failure to
adequately develop and maintain these facilities could also result in a significant business interruption. Such interruptions
and events may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely
affected by a number of factors relating to the operation of any village or the guest perception or expectation of the operating
activities in a particular village. Factors that relate specifically to a particular village could include, amongst others:

       - the age, design, construction quality and maintenance of the village;

        - perceptions regarding the attractiveness of the village;

        - the proximity and attractiveness of competing UK holiday centres;

        - the proximity of other developments and infrastructure projects, for example, power stations or road
projects, which adversely impacts guest experiences;

        - increases in operating expenses;

       - inability to pass on to guests any significant unforeseen input costs, such as utility costs, that would erode
Center Parcs’ margins;

       - an increase in the capital expenditure needed to maintain the village or make improvements, or to maintain
the competitiveness of the villages;

        - an outbreak of COVID-19 or a notifiable illness, food poisoning or drinking water contamination at any
village;

        - major village damage or disruption including natural or environmental disasters;

        - bad or extreme weather conditions;

       - an illness, disease or event that damages the forest, fauna and natural environment surrounding a village;

       - guest health and safety issues, such as inadequate or untimely first aid responses, accidents, personal injuries
or child abuse or abduction;

       - burglaries or thefts of personal belongings from village accommodation or facilities;

        - a fluctuation or decline, seasonal or otherwise, in demand for the facilities that the village offers;

        - increases in development and construction costs or delays in completion schedules;

        - disturbances to guests’ experiences caused by new build, maintenance or refurbishment projects; and

        - negative publicity or guest perceptions about any village due to the above-mentioned factors or otherwise.

Center Parcs’ effective management and operation of the villages has a significant impact on the revenues,
expenses and value of the villages. Any failure to manage Center Parcs’ operations effectively, including any failure to
anticipate and react to the above-mentioned factors may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Governmental regulation may adversely affect Center Parcs’ existing and future operations and results._**

Center Parcs is subject to various national and local regulations that have affected, and will continue to affect, its
operations. Each of its holiday villages is subject to national and local licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, food
and workplace safety, and other agencies. Center Parcs has been and expects to continue to be adversely impacted by
governmental efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, including stay-at-home measures and social distancing
requirements. Further, there is a material risk that the UK government may in the future require the closure of Center Parcs’

37


-----

villages or impose further restrictions on travel and distancing in order to manage the spread of COVID-19. See “—The
_COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect Center Parcs’ business, financial_
_condition and results of operations.”_ Its operations are also subject to regulations which govern such matters as the
minimum wage, national living wage, overtime and other working conditions, along with parental leave and a variety of
similar laws enacted to govern these and other employment law matters.

The UK government introduced a national living wage in the 2015 budget, which has applied to employees aged
25 and over since April 2016, and includes further phased increases in April of every year. Center Parcs extended a similar
wage increase to employees under the age of 25 as well. This increase in wages resulted in higher personnel costs and is
expected to result in further increase in personnel costs going forward. Changes to such laws and regulations, including
further increases to the minimum wage or national living wage, could have a materially adverse impact on Center Parcs’
existing and future operations and results.

Center Parcs is also subject to the Equality Act 2010, which gives civil rights protections to individuals with
disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodation and other areas. Center Parcs may in the future have to
modify its villages to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. The expenses associated
with these modifications could be material. Regulations and laws, or the way in which they are interpreted, may become
more stringent over time, which could require new capital expenditures and result in an increase in its operating costs.

**_Center Parcs’ business depends on the public perception of its brand. Any event at any village negatively_**
**_affecting guest perception or expectation will likely negatively affect guest perception of the other Center Parcs villages._**

The success of Center Parcs’ business depends on the public perception of the Center Parcs brand. Any event or
occurrence at any one village that negatively affects guest perceptions is likely to negatively affect guest perceptions of the
other Center Parcs villages. Center Parcs villages feature activities such as water activities, paintballing, laser combat,
horse riding, abseiling, zip wiring and quadbiking that pose a potential risk of accident and serious personal injury. If a
serious personal injury were to occur at one of the holiday villages, attendance at the holiday villages and, consequently,
revenues might be materially adversely affected. In addition, holidays at Center Parcs’ villages involve guest services and
guest interactions, including with respect to bookings, accommodation services, on-site activities and food and beverage
provisions. A pattern of poor or unsatisfactory guest service, guest complaints or poor reviews on social media at any of
the villages could result in reputational harm to the Center Parcs brand. The considerable expansion in the use of social
media over recent years has compounded the potential scope and speed of the negative publicity that could be generated
by such incidents or events. Any accident, interruption, serious disturbance or negative publicity at Center Parcs’ holiday
villages, or a perception that the facilities are unsafe or operate in an unsafe manner, may reduce attendance at or demand
for its holiday villages, which would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Longford Forest in the Republic of Ireland opened in 2019. Although Longford Forest is outside of the Obligor
Group, any incidents at Longford Forest, such as poor reviews, or any future incidents such as those described above, could
have a negative impact on the perception of Center Parcs in general and therefore on its results of operations.

If any such accidents or injuries do occur, Center Parcs’ insurance may not adequately cover the costs stemming
from such accidents and injuries or other disturbances and incidents. Center Parcs could also face legal claims related to
these events, as well as adverse publicity that could be generated by such incidents. Accidents or injuries could also require
upgrades, modifications or demolition of affected facilities, which could result in significant costs to Center Parcs and
disrupt operations, which could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of
operations.

In addition, Center Parcs sells food and beverages, toys and other retail products, the sale of which involves legal
and other risks. As a reseller of food and retail merchandise, Center Parcs may be liable if the consumption or purchase of
any of the products it sells causes illness or injury. Furthermore, any product recall could result in losses due to the cost of
the recall, the destruction of product and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. A significant
food, toy, gift or other retail product recall could also result in adverse publicity, damage to Center Parcs’ reputation and
loss of consumer confidence in its villages, which could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Center Parcs targets affluent family-focused guests with historically approximately 80% of Center Parcs’ guests
being families with children. In order to provide an environment that is attractive to this core group of guests, Center Parcs
strives to maintain a balanced guest profile of, amongst others, families, adult groups and corporate events. If guests’
behaviour is disruptive or otherwise affects the enjoyment of other guests, this could result in adverse publicity and damage
to Center Parcs’ reputation. A failure to attract Center Parcs’ core demographic of affluent guests with families could have
a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial conditions and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs’ business is currently located entirely in England. As a result, changes in the British holiday_**
**_market, including as a result of Brexit, may have a more significant adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations than on more geographically diverse holiday businesses._**

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and its subsidiaries currently operate entirely in England. Accordingly, Center
Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations may be significantly adversely affected by a number of factors,
including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK and the UK’s exit from the European Union on
31 January 2020 (“Brexit”), that affect the UK holiday market, including:

        - national, regional or local economic conditions;

        - socioeconomic and demographic factors;

       - consumer confidence and personal disposable income;

        - exchange rate fluctuations or other factors which impact tourism or travel to or within the UK;

        - significant increases in utility and fuel costs;

       - local holiday market conditions from time to time (such as an over-supply or under-supply of holiday resort
accommodation and facilities);

       - consumer tastes and preferences;

        - changes in governmental regulations, fiscal policy, planning/zoning or tax laws and building codes as well
as other regulatory changes;

        - changes in minimum wage legislation or other factors increasing operational costs;

        - potential environmental legislation or liabilities or other legal liabilities;

        - acts of terrorism, natural disasters and direct political action; or

        - further instances of illness, epidemics or pandemics.

All Center Parcs’ villages are currently located in England and, consequently, the level of revenue and profit
generated by the villages could be substantially influenced by general economic conditions in the United Kingdom. While
Center Parcs’ revenues increased in each of financial years 2018 and 2019, Center Parcs’ revenues were lower in financial
year 2020 due to closure of all five villages in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Center Parcs expects revenues may
further decline in financial year 2021 due to the closure of the villages until 13 July 2020 and the more limited capacity
offered upon reopening. Center Parcs cannot guarantee that revenue will return to growth in future periods or that any such
growth will be sustained. The villages have certain fixed operating costs, and as a result decreases in revenue may result
in a significant decline in net cash flow, as seen during the period from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020 when the villages
were closed as a result of COVID-19. In addition, a significant or sustained decline in economic conditions or high rates
of inflation, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or Brexit or uncertainty in the period leading up to the end
of the UK’s Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020 (the “Brexit Transition Period”), could adversely affect Center
Parcs’ ability to obtain goods and services from suppliers or credit from financing sources and could impact the ability of
third parties, including insurance carriers and credit providers, to meet their obligations to Center Parcs. Weak economic
conditions generally in the United Kingdom, or in any regional market from which a particular village attracts guests, may
adversely affect holiday centre occupancy, guest spending patterns and Center Parcs’ general business and financial
condition. Conversely, if general economic conditions in the United Kingdom were to improve significantly, there may be
greater consumer preference for holidays abroad.

The disposable income of Center Parcs’ guests and/or their holiday preferences may be affected by changes in the
general economic environment. Any decrease in disposable income of Center Parcs’ guests, such as that due to the
economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in a decline in the number of guests and/or a
decrease in on-site spending. Even if economic conditions are stable or improving, a negative economic outlook, including
the fear of another recession, concerns about another wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or concerns regarding falling
living standards, may adversely affect consumer spending and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’
business, financial condition and results of operations.

The United Kingdom held a referendum on 23 June 2016, to determine whether the United Kingdom should leave
the European Union or remain as a member state, and the outcome of that referendum was in favour of Brexit. On 31
January 2020, the United Kingdom formally left the European Union and entered the Brexit Transition Period. Until the
end of the Brexit Transition Period, European Union laws and regulations will continue to apply in the United Kingdom,
and changes to the application of these laws and regulations are unlikely to occur during negotiations. However, due to the
size and importance of the UK economy, and the uncertainty and unpredictability concerning the United Kingdom’s legal,
political and economic relationship with Europe after the end of the Brexit Transition Period, there may continue to be
instability in the market, significant currency fluctuations, and/or otherwise adverse effects on trading agreements or similar
cross-border cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the foreseeable
future, including beyond the date that the United Kingdom ceases to be a Member State of the European Union.

These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material
adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce
global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. In addition,
Brexit may lead to or exacerbate a down-turn in the United Kingdom or other European economies and could lead to lower
levels of consumer spending if consumer confidence declines or if individuals have less disposable income. Any reduction
in customers’ willingness or ability to spend due to Brexit-related changes in the economic environment of the United
Kingdom and Europe could materially affect Center Parcs’ revenue. A further slow-down in the UK economy due to Brexit
may also negatively impact Center Parcs’ growth strategies as well as its operating results, financial condition and
prospects.

Uncertainty surrounding Brexit has also led to a decrease in the exchange rate of the pound sterling against the
euro following the 2016 referendum and continued or sustained adverse effects on the exchange rate of the pound sterling
as compared to foreign currencies and the effective price inflation of certain goods and services sourced from outside of
the United Kingdom resulting from Brexit could result in increased costs for Center Parcs.

While Center Parcs does not currently employ a large number of EU nationals in its UK villages, the outcome of
Brexit negotiations surrounding free movement of EU and UK nationals and any subsequent visa requirements may have
an adverse effect on EU nationals’ ability to work in the United Kingdom. Depending on prevailing visa arrangements EU
nationals may find it more difficult to work in the UK, which in turn could lead to a tightening of the labour markets and a
subsequent increase in salaries and wages in order to stay competitive. Any such increase in salaries and wages or in
benefits offered to employees could result in increased costs.

Lack of clarity about future UK laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union
laws to replace or replicate following the expiration of the Brexit Transition Period, including financial laws and
regulations, data privacy and collection laws and regulations and customs and free trade agreements, may increase costs
associated with operating in the United Kingdom. Additionally, any substantial change in the regulations applicable to
Center Parcs’ business could jeopardise its ability to continue to operate in a manner consistent with its past practice.

Any of these factors or other events or consequences from Brexit described above may have a material adverse
effect on Center Parcs' business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Center Parcs relies on information technology in its operations and any material failure, inadequacy,_**
**_interruption or breach of security of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate its business and subject_**
**_it to data loss, litigation, liability and reputational harm._**

Center Parcs relies on its information systems across its operations, such as in the processing of payment details,
and on those of its third parties service providers, including the online booking systems provided by ATCORE and Elite.
Its ability to effectively manage its business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. A new
website which provides information and booking services for Center Parcs’ spas and a new Center Parcs website, which
was rolled out in 2017, utilise the Adobe platform. Extended or widespread outages of the online accommodation or
activities booking system (including the self-service booking points on-site) could adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to
take guest bookings (as online bookings can be made exclusively through its website).

The provision of convenient, trusted, fast and effective payment processing services to Center Parcs’ guests is
critical to its business. If there is any deterioration in the quality of the payment processing services provided to Center
Parcs’ guests or any interruption to those services, or if such services are only available at an increased cost to Center Parcs
or its guests or are terminated and no timely and comparable replacement services are found, Center Parcs’ guests may be
deterred from booking Center Parcs breaks.

Center Parcs, and third-party service providers on its behalf, collect, process and retain large volumes of guest
data, which, together with employee data and other confidential information, is entered into, processed, summarised and

40


-----

reported by various information systems. Center Parcs also uses video surveillance in certain public areas for security
purposes. The footage from such surveillance is also subject to data protection and privacy laws.

Notwithstanding the efforts and technology of Center Parcs and its third-party service providers to secure their
computer networks, the security of those networks could be compromised. Third parties may have the technology or knowhow to breach the security of Center Parcs’ guest, employee and other confidential information, and Center Parcs’ security
measures (or those of its third-party service providers) may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access
to this information, destroying or stealing valuable information or disrupting Center Parcs’ operations. In addition, Center
Parcs or any of its third-party service providers may lose data, including guest data and payment details, or may fail to
transmit such data online in a secure manner. In each case, if any theft or loss of personal guest data were to occur, Center
Parcs could face liability (including fines) under data protection or privacy laws and lose the goodwill of its guests,
incurring significant reputational harm. Such security breaches could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’
business, financial condition and results of operations.

If the guest, employee or other data held by Center Parcs is not accurate or complete, there is a risk that Center
Parcs could make incorrect decisions regarding marketing, pricing, cost management or other factors that impact its
financial performance.

Any computer virus, security breach, loss, or theft of company, guest or employee data could expose Center Parcs
to adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, regulatory action, or cause Center Parcs to incur significant costs to reimburse
third parties for damages, which could impact its results of operations.

**_Center Parcs competes for discretionary spending with other holiday offerings and holiday or leisure_**
**_alternatives._**

The UK domestic holiday market is diverse. Center Parcs’ main competitors are high-end, self-catering cottage
accommodation and leisure hotels and resorts, primarily in the UK, and to a lesser extent abroad. Center Parcs’ holiday
villages compete for guests’ discretionary spending with other holiday offerings, including other holiday villages (both UK
traditional holiday villages and holiday parks and UK and international destination parks). In addition, other holiday
providers could open forest villages in the UK in the future. A village’s ability to attract guests depends, among other
things, on the quality of the accommodation, competitiveness of prices, amenities and facilities offered and the convenience
and location of the village. If competing UK holiday centres provide a better offering to guests, this may have a material
adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations, which may in turn affect the ability
of the Obligors to meet their obligations under the Loans and the Issuer’s ability to meet its obligations under the Notes.

Since the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two-hour drive of the village they choose to visit, the
effects of competition would be more pronounced if a new holiday centre or other guest attraction opened within close
proximity to one of Center Parcs’ holiday villages or if an existing holiday centre expanded into its market or began
conducting activities aimed at capturing Center Parcs’ market share.

In addition, Center Parcs may face increased competition from holiday offerings outside the UK as a result of an
increase in the convenience or reduction in the cost of air travel, particularly due to the decline in global oil prices, any
appreciation of the pound relative to other currencies, particularly the euro, or inclement weather in the UK. In addition, if
macroeconomic conditions are strong and/or inflation in the UK declines, there may be greater consumer preference for
holidays abroad. Further, Longford Forest in the Republic of Ireland may attract guests away from Center Parcs’ existing
villages. Reduced occupancy at Center Parcs’ existing villages for any of the above reasons may have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition and results of operations of Center Parcs.

Center Parcs also competes more broadly with other types of leisure activities and forms of entertainment, such
as sports and other recreational activities, restaurants, bars, retail outlets and spa facilities.

One or more of Center Parcs’ competitors for holiday or leisure activities may be more successful in attracting
and retaining guests. If Center Parcs does not compete successfully for discretionary spending with other holiday villages
and other leisure alternatives, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

**_Center Parcs could be adversely affected by changes in consumer tastes and expectations or its failure to_**
**_maintain and improve its villages and amenities to appeal to changing guest tastes and expectations._**

The success of Center Parcs’ holiday villages depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that can
change in unpredictable ways, and on Center Parcs’ ability to ensure that its holiday villages meet the changing preferences
of its target guests. Evolving standards of accommodation and amenities and changing guest expectations, such as with
regards to social distancing and personal protective equipment, may also affect the revenues and popularity of Center Parcs’
villages, which require continued investment to ensure that the accommodation and amenities in the villages are attractive
and appeal to Center Parcs’ guests. Center Parcs carries out significant research and analysis before constructing new

41


-----

holiday villages or opening new facilities at its villages and often invests substantial amounts in investigating how these
new holiday villages and new facilities may be perceived by guests. If Center Parcs’ facilities or new entertainment and
leisure activity offerings do not achieve targeted guest volumes, revenues may decline. Any failure to invest, innovate or
continue to improve Center Parcs’ offering in a timely manner to meet changing consumer preferences or to retain longterm guest loyalty or provide satisfactory guest service may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,
financial condition and result of operations.

**_Bad or extreme weather conditions, road, rail or other transportation disruptions or closures and other_**
**_conditions out of Center Parcs’ control could negatively affect occupancy at Center Parcs’ villages._**

Center Parcs’ holiday villages provide both indoor and outdoor activities, with the natural setting of the villages
and the outdoor activities a major draw for guests. However, due to social distancing requirements and other regulations
by the UK government in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of Center Parcs’ activities currently remain closed. Bad
weather or forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions can reduce the number of people who come to the holiday villages
or who book stays, which may require Center Parcs to lower prices thus reducing ADR even if occupancy remains stable.
In addition, due to the often unexpected nature of bad or extreme weather conditions, Center Parcs may fail to predict or
undertake the appropriate advanced planning to maintain business operations in the event of a disruption due to bad or
extreme weather conditions. Any such condition could also adversely affect guests’ experiences during their stay at Center
Parcs and thereby affect their willingness to return to Center Parcs as repeat guests. Bad or extreme weather conditions (for
example, floods, storms or high winds) or other occurrences outside of Center Parcs’ control (such as fires) could also lead
to the loss of use of one or more of Center Parcs’ villages, or damage the natural environment in which the villages are
situated, and disrupt its ability to attract guests to certain of Center Parcs’ villages or facilities. Due to such conditions or
for other weather-related or environmental reasons, Center Parcs’ facilities and activities may close from time to time.

The occurrence of extreme winter weather conditions could cause significant damage to Center Parcs’ holiday
villages, which could materially and adversely affect its overall business. Similarly, unseasonably high temperatures and
high winds could exacerbate forest fires. In addition, prolonged drought conditions may cause water shortages, which could
adversely impact the operation of Center Parcs’ water amenities. Center Parcs’ insurance may not be sufficient to cover
the costs of repairing or replacing damaged property or equipment, and Center Parcs may suffer a significant decline in
revenues if any of its holiday villages is closed or unable to operate all of its facilities for an extended period of time.

The heavy snowfall and unusually low temperatures in England in March 2018 caused the temporary closure of
Longleat Forest and restricted guest arrivals and activities at all other villages. In February 2019, Longleat Forest was
closed again for a three-night period due to heavy snowfall. Guests impacted by the snow were issued refunds of both their
accommodation and on-site spend. Center Parcs believes that it experienced lost revenue from the closures in the 53-week
period ended 26 April 2018 and in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019, respectively.

Road closures or detours as a result of bad weather conditions may also prevent or delay Center Parcs’ guests,
who primarily drive to the villages, from reaching the villages. Road closures and detours have the potential of extending
the effects of bad weather beyond the particular storm or weather condition as damaged roads and highways may take
significant time to repair. Additionally, road closures and detours as a result of non-weather factors, such as government
repair works, may also reduce the number of guests.

If transport links to Center Parcs’ holiday villages and related infrastructure are damaged or become inadequate,
guests may face difficulty in traveling to the villages, or may face significant delays and increased travel times, which
could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs’ revenues are highest during school holidays and public holidays, which could magnify the_**
**_impact of adverse conditions or events that occur during peak demand periods._**

Center Parcs’ revenues are subject to seasonal factors and guest demand for breaks increases during school
holidays, public holidays and periods of expected favourable weather conditions, among other things, during which Center
Parcs is generally able to charge higher prices. As a result, if extreme weather, accidents or other adverse conditions or
events occur, particularly during peak holiday periods, Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations
may be materially adversely affected. For example, the period from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020 when the villages were
closed as a result of COVID-19 included periods that have historically been very profitable, including Easter holidays and
May half-term Additionally, changes in school holiday schedules or a switch to a uniform year-round schedule could
adversely affect Center Parcs’ guest bookings, and consequently its attendance levels or target pricing levels during the
peak holiday periods, which may adversely affect Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, any such adverse effect or condition may make it difficult for Center Parcs to predict its operating results, which
may materially and adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to implement planned capital expenditures.

In the United Kingdom, there has been an increasing trend of the government seeking to ban or deter term-time
holidays for school children. In 2017, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom upheld fines, and local authorities continue

42


-----

to use fines, penalising parents taking their children out of school during term-time in the absence of exceptional
circumstances. In financial year 2020, approximately 48% of Center Parcs’ customers were families with at least one
school-age child. However, this number is likely to decline if the trend of increasingly strict regulations and enforcement
surrounding term-time holidays continues. This may result in lower demand for Center Parcs’ villages during off-peak
periods and cause Center Parcs to further reduce off-peak prices, thereby decreasing margins.

**_Instances of injuries, illness, epidemics or pandemics, as well as negative publicity relating thereto, could result_**
**_in reduced guest attendance and materially and adversely impact Center Parcs’ business._**

As seen with the current COVID-19 pandemic, the outbreak of any prolonged pandemic or epidemic disease,
whether a further outbreak of COVID-19 or any other disease, or the occurrence of any other public health concern could
negatively impact the public’s willingness to gather in public spaces or travel or result in health or other government
authorities imposing restrictions on travel, which individually or together could reduce guest volumes or revenues at Center
Parcs’ holiday villages. In addition, any such public health concerns may severely restrict the level of economic activity in
affected areas. Any of these events, particularly if they occur during the peak holiday periods, or the booking periods
thereof, could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

Instances of illness or injury in general or claims of illness relating to food or drinking water quality or handling
at restaurants, food preparation centres or holiday centres, whether or not affecting Center Parcs’ villages, or in relation to
water quality within pools and spas could reduce guest attendance materially, either through cancellations of existing
bookings or by reducing consumer willingness to visit Center Parcs. In addition, any negative publicity relating to these
and other health-related matters might affect consumers’ perceptions of Center Parcs’ holiday villages and reduce guest
visits to its holiday villages.

**_Center Parcs’ insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that it could suffer, and its_**
**_insurance costs may increase._**

Companies engaged in the holiday centre business may be sued for substantial damages in the event of an actual
or alleged accident. A catastrophic loss or accident occurring at Center Parcs’ holiday villages or at competing holiday
villages may increase insurance premiums, and negatively impact Center Parcs’ operating results. Although Center Parcs
carries annual liability insurance to cover this risk, its coverage may not be adequate to cover liabilities, and it may not be
able to obtain adequate coverage should a catastrophic incident occur.

In particular, the lost revenue and increased operating costs resulting from closure of Center Parcs’ villages due
to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing health and safety regulations were not covered by Center Parcs’ insurance policies.
Any future losses resulting from additional closures or reductions in Center Parcs’ operations pursuant to government
regulations or further outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic are not expected to be covered by Center Parcs’ insurance
policies. Further, Center Parcs cannot predict how its insurance policies will change as a result of the macroeconomic
environment and other challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is possible that Center Parcs’ insurance
premiums may increase and that the scope of coverage of Center Parcs’ insurance policies may decrease.

Center Parcs utilises a combination of self-insurance (through the use of large excesses payable by Center Parcs)
and insurance coverage programmes for property, business interruption, employer’s liability, public/products liability and
health care insurance. Pursuant to such programmes, Center Parcs is responsible for a specified amount of claims and
insures for claims above such limits.

Potential liabilities that Center Parcs self-insures or buys commercial insurance for could increase in the future.
In addition, insurance may not be available to Center Parcs on commercially acceptable terms or at all, or Center Parcs
could experience increases in the cost of such insurance. Any increase in the number of claims or amount per claim or
increase in the cost of insurance could materially and adversely affect Center Parcs’ results of operations.

The Obligors are required by the terms of the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements to insure the villages against the
risk of material damage or destruction and resulting business interruption, acts of terrorism, public and product liabilities
and such other risks as a prudent owner and operator of similar properties would insure against.

The Obligors have granted security to the Borrower Security Trustee under the terms of the Borrower Deed of
Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge for amounts which are or may become payable under all of its insurance policies
relating to material damage or destruction and resulting business interruption taken out by the relevant Obligor in respect
of the relevant village.

A failure by any of the Obligors to renew the relevant insurance policies in respect of a village may, upon damage
to the village or loss of revenue in respect to the village (which would otherwise have been recoverable under such insurance
policy), result in a corresponding loss in the value of such village or payment recovery under the loan made to the relevant
Borrower. Similarly, even where the relevant insurance policy is current, there could be an administrative delay in the

43


-----

receipt of payment by the Obligors from the insurers which could affect the ability of the Obligors to meet their respective
payment obligations during that period of delay.

Certain types of risks and losses (such as losses resulting from epidemics and pandemics, including COVID-19,
war, terrorism, nuclear radiation, radioactive contamination and heaving or settling of structures) may be or become either
uninsurable or uneconomical to insure or may not be covered by the relevant insurance policies. Center Parcs’ insurance
policies do not compensate Center Parcs for revenue lost as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other risks might become
uninsurable (or uneconomical to insure) in the future. The occurrence of significant uninsured or uninsurable losses could
materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations, which could result in
the Obligors not having sufficient funds to repay in full amounts owing under or in respect of the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements.

**_Any adverse impact on guest perceptions of Center Parcs Holding B.V. or Center Parcs Europe N.V., with_**
**_whom Center Parcs shares its brand, could adversely affect Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

The successor to the founder of the Center Parcs brand is Center Parcs Holding B.V., a subsidiary of French listed
company Pierre & Vacances, which operates a holiday business in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Under
the terms of a brand sharing agreement relating to trademarks and marketing services with, among others, CP Opco, Center
Parcs Holding B.V. and Center Parcs Europe N.V. (“CP Continental Europe”), the parties agreed that CP Opco is
exclusively entitled to use the trademark registrations for the Center Parcs brand that it owns in its territory (UK, the
Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland) and CP Continental Europe is exclusively entitled to use the trademark
registrations for the Center Parcs brand that it owns in its territory (Albania, Austria, the Benelux, Belarus, BosniaHerzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland,
Israel, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Macedonia, Monaco, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovak
Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine). Under the brand sharing agreement, each party has
exclusive rights to operate holiday centres in its respective territory using its registered marks.

Any event or circumstance that has an adverse impact on guest perceptions of the Center Parcs brand and holiday
business outside the UK could have a material adverse effect on the reputation of the Center Parcs brand in the UK.

**_Center Parcs’ future performance depends on continued maintenance capital expenditure and investment_**
**_capital expenditure, which may be significant. Any failure to make the requisite maintenance capital expenditure or_**
**_investment capital expenditure in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,_**
**_financial condition and results of operations._**

Center Parcs’ future performance depends on making continued maintenance capital expenditure and investment
capital expenditure, which may be significant. A principal competitive factor for a holiday village is the uniqueness and
perceived quality of its accommodation, amenities and facilities. Accordingly, the regular addition of new or improved
accommodation, amenities and facilities and the repair or maintenance of those in existence are key to the continued
competitiveness of Center Parcs’ holiday villages.

Maintenance capital expenditures include refurbishments to existing facilities, including ensuring health and
safety standards are met. Although the Obligors are required under the terms of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement to spend a minimum of £18.5 million per year on maintenance capital expenditure, there can be no assurance
that this amount will be sufficient for Center Parcs’ requirements. Center Parcs’ maintenance capital expenditure for the
52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020 was approximately £27.1 million and
£27.5 million, respectively.

Investment capital expenditures include building new accommodation, upgrading existing accommodation and
adding, upgrading or expanding cafes, restaurants and other facilities. Center Parcs’ investment capital expenditure for the
52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020, was approximately £39.1 million and
£25.3 million, respectively. During the period of closure of its villages due to COVID-19, Center Parcs curtailed nonessential investment capital expenditures. Center Parcs also expects its investment capital expenditure to be materially
lower during the 2021 financial year compared to the 2019 and 2020 financial years. While Center Parcs expects to continue
its investment capital expenditures over the next several years, the development and construction of such projects not
currently under construction is subject to additional risks due to COVID-19 or otherwise, including construction delays as
a result of business activity restrictions and supply chain interruptions. As a result, Center Parcs’ current development plans
may not be completed as planned, which may impact future growth.

Center Parcs is continuing its refurbishment cycle, and 1,943 lodges have already been upgraded in the current
refurbishment cycle. Center Parcs upgraded 436 lodges in financial year 2019, 404 lodges in financial year 2020 and 92
lodges in financial year 2021 as at the date of this Offering Memorandum.

44


-----

Construction of three treehouses at Woburn Forest was completed in summer 2018, and 33 lodges at Whinfell
Forest were completed in spring 2019. Additionally, Center Parcs completed the construction of two new lodges at Woburn
Forest and four new treehouses at Whinfell Forest in summer 2020.

Historical and future investment capital expenditure may not yield the anticipated revenue or ADR growth or
improve the attractiveness of Center Parcs’ holiday villages. Even if revenues do increase, the additional revenues may not
be sufficient to recover the amounts invested by Center Parcs and to provide a return on such investments. In addition, if
Center Parcs does not have sufficient liquidity to finance these upgrades or if insufficient amounts are spent on capital
expenditure on the villages, Center Parcs’ villages may not remain competitive.

There could be a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations
if it fails to maintain the planned approach to its maintenance and investment cycle and/or if any investment that does not
result in revenue growth does not otherwise recover the amount invested or does not maintain the long-term attractiveness
or good and safe condition of the relevant holiday village. Moreover, delays in the addition of new or improved
accommodation, amenities and facilities or the closure of any of its amenities and facilities for repairs could adversely
affect occupancy levels and Center Parcs’ ability to realise revenue growth, which could have a material adverse effect on
its business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Failure to keep pace with developments in technology or any problems with maintaining or implementing_**
**_upgrades to Center Parcs’ IT systems could impair Center Parcs’ operations or competitive position._**

The holiday centre industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems, including those
systems and technologies used for Center Parcs’ bookings, revenue management and property management platforms.
These technologies and systems must be refined, updated and/or replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis.
If Center Parcs is unable to do so as quickly as its competitors, within budget cost and time frames or at all, its business
could suffer. Center Parcs is in the process of making updates to existing systems and introducing new IT systems and
technologies aimed at improving pricing for bookings, targeting new and repeat customers, strengthening and integrating
customer relationship management processes. Any problems with transitioning to or integrating its new systems could
adversely affect Center Parcs’ business. In particular, the implementation of the new IT systems could take longer than
expected, disrupt Center Parcs’ current systems and/or result in cost overruns. Center Parcs also may not achieve the
benefits that it anticipates from these systems or any other new technology or system in the future. If any of these risks
were to be realised, this could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial conditions and results of
operations.

**_Center Parcs may not be able to successfully develop new villages and it may not realise desired returns from_**
**_new villages or other villages it may acquire._**

From time to time, Center Parcs evaluates suitable locations for new villages to develop or acquire and is currently
negotiating an option agreement for a potential sixth site in the UK. Center Parcs may not be able to successfully identify
and secure such locations or may not be able to successfully execute opening such villages.

New villages may fail to become operational on a timely basis or at all due to setbacks including but not limited
to delays or failure to receive planning permissions or other consents, inability to meet development requests from local
authorities, infrastructure issues, construction delays, inadequate or delayed financing, the delay or inability to recruit or
manage appropriately skilled employees or the inability to identify or secure agreements with key suppliers or development
partners. Furthermore, once opened, new villages may not attract anticipated volumes of guests, either in the short or
long term, as a result of social distancing guidelines, reduced customer demand, differing customer expectations and
preferences in these new locations or due to other factors.

The integration of a new village is a complex and time-consuming process. Center Parcs may not be able to
integrate effectively any village it develops or acquires or successfully implement appropriate operational, financial and
management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from such developments or acquisitions.
Center Parcs may also be subject to unexpected claims and liabilities arising from such developments or acquisitions. These
claims and liabilities could be costly to defend, could be material to its financial position and might exceed either the
limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of the indemnifying parties. The
diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of the
businesses Center Parcs develops or acquires could negatively impact its business and results of operations. Further, the
benefits that it anticipates from these new developments or acquisitions may not be realised.

Any expansion into a new country would result in Center Parcs being subject to the laws and regulations of that
country, including taxation. As a result, Center Parcs’ risk exposure to political and regulatory changes will increase as a
result of opening a village in another country. The impact of, and costs associated with, complying with changes in
interpretation of existing, or the adoption of new, legislation, regulations or other laws or licensing and authorisation
regimes in the jurisdictions in which Center Parcs has plans to operate can be difficult to anticipate or estimate and could

45


-----

have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations. Expansion into a
new country could also subject Center Parcs to risks related to adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Further,
the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement permits management to only devote up to 25% of its time towards any
additional villages located outside the United Kingdom, including Longford Forest in the Republic of Ireland, and does not
require any additional Center Parcs villages that may be developed outside the United Kingdom to accede to the Obligor
Group (as is the case for any additional villages in the United Kingdom).

Additionally, if Center Parcs wishes to use the Center Parcs brand for a village located outside of the
United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland, it must invite CP Continental Europe to participate in
all aspects of the development, funding, ownership and future management of such village. If CP Continental Europe
accepts the invitation, Center Parcs and CP Continental Europe would have to participate in the development and
management of the village on terms identical to each other. As a result, Center Parcs may not be able to effectively integrate
such village into its existing business structure, which may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,
financial condition and results of operations.

The occurrence of any of these factors could negatively impact the ability of Center Parcs to generate the desired
returns from its strategy of international expansion, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Noteholders will not have recourse to any additional village outside the United Kingdom, its assets,_**
**_revenues or cash flow. Development of any such village may divert management’s time from villages in the United_**
**_Kingdom._**

The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement permits management to devote up to 25% of its time towards
any additional villages located outside the United Kingdom, including Longford Forest in the Republic of Ireland, and
does not permit any additional Center Parcs villages that may be developed outside the United Kingdom to accede to the
Obligor Group (as is the case for any additional villages in the United Kingdom).

Longford Forest, which opened in 2019, is Center Parcs’ first village outside of the United Kingdom. Subject
to the terms of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, Center Parcs’ management is permitted to provide a
number of services to help develop and operate Longford Forest. These services include the provision of development
services such as running tender processes for contractors and using reasonable endeavours to obtain required licenses and
consents as well as operating services such as recruitment services, employee training, incorporating Longford Forest in
to the sales and marketing activity undertaken by the Center Parcs Group, the provision of customer services such as
handling general guest queries via call centre and e-mail, the provision of a reservations system and the taking of
bookings, pricing and budget setting, health & safety advice, compliance and legal support, financial reporting and IT
support together with a range of other corporate support services. Although the Longford Management Services
Agreement provides that Center Parcs will be compensated for management’s time spent on Longford Forest, these
arrangements may not sufficiently compensate Center Parcs for the cost of providing such services and may divert
management's time from the management of villages in the United Kingdom, subject to the 25% limit described above.

Under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, none of the Obligors will own assets relating to, or
derive revenues from, Longford Forest or any other additional villages outside the United Kingdom. Noteholders will not
have recourse to any such village outside the United Kingdom, its assets, revenues or cash flow. In addition, the
development of additional villages outside the United Kingdom could divert management’s time from the five existing
villages or from any additional villages in the United Kingdom and may impose additional burdens on Center Parcs’
limited management resources. This could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ financial condition, results of
operations and business.

**_Center Parcs’ business could be harmed if it loses the services of its key management personnel or is unable_**
**_to attract and retain qualified employees._**

Center Parcs’ business depends upon the efforts and dedication of its senior management team and its staff,
both in the villages and at its head office. Competition for highly-qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of the
services of any of these key personnel without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel
could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
its success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees to keep pace with its needs. If Center
Parcs is unable to do so, its results of operations may be adversely affected.

From 27 March 2020 to 3 July 2020, Center Parcs furloughed approximately 90% of its employees pursuant to
the UK government’s CJRS. Following the reopening of Center Parcs’ villages on 24 July 2020, approximately 18% of
Center Parcs’ employees remained furloughed pursuant to the CJRS, which decreased to less than 1% as of
4 September 2020. There can be no assurance that all employees will return following the end of their furlough period or

46


-----

the expiry of the CJRS or that employees who do return will remain at Center Parcs in the short-to-medium term if
Center Parcs’ villages are required to close or if Center Parcs’ business otherwise deteriorates. To the extent that any
employees do not return or employees face unanticipated challenges when they do return, there may be an adverse impact
on employee morale and Center Parcs’ ability to operate effectively and attract and retain qualified employees.

In addition, Center Parcs’ future business success depends in part on its ability to continue to recruit, train,
motivate and retain employees and on its ability to continue to employ creative employees and consultants. The loss of
service of any key personnel, or an inability to attract and retain qualified employees and consultants, could have a
material adverse impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs depends on third party suppliers and contractors._**

Center Parcs has key contractual relationships with a number of third parties, including suppliers, insurers,
partners, banks and payment processors. In particular, Center Parcs relies on key suppliers to carry on its operations.
These include the Big Table Group Limited (formerly known as the Casual Dining Group) (“The Big Table”), whose
offering includes Café Rouge, Las Iguanas and Bella Italia, and the Nuance Group, Center Parcs’ retail partner. The
Center Parcs business model incorporates a range of service relationships, with some food and beverage and retail
offerings operated on a concession basis, others, such as Starbucks, being licensed to Center Parcs and some “back-ofhouse” services provided by third parties, including laundry services and food and beverage supplies. Center Parcs also
relies on third party service providers and IT systems such as payment processing services, ATCORE (formerly Anite), a
non-affiliated third-party company, which provides TourRes, the booking system used by Center Parcs, ESP, which
provides the booking system Elite for on-parc activities and restaurants and Adobe which provides the platform for
certain of Center Parcs’ websites.

The failure of one or more of the third-party suppliers and contractors to deliver or provide the services when
needed by Center Parcs or at the desired quality may have an adverse impact on Center Parcs’ operations and business. In
particular, certain of Center Parcs’ suppliers, including The Big Table and Nuance Group, have been severely impacted
by the COVID-19 crisis. Center Parcs is closely monitoring its suppliers’ ongoing operations but cannot assure that its
suppliers will be able to fulfil their obligations in the future. The failure of one or more of these third parties to fulfil its
obligations to Center Parcs for any other reason, or the termination of such agreements by any of the third-party suppliers
or contractors, may also cause significant disruption and have a material adverse effect on its result of operations,
financial performance and prospects. From time to time, Center Parcs may terminate (by agreement or otherwise) the
concessionaire agreements in relation to all or some of the units operated by its concessionaire partners. Where such
agreements are terminated, Center Parcs will seek to re-utilise this space for the provision of alternative goods and
services to be provided either by Center Parcs or other third parties. There can be no certainty that any alternative use
can be found or that any alternative will generate commercial returns as favourable as those previously enjoyed.

Furthermore, third party suppliers may seek to increase prices for their services. If Center Parcs is unable to
negotiate limits to any price increases or find alternative third-party suppliers providing services at lower prices, such
increases may negatively impact Center Parcs’ business. In addition, material disputes may arise between Center Parcs
and third-party service providers and suppliers, which could adversely affect the relationship between Center Parcs and
such third parties. Any or all such developments could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_The operation and development of Center Parcs’ holiday villages are subject to planning and other_**
**_consents, laws and regulations, which may constrain future development or new facilities and amenities. In addition,_**
**_changes in use or planning consents relating to property neighbouring the villages may have a material detrimental_**
**_effect on guests’ enjoyment of the villages._**

Center Parcs’ villages are required to be constructed in accordance with the relevant planning permission to
ensure that the current use of the holiday villages is lawful. If the construction or use of a holiday village is not in
accordance with the relevant planning permission, the relevant council may, in certain circumstances, require that use to
cease. Further, a council can require compliance with the conditions of any planning permission or planning agreement,
or, in certain circumstances, the alteration or reinstatement of any construction carried out without planning permission.

All of Center Parcs’ villages are in rural locations. Center Parcs may experience material difficulties or
failures in maintaining or renewing the necessary licences or approvals for its holiday villages, which could result in
holiday village or attraction closures or fines. Stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to
zoning, land use and environmental factors could also delay or prevent development of new holiday villages in particular
locations. In the future, obtaining planning permission for future developments or new facilities and amenities may be
difficult. In addition, if any such planning permissions cannot be obtained, there are limited alternative uses for rural sites
of the size of the villages where base land values are low and alternative planning permissions are unlikely.

47


-----

The operation, development and redevelopment of recreational facilities and other structures at Center Parcs’
holiday villages and the development of new or additional villages may require consent from the relevant local planning
authorities as well as from third parties, such as landlords, development partners, finance providers and regulatory
bodies. Center Parcs may not be able to obtain the requisite planning or other consents as and when required in respect of
developments or redevelopments or the roll-out of new or additional holiday villages, and planning or other consents may
be withdrawn in relation to existing offerings at any of its holiday villages. In addition, Center Parcs’ properties may be
subject to certain restrictive covenants in favour of third parties.

Center Parcs constructed 90 new units of accommodation in financial year 2019, 12 new units of
accommodation in financial year 2020 and six new units of accommodation in financial year 2021 as at the date of this
Offering Memorandum. Center Parcs has planning permission for all of these new builds. From time to time, Center
Parcs plans to build additional new units of accommodation, subject to planning permission and other factors. If Center
Parcs is unable to obtain the requisite planning permissions for these additional lodges at the existing villages, it would
be unable to construct these additional lodges, which would have an adverse effect on Center Parcs’ expansion plans for
these sites.

Center Parcs works with and engages its local planning authorities with regard to issues of shared concern that
impact the development and redevelopment of its properties and the roll-out of new holiday villages, including
sensitivities to site noise, listed structures, road congestion and other traffic issues, and health and safety issues. If it were
to fail to cooperate with local planning authorities or if Center Parcs’ work relationship with such authorities were to be
adversely affected for any reason, this could negatively impact its ability to obtain the planning and other consents
necessary for the development and redevelopment of current villages or expanding into new villages, or it could result in
the withdrawal of existing consents. Additionally, possible changes to planning rules (such as the categorisation of flood
zones), or by-law distances which prohibit development within a certain distance of flood defence structures) would, if
made, adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to develop a holiday village. Additional constraints on future development
could have an adverse effect on guest numbers, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.

Any refusal to grant, or delay in granting Center Parcs’ requested planning or other consents, or the
application of any special conditions to such consents (or breach by Center Parcs of such conditions), could have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, future planning
consents are likely to impose further conditions and/or require Center Parcs to enter into new planning agreements. In
addition, proposed regeneration schemes may adversely impact guest access to, or the operation of, individual facilities.
The constraints placed on Center Parcs’ operations by future planning consents or regeneration schemes may be more
onerous than those that currently apply, and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Changes in use or planning consents relating to property neighbouring the villages may have a material
detrimental effect on guests’ enjoyment of the villages. For example, changes in use or planning consents could permit
owners or occupiers of property adjoining or close to Center Parcs’ villages to use their property in a way that disturbs or
diminishes guests’ enjoyment of the villages or the natural setting in which the villages are located. These uses would
include the installation or use of plant and equipment (e.g. electricity pylons) or activities that emit noise or smell, or that
are inconsistent with guests’ enjoyment of a holiday in a natural environment. Any such detrimental change, or negative
publicity regarding such a change, may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Center Parcs may be subject to liabilities and costs associated with its intellectual property._**

Center Parcs relies on trademarks to protect its brand. Many of these trademarks have been a key part of
establishing its business in the UK holiday market, including Center Parcs and Aqua Sana. Center Parcs believes these
trademarks have significant value and are important to the marketing of its villages. The steps Center Parcs has taken or
will take to protect its proprietary trademark rights may not provide adequate protection, and Center Parcs may not have
adequate resources to enforce its trademarks if third parties infringe its trademarks. In addition, although Center Parcs
owns its trademarks, these trademarks may infringe the proprietary rights of others and may not be upheld if challenged.
If its trademarks infringe the rights of others, Center Parcs may be prevented from using its trademarks, any of which
occurrences could harm its business. In any such event, Center Parcs could be forced to rebrand its products and services,
which could result in loss of brand recognition and may require Center Parcs to devote significant resources to
advertising and marketing new brands. Further, any claims of trademark infringement may require Center Parcs to enter
into a royalty or licensing agreement to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property, which may not be
available on terms acceptable to Center Parcs.

From time to time, Center Parcs enters into agreements with third parties that permit it to use the intellectual
property of such third parties at its holiday villages. The third parties owning such intellectual property may not renew

48


-----

such agreements with Center Parcs or may increase the cost for it to use such intellectual property to levels that make it
cost prohibitive or economically unfavourable for it to continue such arrangements.

**_Potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect Center Parcs’ business._**

From time to time, Center Parcs may become involved in litigation and regulatory actions as part of its
ordinary course of business. There is no guarantee that it will be successful in defending against civil suits or regulatory
actions, such as matters related to public and employee safety, food safety, employment and environmental laws and
regulations.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of an increase in legal claims from employees and
guests related to potential or alleged COVID-19 exposure at Center Parcs’ villages, including as a result of a localised
outbreak at any of the villages. There is limited precedent for such claims in the context of a major pandemic and Center
Parcs cannot predict how such claims would be resolved by the courts. Further, such claims could be time-consuming
and divert management time and resources away from operation of the Center Parcs’ villages.

Even if a civil litigation claim or regulatory investigation or claim is meritless, does not prevail or is not
pursued, any negative publicity surrounding assertions against Center Parcs’ holiday villages could adversely affect its
reputation. Regardless of their outcome, litigation and regulatory actions may result in substantial costs and expenses and
divert the attention of Center Parcs’ management. In addition to pending matters, future litigation, government
proceedings, labour disputes or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of Center Parcs’
normal business operations, which may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and
results of operations. See “Business – Legal Proceedings”.

**_Center Parcs is subject to privacy and data protection laws and any data breach or change in legislation_**
**_could adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to market its products effectively._**

In the ordinary course of business, Center Parcs collects, transmits and stores guest and employee data,
including highly sensitive personally identifiable information, in information systems that it maintains. Center Parcs has
a large guest database made up of prospective, current and former guests. This data could be a target for cyber-attack.
While the protection of such guest and employee data is critical to Center Parcs and Center Parcs takes steps to protect
such data, any such attack could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Furthermore, Center Parcs’ use of this information is subject to numerous laws, regulations and standards
designed to protect sensitive or confidential client and employee data. The new EU-wide General Data Protection
Regulation (the “GDPR”) became applicable on 25 May 2018, and has been substantively implemented into UK law by
the Data Protection Act 2018, which replaces the UK Data Protection Act 1998. The Data Protection Act 2018
implements more stringent operational requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for
example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used. Regulators now have the ability to impose
larger fines of up to the greater of £17 million (€20 million) or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the
preceding financial year.

Center Parcs seeks to ensure that procedures are in place to ensure compliance with the relevant data
protection regulations by its employees and any third-party service providers. Notwithstanding such efforts, Center Parcs
is exposed to the risk that employee or guest data could be wrongfully appropriated, lost, disclosed, stolen or processed in
breach of data protection regulations. For example, Center Parcs recently experienced a breach of employee personal
data. The breach was detected promptly and notified to the regulator, which did not undertake enforcement action, and
related legal claims by employees were covered by insurance. If Center Parcs, or any of the third-party service providers
on which it relies, fail to store or transmit guest or employee information and online payment details in a secure manner,
or if any loss of personal customer data were otherwise to occur, Center Parcs could face liability under data protection
laws and be subject to legal claims by affected individuals.

Center Parcs’ holiday villages rely on its guest database and a variety of direct marketing techniques,
including email marketing. Any expansion of existing, and/or implementation of new, laws and regulations regarding
marketing, solicitation, privacy or data protection could adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to utilise its guest database
for email and other marketing techniques and could result in changes to its marketing strategy. If this occurs, Center
Parcs may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could materially adversely impact its
guest numbers and revenues.

**_Center Parcs may be adversely affected by environmental requirements and liabilities._**

Center Parcs is subject to extensive and frequently changing national and local environmental laws and
regulations, including laws and regulations governing air and noise emissions; water use and wastewater and stormwater

49


-----

discharges; the maintenance of above-ground and underground storage tanks; the use, release, storage, disposal, handling
and transportation of, and exposure to, oil, chemicals and hazardous substances; energy usage and emissions; the
management and disposal of waste; and otherwise relating to health and safety and the protection of the environment,
natural resources and the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater. The development and operation of Center
Parcs’ facilities require various permits and licences pursuant to environmental laws and regulations, which can result in
challenges in the applications process, constraints in on-site operations, and costs in compliance.

Violations of environmental laws and regulations can lead to significant fines and penalties and requirements
for rectification, which could require expenditure, changes in site operations or temporary closures of all or part of the
relevant holiday centre. Such laws and regulations can impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to
whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of contaminants. Historical land uses on parts of the village sites, such
as quarrying, timber treatment, an electrical substation, sewage discharge/treatment, and a small part of the Whinfell
Forest site that is a registered landfill (which is now closed, but is relatively close to an off-site potable water abstraction
point), may have introduced pollution or contamination into the soil and/or groundwater in parts of the Center Parcs
village sites or may have migrated beyond the boundaries of these sites. Sanctions for alleged or actual non-compliance
with environmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and
results of operations. Center Parcs is also subject to certain contractual requirements relating to the environment and may
incur liabilities arising from historical, existing and future environmental contamination at properties it owns or operates
now or in the future or has owned or operated in the past. The presence of hazardous substances on a property or the
failure to meet environmental regulatory requirements may cause Center Parcs to incur substantial remediation or
compliance costs or temporarily close the relevant holiday centre. In addition, if hazardous substances are located on or
released from any of its properties, Center Parcs could incur substantial liabilities through a private party personal injury
claim, a claim by an adjacent property owner for property damage or a claim by a governmental entity for other damages,
such as natural resource damages. Center Parcs is also required to purchase carbon allowances annually commensurate
with energy consumption (with allowance prices increasing each year), and to audit energy use, both of which are subject
to financial penalties for non-compliance.

Center Parcs may incur additional expenditure and other commercial and financial impacts to comply with
existing as well as new or revised environmental legislation and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and
regulations or more rigorous enforcement of such laws and regulations, as well as in connection with fulfilling
contractual obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and
results of operations. A conviction for an environmental offence could also negatively affect Center Parcs’ ability to
contract with certain third parties in the future.

If an environmental liability arises in relation to any of the holiday villages and it is not remedied, or is not
capable of being remedied, this may adversely affect Center Parcs’ business or financial condition. This may be either
because of cost or value implications for Center Parcs and its properties or because of disruption to services provided at
the relevant holiday village.

**_Center Parcs’ existing leases are subject to early termination risks and Center Parcs may be unable to_**
**_renew headleases or obtain new leases on acceptable terms._**

The headleases for Elveden Forest and Sherwood Forest expire in 2999, the headleases for Longleat Forest
expire in 2073, the headleases for Whinfell Forest expire in 2120 and the headlease for Woburn Forest expires in 2109.
There is a risk that the landlord of the relevant property may terminate the headlease (and in the case of Longleat Forest,
the superior landlord may forfeit the superior leases causing the two headleases to terminate) before the expiry of the
contractual term for failure to pay rent or other breach of tenant obligation.

The rent payable under each of the headleases for Whinfell Forest, Elveden Forest and Sherwood Forest is a
nominal sum. The yearly rent payable under the headleases for Longleat Forest is currently £936,637 in aggregate subject
to upwards-only review every five years by reference to the historic increase in revenue at Longleat Forest. The most
recent rent review for Longleat Forest was settled in January 2020 and the next review is scheduled for 2025. The rent
payable under the Woburn Forest lease is currently £641,412 per annum payable since March 2018 and subject to
upwards only review every five years by reference to the greater of an increase in rent in line with the retail price index, a
fixed percentage increase in the passing rent or the historic increase in revenue at Woburn Forest. Other tenant
obligations in the headleases include, but are not limited to, an obligation to keep the properties in good and substantial
repair. A failure to pay rent, including as a result of any rent increases, or other breach of tenant obligation may result in
an early termination of the relevant lease. Any early termination, delay in or inability to renew Center Parcs’ existing
leases may negatively impact its ability to operate its villages. Each Obligor has undertaken in the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements to pay, when due, all sums payable by it under each headlease, to perform and observe all of its material
covenants under each headlease and not to commit a material breach of any headlease.

50


-----

The headleases for Whinfell Forest and Longleat Forest do not contain mortgagee protection provisions in the
event of forfeiture. The Woburn Forest headlease does contain mortgagee protection provisions and therefore, before the
landlord can forfeit the headlease, it is obliged to notify the mortgagee of its intention to do so, giving the mortgagee,
within a period of three months, the opportunity to i) enter into a deed of covenant with the landlord to comply with the
tenant obligations in the lease or ii) procure an assignment of the lease to a third party in accordance with the terms of the
headlease. If a landlord were to seek to forfeit a headlease, the Obligor owning the property and the Borrower Security
Trustee would have a right to apply to the English courts to seek relief from forfeiture. The headleases for Elveden Forest
and Sherwood Forest contain a proviso in the forfeiture clause that in the event of the landlord serving notice on the
tenant alleging breach of any material covenant by the tenant, the landlord must contemporaneously serve a copy of the
notice on any mortgagee of which the landlord has notice and the landlord must give not less than ten days’ prior notice
to any mortgagee to exercise any right of re-entry.

**_Any property on which the villages are located may be subject to compulsory purchase._**

Any property in the United Kingdom may at any time be compulsorily acquired by a public authority
possessing compulsory purchase powers (for instance, local authorities and statutory undertakings (including electricity,
gas, water and railway undertakers) in respect of their statutory functions) if it can demonstrate that the acquisition is
required. Where any land is acquired through compulsory purchase, compensation would be payable to Center Parcs as a
result. However, any such compensation may not reflect the value to Center Parcs of the affected land.

Any promoter of a compulsory purchaser order would need to demonstrate that compulsory purchase was
necessary or desirable for the promoter’s statutory functions and for, or in, the public interest. As a general rule, in the
event of an order being made in respect of all or any part of any holiday village, compensation would normally be
payable on the basis that it be broadly equivalent to the open market value of all owners’ and tenants’ proprietary
interests in the portion of the village subject to compulsory purchase at the time of the related purchase, so far as those
interests are included in the order. Compensation would normally be payable in respect of the land acquired and the
diminution in value of any retained land, reduction in rent and other adverse impacts of the compulsory purchase scheme.

There is often a delay between the compulsory purchase of a property and the payment of compensation,
although advance payment of compensation is available representing 90% of the amount of compensation which the
acquiring authority considers is due (where the acquiring authority takes possession before compensation has been
agreed).

Compulsory purchase of all or any significant portion of property relating to the villages, or the payment of
compensation that does not reflect the value to Center Parcs of affected land, may have a material adverse effect on
Center Parcs’ financial condition and results of operations.

**_Work stoppages, increased staff costs, and other employee problems could negatively impact Center Parcs’_**
**_future profits._**

A lengthy strike or other work stoppage at one of the holiday villages could have an adverse effect on Center
Parcs’ business and results of operations. Center Parcs’ employees are not unionised, but some of Center Parcs’
employees are, or may in the future be, represented by works councils. Center Parcs may experience union activity in the
future which could negatively impact Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, staff costs are a primary cost component in operating Center Parcs. Increased staff costs, due to
competition for available workers, increased minimum wage or employee benefit costs, changes in labour laws or
otherwise, could adversely impact Center Parcs’ operating expenses. For example, costs of medical benefits may increase
significantly due to regulations, macroeconomic conditions and other factors beyond Center Parcs’ control.

**_Acts of terrorism may negatively impact Center Parcs’ business._**

Terrorist attacks have created many economic and political uncertainties. Center Parcs cannot predict the
extent to which terrorism or security alerts may directly or indirectly impact demand for its holiday parks, or otherwise
impact its business and operating results. The occurrence of any such terrorist event near or at a village could have a
material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE FINANCING STRUCTURE**

**_The Obligors’ ability to meet their obligations in respect of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will depend_**
**_primarily on the performance of their businesses and Center Parcs may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows_**
**_to meet such obligations_**

The Obligors’ ability to meet their scheduled payment obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement will depend upon the financial condition and performance of the Center Parcs business as a whole and their
general financial condition and operating performance, which in turn will be affected by general economic conditions and
by financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond their control. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has
_negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of_
_operations.” The obligations of the Obligors to make payments under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement are_
in each case full-recourse obligations and are not limited. Future performance of Center Parcs’ business may not be
similar to the performance results of operations of the business to date described in this Offering Memorandum.

Unless previously repaid in full, the Borrowers will be required to repay (i) the Class A2 Loan, the Class A4
Loan, and the Class A5 Loan on the Class A2 Loan Final Maturity Date (in respect of the Class A2 Loan), the Class A4
Loan Final Maturity Date (in respect of the Class A4 Loan), and the Class A5 Loan Maturity Date (in respect of the Class
A5 Loan), respectively and (ii) the Class B Loans on the Class B3 Loan Final Maturity Date (in respect of the Class B3
Loan), the Class B4 Loan Final Maturity Date (in respect of the Class B4 Loan), and the Class B5 Loan Final Maturity
Date (in respect of the Class B5 Loan) (together with the Class A2 Loan Final Maturity Date, the Class A4 Loan Final
Maturity Date, the Class A5 Loan Final Maturity Date, the Class B3 Loan Maturity Date and the Class B4 Loan Maturity
Date, the “Loan Repayment Dates”).

The ability of the Issuer to redeem the Class B3 Notes on the Class B3 Note Expected Maturity Date, the Class
B4 Notes on the Class B4 Note Expected Maturity Date, and the Class B5 Notes on the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity
Date is dependent on the repayment in full of the corresponding Class B3 Loan, Class B4 Loan or Class B5 Loan, as
applicable, by the Borrowers. Center Parcs cannot assure holders that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from
operations or that future sources of capital will be available to it in an amount sufficient to enable the Obligors to service
their indebtedness, including the Class B3 Loan, Class B4 Loan, and the Class B5 Loan, or to fund their other liquidity
needs.

Further, a failure to repay the Class B3 Loan on the Class B3 Loan Expected Maturity Date, the Class B4 Loan
on the Class B4 Loan Expected Maturity Date and/or the Class B5 Loan on the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date
will not constitute an event of default but, while the Class A Loans are outstanding, will only give rise to a Share
Enforcement Event.

**_Center Parcs has significant leverage which could adversely affect its financial condition and its ability to service its_**
**_payment obligations under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements and therefore the ability of the Issuer to service its_**
**_payment obligations under the Notes including the Offered Notes._**

Center Parcs has consolidated indebtedness that is substantial in relation to its shareholders’ equity. After
giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, Center Parcs’ pro forma total debt as at the Sixth Closing Date amounts to
approximately £1.92 billion. In addition, Center Parcs (and the Issuer) may incur further indebtedness under, or permitted
by, the terms and conditions of the Class A Notes (the “Class A Conditions”), the terms and conditions of the Class B
Notes (the “Class B Conditions”) and the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements. Center Parcs’ relatively high level of debt
could:

        - make it more difficult for Center Parcs to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements and ultimately for the Issuer to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Notes;

        - increase Center Parcs’ vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including rises
in interest rates;

         - restrict Center Parcs from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

         - along with the financial and other restrictive covenants under Center Parcs’ indebtedness, limit its ability
to obtain additional financing, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends other than as permitted in
accordance with the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements;

        - require Center Parcs to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to service its
indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund future working capital, capital
expenditures, other general corporate requirements and dividends;

52


-----

         - require Center Parcs to sell or otherwise transfer assets used in its business in order to fund its debt
service obligations;

         - limit Center Parcs’ flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in
which it operates;

         - place Center Parcs at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt; and

         - increase its cost of borrowing.

Any failure to pay amounts due and payable under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements could give rise to an
event of default or a Share Enforcement Event (in the case of the Class B Loans) and the Borrower Security Trustee may,
in such circumstances, elect to declare all amounts outstanding under those agreements to be immediately due and
payable and initiate enforcement proceedings against the collateral provided by Center Parcs to secure its obligations
under such agreements.

The consequences of a Share Enforcement Event are that the Borrower Security Trustee will be entitled, by
notice, to enforce the Topco Share Security in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of the Class B
Noteholders. See “Risks relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency”.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ ability to
satisfy its debt obligations, including the Offered Notes.

**_Center Parcs’ head office is subject to a first ranking mortgage which will not form part of the security package_**
**_granted pursuant to the Transaction, and if enforced could result in Center Parcs losing the use of its head office._**

Pursuant to a term loan facility agreement dated 8 November 2005 made between CP Opco and The Royal
Bank of Scotland plc (the “Head Office Loan”), Center Parcs Limited granted a fixed charge dated 8 November 2005
over all of its legal interests in the head office (the “Head Office Mortgage”), with a maturity date in 2020. As at
23 April 2020, £0.1 million remained outstanding under the Head Office Loan. The Head Office Mortgage does not form
part of the security package granted pursuant to the Transactions. If CP Opco fails to meet its repayment obligations
under the Head Office Loan then the Head Office Mortgage could be enforced, resulting in the sale of the head office to a
third party. In addition, a failure to meet repayment obligations under the Head Office Loan could trigger a cross-default
and/or a share enforcement event, as applicable, under the Class A Loans and the Class B Loans. Center Parcs has in
place business interruption procedures to minimise the impact of a loss of its head office; however, should such an event
occur there may be administrative and financial implications which will impact on the ability of Center Parcs to meet its
payment obligations under the Loans and ultimately for the Issuer to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Notes.

**_Restrictive covenants in the Transaction Documents governing the Class A Loans and the Class B Loans may_**
**_adversely affect the operations of Center Parcs._**

The Transaction Documents limit the Obligors’ ability, among other things, with respect to:

         - the incurrence or guarantee of additional indebtedness;

        - the payment of dividends or other distributions on, and the redemption or repurchase of, its equity;

        - the making of certain restricted payments and investments;

        - the incurrence of certain liens;

         - the imposition of restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends and other payments to
members of the Group;

         - the transfer, lease, sale or other disposition of certain assets;

         - the merger, consolidation with, or sale of substantially all of the Group’s assets to, other entities;

         - the entry into certain transactions with affiliates;

        - the entry into sale and leaseback transactions; and

         - the impairment of the security interest for the noteholders.

In addition, the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement includes other more restrictive covenants and may
restrict the Obligors’ ability to prepay their other indebtedness, including the Class B Loans, while indebtedness under

53


-----

the Class A Loans remain outstanding. The ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond the
Borrowers’ control.

The restrictions contained in the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements could:

        - limit the Obligors’ ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise
restrict their respective activities or business plans; and

        - adversely affect the ability to finance the Obligors’ operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or
alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in Center Parcs’
interest.

A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the minimum FCF DSCR
requirements in the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements could result in a default or (in the case of the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) a Share Enforcement Event.

**_Loan Events of Default may occur without the knowledge of the Borrower Security Trustee if the Borrowers fail to_**
**_notify the Borrower Security Trustee of such event._**

The Borrower Deed of Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge provide that the Borrower Security Trustee
will be entitled to assume, unless it is otherwise disclosed in any investor report or compliance certificate or the Borrower
Security Trustee is expressly informed otherwise, that no Loan Event of Default or Potential Loan Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing. The Borrower Security Trustee will not itself monitor whether any such event has occurred.
As the Issuer is a special purpose company, it will fall to the Obligors themselves to make these determinations as well as
the determinations of the financial and operational positions underlying them, which may be subjective. The Borrower
Security Trustee shall not be obliged to make any such determinations and shall be able to conclusively rely on any
investor report or compliance certificate provided to it without being obliged to enquire as to the accuracy or validity of
any such investor report or compliance certificate.

**_The Class B5 Notes are contractually subordinated to the Class A Notes as to payment and rank junior to the Class A_**
**_Notes with respect to the application of enforcement proceeds, other than in respect of the Topco Security. As a result,_**
**_the Issuer may be unable to make payments on the Class B5 Notes when due._**

Pursuant to the applicable payment waterfall set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, payments to be made to
the holders of the Class B Notes in respect of principal and interest thereon will be contractually subordinated to
corresponding payments to be made to holders of the Class A Notes. Likewise, principal and interest payments to be
made on the Class B Loans will be contractually subordinated to payments to be made on or under the Class A Loans and
the Liquidity Facility, among other things. Furthermore, subject to certain limited exceptions, the Obligors will not be
permitted to make any payments, including interest payments, under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, and
consequently in respect of the Class B Notes, unless funded out of new equity or, (assuming that the extraordinary
resolution is approved by the Class A Noteholders under the Class A consent solicitation), on or prior to the Financial
Covenant Test Date occurring in February 2022 (for so long as a Waiver End Date Certificate has not been delivered) the
proceeds of a Class B Loan, provided that the aggregate amount of the proceeds of any Class B Loan that is applied to
pay interest in respect of the Class B Loans may not exceed £75 million, and consequently the Issuer may not be able to
make corresponding interest payments on the Class B5 Notes if the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is not
satisfied, including if the Class A FCF DSCR falls below 1.35x.

Furthermore, the Class B5 Notes rank junior to the Class A Notes, and debt outstanding under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement ranks junior to debt outstanding under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement
and the Liquidity Facility, among others, in each case in respect of the application of any amounts realised through the
enforcement of the security granted under the Issuer Security Documents and the Borrower Security Documents,
respectively. Accordingly, the proceeds of any enforcement of such security may not be sufficient to meet the Obligors’
payment obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or the Issuer’s payment obligations with respect
to the Class B5 Notes following the application of such proceeds towards the full repayment of Center Parcs’ prior
ranking debt described above. However, the Class B5 Notes benefit from the Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco
Security, which security will not be shared with the Class A Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements
_— Topco Payment Undertaking” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Topco Security Agreement.”_

In addition, for so long as the Class A Notes and the Class A Loans are outstanding, the holders of the Class
B5 Notes will not be able to declare a Class B Note Event of Default or a Class B Loan Event of Default.

See “— Risks Relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency,” “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements — Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement” and “Description of the Class B5 Loan” for further details._

**_Topco is a holding company and will depend upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the Topco_**
**_Payment Undertaking._**

Topco is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other than
investments its subsidiaries. Topco will depend upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries to meet its
obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking, pursuant to which Topco has undertaken to pay to the Borrower
Security Trustee all principal, interest and other amounts outstanding under the Class B Loans then outstanding in certain
circumstances, including in the event that the Class B5 Loan is not repaid in full on the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity
Date. If Topco’s subsidiaries do not, or are unable to, distribute cash to Topco in an amount sufficient to enable Topco to
meet its obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking, Topco will not have any other source of funds that would
allow it to make the necessary payments to the Borrower Security Trustee. Failure by Topco to make such payments will
give the right to the Borrower Security Trustee (on instruction from the Class B Note Trustee or, as the case may be, the
Class B Noteholders) to enforce the Topco Share Security over the shares Topco holds in CP Cayman Limited and the
share security granted to the Borrower Security Trustee by CP Cayman Limited over the shares it holds in Center Parcs
(Holdings 1) Limited. The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement
will also restrict the ability of Topco’s subsidiaries to move cash within the Group. Applicable law may also limit the
amounts that some of Topco’s subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests,
or even prevent such payments. Any such inability to transfer cash within the Group may mean that even though the
relevant entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to enable Topco to meet its obligations under the Topco
Payment Undertaking, they may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity to another in order to
make payments, directly or indirectly, to Topco. Accordingly, Center Parcs can provide no assurances that Topco will be
able meet its obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking should the need arise. In addition, the Topco Payment
Undertaking is limited in recourse to the Topco Secured Property and after enforcement of the Topco Security
Documents, Topco’s obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking will be deemed to be discharged in full. If
amounts outstanding under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement have not been paid in full following the
enforcement of the Topco Security, such amounts will remain outstanding and holders of the Class B3 Notes, the Class
B4 Notes, and the Class B5 Notes will not be entitled to call a Class B Loan Event of Default until the earlier of the day
on which all amounts outstanding under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement are paid in full or the Class B3
Note Final Maturity Date, the Class B4 Note Final Maturity Date, and the Class B5 Note Final Maturity Date, as
applicable.

**_Center Parcs may not be able to redeem: (i) the Class B3 Notes in full on the Class B3 Note Expected Maturity Date,_**
**_which falls 25 years earlier than the Class B3 Note Final Maturity Date; (ii) the Class B4 Notes in full on the Class_**
**_B4 Note Expected Maturity Date, which falls 23 years earlier than the Class B4 Note Final Maturity Date; or (iii) the_**
**_Class B5 Notes in full on the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date, which falls 24 years earlier than the Class B5_**
**_Note Final Maturity Date and thereafter, interest on the Class B3 Notes, the Class B4 Notes, and the Class B5 Notes,_**
**_as applicable, will be deferred._**

The Issuer’s ability to redeem the Class B3 Notes in full on the Class B3 Note Expected Maturity Date will
depend on the repayment in full of the Class B3 Loan by the Borrowers on the Class B3 Loan Expected Maturity Date.
The Issuer’s ability to redeem the Class B4 Notes in full on the Class B4 Note Expected Maturity Date will depend on
the repayment in full of the Class B4 Loan by the Borrowers on the Class B4 Loan Expected Maturity Date. The Issuer’s
ability to redeem the Class B5 Notes in full on the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date will depend on the repayment
in full of the Class B5 Loan by the Borrowers on the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date. This, in turn, will depend
on many factors beyond the Issuer’s or Center Parcs’ control, including general economic conditions and financial,
competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, together with the other risks described in this Offering
Memorandum. As a result, there can be no guarantee that Center Parcs will have sufficient funds available to repay: (i)
the Class B3 Loan on the Class B3 Loan Expected Maturity Date and consequently that the Issuer will have sufficient
funds to redeem the Class B3 Notes in full on the Class B3 Note Expected Maturity Date; (ii) the Class B4 Loan on the
Class B4 Loan Expected Maturity Date and consequently that the Issuer will have sufficient funds to redeem the Class
B4 Notes in full on the Class B4 Note Expected Maturity Date; or (iii) the Class B5 Loan on the Class B5 Loan Expected
Maturity Date and consequently that the Issuer will have sufficient funds to redeem the Class B5 Notes in full on the
Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date. The Class B3 Note Expected Maturity Date is on 28 August 2022, while the
Class B3 Note Final Maturity Date is on 28 February 2047. The Class B4 Note Expected Maturity Date is on 28 August
2025, while the Class B4 Note Final Maturity Date is on 28 February 2047. The Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date
is on 28 August 2026, while the Class B5 Note Final Maturity Date is on 28 August 2050.

Furthermore, the yield to maturity of the Class B3 Notes, the Class B4 Notes, and the Class B5 Notes will
depend on, among other things, the amount and timing of repayment and prepayment of principal on the Class B3 Loan,
the Class B4 Loan, or the Class B5 Loan, as applicable, and the price paid by the holders of the Class B3 Notes, the Class
B4 Notes, and the Class B5 Notes, as applicable. Such yield may be adversely affected by a higher or lower than
anticipated rate of prepayment on the Class B3 Loan, the Class B4 Loan, or the Class B5 Loan, as applicable. Timing for

55


-----

prepayment of the Class B3 Loan, the Class B4 Loan, or the Class B5 Loan cannot be predicted and will be influenced by
a wide variety of factors, as described above.

Accordingly, Center Parcs can provide no assurance with respect to timing of prepayments on the Class B3
Loan, the Class B4 Loan, or the Class B5 Loan or as to amounts to be prepaid and consequently the yield to maturity of
the Class B3 Notes, the Class B4 Notes, and the Class B5 Notes.

**_Sale of a Propco may have an adverse effect on the ability of the Borrowers to meet their obligations under the Loans_**
**_and ultimately affect the repayments on the Notes by the Issuer._**

Under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Obligors are permitted, subject to certain conditions,
to undertake sale and leaseback transactions in respect of one or more holiday parks. In each such case, provided that the
relevant conditions are satisfied, the Borrower Security Trustee will be required to give its consent to the disposal, to the
release of the property interest held by the relevant Propco, and (if the relevant Propco is also being disposed of at the
same time) to the release of the relevant Propco from its obligations, and from the security interests granted by it, under
the Transaction Documents.

Under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, these conditions include (but are not limited to) (a) the
requirement to prepay, pro rata, the then outstanding Class A Loans, together with any applicable premium payable at
that time in respect of a consequential redemption of the Class A Notes and (b) that the Class A Noteholders (voting as a
single class) have approved the entry into the relevant transaction in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Note Trust Deed. A further condition which must be met is that the Borrower Security Trustee is
satisfied (by virtue of a Rating Agency Confirmation or a Ratings Assessment) that the then ratings of the Class A Notes
will not be (i) downgraded (ii) withdrawn or (iii) publicly placed on review for possible downgrade, as a result of the
relevant sale and leaseback transaction. See “Description of Other Indebtedness — Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan
_Agreement” for a fuller description of the conditions which must be satisfied in order for the Obligors to be entitled to_
undertake sale and leaseback transactions in respect of the holiday parks. There are no restrictions under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement to undertake a sale and leaseback.

There is a risk that the potential benefits (in particular financial de-leveraging) of any sale and leaseback
transaction may not be fully realised as initially anticipated. In particular, there is a risk that rent increases (although
required to be capped at an average of 4% per annum) may become a financial burden for the Obligors which eventually
affects the Issuer’s ability to make payments of principal and interest under the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes.

Further, there is a risk that following a sale and leaseback of a Propco or a holiday park to a third party, such
lease might be terminated or forfeited by the relevant landlord with negative consequences for the Obligors. Risks might
arise such as the Obligors losing the use of a site and finding difficulty in locating a comparable replacement, loss of
income from the relevant holiday park and the introduction of competition to the remaining holiday parks secured in
favour of the Borrower Security Trustee through the development of the forfeited site as an alternative holiday
destination.

**_Challenges by secured creditors of the financing transactions described in this Offering Memorandum could have a_**
**_negative impact on other secured creditors._**

The financing transactions described in this Offering Memorandum have been structured based on English law
and practice as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum. It is possible that a secured creditor which is subject
to laws other than the laws of England and Wales may seek to challenge the validity and/or enforceability of one or more
features of the financing structure under the local laws of such creditor’s jurisdiction. Potential investors should be aware
that the outcome of any such challenge may depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to, the application
of the laws of a jurisdiction other than England and Wales. There can be no assurance that any challenge would not
adversely affect directly or indirectly the rights of the other secured creditors, including the holders of Class B5 Notes,
the market value of the Class B5 Notes and/or the ability of the Issuer to make interest and principal payments on the
Class B5 Notes.

**_Center Parcs is exposed to the creditworthiness of third party financial institutions._**

The creditworthiness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, derivative,
trading, clearing or other relationships among the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened
defaults by, one institution (or more) could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or
defaults by other institutions. This may adversely affect the financial institutions, such as banks and insurance providers,
with which Center Parcs interacts on a regular basis, and therefore could adversely affect its ability to raise needed funds
or access liquidity. See “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Description of other Indebtedness.”_

**RISKS RELATING TO TAXATION**

**_Change of tax law and practice might have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Issuer or the Obligors._**

The structure of the transaction, the issuance of the Offered Notes, the ratings that are to be assigned to them
and the statements in relation to taxation set out in this Offering Memorandum are based on current law and the
published practice of the relevant authorities in force or applied as at the date of this Offering Memorandum. Any
changes in such law or practice might have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Issuer or the Obligors and no
assurance can be given as to the effect of any possible judicial decision or change of law or the administrative practice of
any jurisdiction after the date of this Offering Memorandum.

**_Potential secondary tax liabilities of the members of the Obligor Group may result in a deterioration of the Borrowers’_**
**_financial condition which may, in turn, result in a deterioration of the Issuer’s financial condition._**

Where a company fails to discharge certain tax liabilities due and payable by it within a specified time period,
UK tax law imposes, in certain circumstances (including where that company has been sold so that it becomes controlled
by another person), secondary liability for those overdue taxes on other companies that are or have been members of the
same group of companies, or are or have been under common control, for tax purposes with the company that has not
discharged its tax liabilities.

Bidco Parent, Bidco, CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited, Topco, CP Cayman Limited and the Obligors have each
undertaken in the Tax Deed of Covenant that no steps have been or will be taken by it or any other member of the Group
which could be expected to give rise to a secondary tax liability for the Borrowers. If any secondary tax liabilities arise in
the Borrowers (whether in respect of a primary tax liability of a member of the Obligor Group or of another company
with which the Borrowers are or have been grouped or under common control for UK tax purposes), and those secondary
tax liabilities are not discharged by Bidco Parent, Bidco, CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited, Topco, CP Cayman Limited or
any other member of the Obligor Group, and are of significant amounts, the financial condition of the Borrowers could
be adversely affected.

As a general matter, where companies are treated as members of a VAT group, any supply of goods or services
made by or to any member of the group (other than any such supply which is made by or to another member of the group)
is treated as made by or to the representative member of that group. CP Opco (in its capacity as the representative member
of the VAT group) is, therefore, the person required to account to H.M. Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) for any VAT
chargeable on any supply made by or to any member of the VAT group (to or by any person other than another member of
the VAT group). All the other members of the VAT group are jointly and severally liable for any VAT due from CP Opco
to HMRC during their period of membership of the group. CP Opco (in its capacity as the representative member of the
VAT group) has undertaken in the Tax Deed of Covenant that it has paid and will continue to pay all VAT payable by it
to HMRC and to comply with all laws and regulations relating to VAT. However, if such payments are not made and are
of significant amounts, this may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ financial condition and results of
operations. No company which is not an Obligor is a member of the VAT group of which CP Opco is the representative
member.

**_Borrowers’ UK tax position may change which may adversely affect the ability of the Borrowers to repay the Class A_**
**_Loans and Class B Loans and so the ability of the Issuer to repay the Offered Notes._**

There can be no assurance that UK tax law and practice will not change in a manner (including, for example,
an increase in the rate of corporation tax) that would adversely affect the ability of the Borrowers to repay amounts of
principal and interest under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements. Similarly, UK tax law and practice can be subject to
differing interpretations and the Borrowers’ interpretation of the relevant tax law as applied to their transactions and
activities may not coincide with that of HMRC. As a result, transactions of the Borrowers may be challenged by HMRC
and any profits of the Borrowers from their activities in the UK may be assessed to additional tax which may adversely
affect the ability of the Borrowers to repay amounts of principal and interest under the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements. If, in turn, the Issuer does not receive all amounts due from the Borrowers under the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements, the Issuer may not have sufficient funds to enable it to meet its payment obligations under the Offered
Notes and/or any other payment obligations ranking in priority to, or equally with, the Offered Notes.

**_The payments on the Loans may be subject to withholding tax which may result in a prepayment of the Loans, and so_**
**_an early redemption of the Offered Notes, and may also impact on the Borrowers’ ability to repay the Loans in full,_**
**_and so the Issuer’s ability to repay the Offered Notes in full._**

The Borrowers will be required to make payments of interest to the Issuer under the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements without deduction or withholding for or on account of UK income tax if and for so long as the Issuer is and
continues to be a person who is entitled to receive such payments gross of such a deduction or withholding (and the
Borrowers reasonably believe this to be the case). The Issuer has been advised that it was such a person as at the Closing

57


-----

Date, the Second Closing Date, the Third Closing Date, the Fourth Closing Date and the Fifth Closing Date and will be
such a person as at the Sixth Closing Date.

In the event that any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax is required to be made from any
payment due to the Issuer under an Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the amount of that payment will be increased so
that, after such withholding or deduction has been made, the Issuer will receive a cash amount equal to the amount that it
would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required to be made.

If a Borrower is obliged to increase any sum payable by it to the Issuer as a result of such Borrower being
required to make a withholding or deduction from that payment under an Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Borrower
will have the option (but not the obligation) to prepay all relevant outstanding advances made under that Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement in full. If the Borrower chooses to prepay the advances made under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement, the Issuer will then be required to redeem the Class A Notes. Such a redemption would be for a redemption
price equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding on the Class A Notes together with any accrued but unpaid interest. If the
Borrower chooses to prepay the advances made under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer will then
be required to redeem the Class B Notes. Such a redemption would be for a redemption price equal to the Principal Amount
Outstanding on the Class B Notes together with any accrued but unpaid interest. Investors should be aware that no break
costs would be payable to the Class B Noteholders (including holders of the Offered Notes) in such circumstances.

If, in circumstances where a Borrower is required to increase payments made to the Issuer under an
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement as a result of any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax, the Borrower does
not have sufficient funds to enable it either to make increased payments to the Issuer or to repay the relevant
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer’s ability to make timely payments of interest and principal under the Offered
Notes could be adversely affected.

**_If the Issuer were to cease to qualify as a securitisation company, this may have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s UK_**
**_tax position, which could adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make timely payment of interest and principal under_**
**_the Notes (including the Offered Notes)._**

The Issuer is incorporated in Jersey and resident for tax purposes in the UK and has been advised that it should
be a “securitisation company” for the purposes of the Taxation of Securitisation Companies Regulations 2006 (SI
2006/3296) (as amended). Accordingly, the Issuer should be subject to corporation tax in the UK on its “retained profit”
only, in accordance with the special regime for securitisation companies as provided for by those regulations.

If the Issuer were to cease to qualify as a securitisation company for the purposes of those regulations, this
may have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s UK tax position, which could adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make
timely payment of interest and principal under the Offered Notes.

**_The Corporate Interest Restriction Rules or Anti-Hybrid Rules could affect the Borrowers’ ability to obtain tax_**
**_deductions for all their finance expenses which could have an adverse effect on their financial position and their ability_**
**_to meet their payment obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement._**

The Finance (Number 2) Act 2017 inserted a new Part 10 into the Taxation (International and Other Provisions)
Act (TIOPA) with effect from 1 April 2017. Part 10 TIOPA contains the “corporate interest restriction” (CIR) rules, which,
where applicable, provide for the disallowance for corporation tax purposes of some or all of the financing expenses,
including interest expenses, of UK resident companies. Under the CIR rules, financing expenses of UK group companies
can be non-deductible for corporation tax purposes by reference to the net-tax interest expense of the “worldwide group”
of which they are a member. The composition of the worldwide group is largely determined by accounting consolidation.

The application of the CIR rules to the Borrowers, and therefore whether any “allocated disallowance” will arise
to them, depends in part on the composition of the “worldwide group” of which they are members. The composition of the
“worldwide group” depends on the accounting group of which the Borrowers form part. Currently, the Group takes the
view that it is not part of the wider Brookfield group for CIR purposes and forms its own worldwide group. On that basis,
the Group expects to use the “group ratio” rather than the “fixed ratio” method for the purposes of calculating the financing
expenses allowance on the basis that the fixed ratio would result in a greater disallowance for corporation tax purposes of
some or all of the financing expenses of UK group companies within the Group. There can be no assurance that, should
the Borrowers’ accounting group change (for example, because of a divestment of the Center Parcs Group by Brookfield),
or other facts or circumstances arise which affect the application of the “group ratio” or the “fixed ratio” to the Group,
allocated disallowances would not arise to the Borrowers that would require them to leave out of account tax-interest
expense amounts, which broadly means that some or all of their financing expenses, including interest, may not be
deductible for corporation tax purposes. Similarly, UK tax law and practice can be subject to differing interpretations and
the Borrowers’ interpretation of the CIR rules may be challenged by HMRC.

58


-----

Part 6A TIOPA contains rules (the Anti-Hybrid Rules) which can disallow financing expenses of UK resident
companies in certain circumstances, in particular where as a result of the application of non-UK tax rules there is a
deductible payment made by a hybrid entity which is also treated as deductible in calculating the net income of another
person. Members of the Group have made elections for US tax purposes which mean that they are treated as transparent
for US tax purposes, and are therefore “hybrid entities” for these purposes. The application of the Anti-Hybrid Rules to the
Group is therefore dependent on the presence of US investors in the Group and the US tax treatment of income of members
of the Group. Based on current facts the Group does not consider that any disallowance under the Anti-Hybrid Rules is
required. However, there can be no assurance that, should the investors in the Group or the investment structure change,
some of the Group’s financing expenses, including interest, would not be disallowed for corporation tax purposes.

Any of the above scenarios could result in any profits of the Borrowers from their activities in the UK being
assessed to additional tax by reason of the CIR rules or Anti-Hybrid Rules which may adversely affect the Borrowers’ post
tax cash flows. In the event of a material deterioration in Center Parcs’ financial condition and result of operations, it is
possible that such impact on post tax cash flows may contribute to an adverse impact on the ability of the Borrowers to
repay amounts of principal and interest under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements.

**RISKS RELATING TO SECURITY, ENFORCEMENT AND INSOLVENCY**

_The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union took effect on 31 January 2020 (exit day)._ _The UK is no_
_longer an EU Member State. However, in accordance with the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of_
_Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (the_
_“Withdrawal Agreement”), which was implemented by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020, the UK_
_has entered an implementation period, during which it continues to be subject to EU law. The implementation period will_
_cease on 31 December 2020 at 11pm (implementation period completion day). Following implementation period_
_completion day, most of the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council is repealed and_
_will no longer apply to the UK. Article 67(3) of the Withdrawal Agreement, provides that Regulation (EU) 2015/848 will_
_continue to apply provided that the main proceedings were opened before the implementation period completion day._

**_Enforcement of the Topco Share Security is subject to certain conditions which if not met could affect the ability of_**
**_the Class B Noteholders to realise the value of the security._**

Pursuant to the Topco Share Security Agreement, the enforcement of the Topco Share Security is conditional
on the Borrower Security Trustee receiving a tax opinion that confirms that there will not be any actual or contingent tax
liability arising in the Obligor Group as a result of such enforcement of more than £10 million. As at the Sixth Closing
Date, it is not expected that such enforcement would give rise to any tax liability. However, such a liability may arise in
the future due to (among other things) a change in tax law or practice. Should a tax opinion not be provided giving the
requisite confirmations, the Topco Share Security may only be enforced if the Borrower Security Trustee is provided
with sufficient funds, other collateral or other support arrangement to mitigate any such tax liability to the extent it
exceeds £10 million. While the structure of the transaction has been established to minimise the risk of this event
occurring, no assurance can be given by the Obligors that such conditions will be satisfied at the time of enforcement of
the Topco Share Security. As a result, the amounts realised by the Class B Noteholders through enforcement may be
significantly reduced and/or delayed.

**_The enforcement and disposal of the Borrower Secured Property by the Borrower Security Trustee may impact the_**
**_amounts realised by the holders of the Class B3 Notes, the Class B4 Notes and the Class B5 Notes._**

Pursuant to the term of the Intercreditor Agreement, whilst the Class A Notes are outstanding, only the
Class A Noteholders are entitled to direct the Class A Note Trustee, which, in turn, will direct the Issuer Security Trustee
and then the Borrower Security Trustee with regard to the enforcement of any Borrower Security. Neither the Class A
Note Trustee nor the Issuer Security Trustee will be obliged to take into consideration the interests of the Class B
Noteholders when acting in accordance with the directions received from the Class A Noteholders or in exercising their
discretion in relation to enforcement. The Class B Noteholders and any other Secured Creditors will be required to take
any action (for example, release security and/or guarantees) that the Class A Noteholders and/or the Class A Note Trustee
and/or the Issuer Security Trustee (as the case may be) require of them to enforce the Borrower Security including the
extinguishment of all amounts due under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in connection with an
enforcement of the Borrower Security. All amounts realised by the enforcement of the Borrower Security will be applied
in accordance with the relevant Priorities of Payments as stipulated in the Intercreditor Agreement. There is therefore a
risk that the Class B Noteholders’ interests will not be aligned with those of the Class A Noteholders and that the Class B
Note Trustee will be directed to act against the wishes of the Class B Noteholders, and without their control for so long
as the Class A Notes remain outstanding. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor
_Agreement”._

59


-----

For so long as there are any Class B Notes outstanding, the Borrower Security Trustee may only dispose of
any Borrower Secured Property with a value above £10 million if a fairness opinion from a financial advisor is first
obtained. However, the appointment of a financial advisor in such circumstances by the Borrower Security Trustee may
be directed by the Issuer Security Trustee on behalf of the Class A Noteholders only, and the Borrower Security Trustee
shall not be obliged to take into account the interests of any Secured Creditor (other than the Class A Noteholders) and
may only seek direction from the Issuer Security Trustee on behalf of the Class A Noteholders in relation to the method
and timing of the enforcement of such Borrower Secured Property and any matter relating to the fairness opinion. In the
event that a fairness opinion is not able to be produced, the disposal of any Borrower Secured Property will be
undertaken by way of a competitive marketing and sales process typical for such type of assets. Amounts realised by
such a sales process could be less than amounts recovered in a sale by the Borrower Security Trustee. The fairness
opinion will only be required if there are Class B Notes outstanding.

In addition, upon the occurrence of a Loan Event of Default, the Borrower Security Trustee has the power to
appoint an administrative receiver who would take control of all the assets of the English Obligors. Such receiver has
wide powers that would enable him to control the English Obligors and manage Center Parcs’ business in order to repay
the secured debt. In relation to the Propcos, the receiver could endeavour to dispose of the properties, in whole or in part,
either: (i) through the sale of the Borrower Secured Property itself; or (ii) by the sale of the shares in the Propco through
enforcing the share pledge over the shares in the Propco.

In respect of any proposed disposal of the Borrower Secured Property, whether by an administrative receiver
appointed in respect of a Propco or otherwise, the relevant Borrower Secured Property could be sold subject to the terms
of the relevant headlease and the related documentation.

In respect of Longleat, the related documentation provides that the headleases (except the headlease of the
Keepers Cottage activity centre) may be transferred with the consent of the immediate landlord and the superior landlord.
However, in the case of the superior landlord, the documentation does not provide that such consent may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Prior to any transfer of the Keepers Cottage activity centre headlease, the Borrower
Security Trustee is required to offer to surrender the headlease to the superior landlord who has ten working days to
accept a surrender of the Keepers Cottage headlease at the price stipulated in the surrender offer. Therefore, a receiver or
the Borrower Security Trustee may not be able to dispose of the Longleat property directly through a sale of the property
itself or via a special purpose vehicle unless the superior landlord was prepared to give its consent to the assignment of
the Longleat headleases on reasonable terms and does not exercise its pre-emption right in respect of the Keepers Cottage
activity centre. However, there is no restriction on a sale of the shares in the Longleat Propco. Therefore, in such a
scenario, the options available to an administrative receiver could be limited and this could adversely affect the value
which could be achieved on a sale of the Longleat property, although, as noted, this would not prevent the disposal of the
shares in the Longleat Propco to a purchaser.

**_The Borrower Security Trustee will only enforce the Borrower Security if it is instructed to do so by the requisite_**
**_percentage of Class A Noteholders or Class B Noteholders, as the case may be._**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the relevant Instructing Group will be entitled to direct the
relevant trustee to enforce and/or accelerate the Borrower Security or Issuer Security (as applicable). In the case of any
enforcement and/or acceleration of any Borrower Security and Issuer Security, if the Instructing Group is the Class A
Noteholders, then a direction may only be given if such direction is in writing by the holders of at least 25% in aggregate
of the principal amount outstanding of any class of the Class A Notes then outstanding or if so directed by a resolution of
any class of the Class A Noteholders. In the case of the Topco Security (and the Borrower Security and the Issuer
Security, if the Instructing Group is the Class B Noteholders), then a direction may only be given if such direction is in
writing by the holders representing at least 30% in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Class B Notes then
outstanding. There can be no guarantee that the interests of different sub-classes of the Class B Notes will be aligned or
that conflicts of interests will not arise between different sub-classes of the Class B Notes in relation to instructing the
Borrower Security Trustee to enforce the Borrower Security.

**_Guarantees and security may constitute a transaction at an undervalue or preference._**

A liquidator or administrator appointed in England over an Obligor could apply to the court to unwind the
issuance of that Obligor’s guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believed that issuance of such constituted a
transaction at an undervalue. The Obligor Group believes that each guarantee will not be a transaction at an undervalue
and that each guarantee will be provided in good faith for the purposes of carrying on the business of each Obligor and its
subsidiaries and that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the transactions will benefit each such Obligor.
However, there can be no assurance that the provision of the guarantees will not be challenged by a liquidator or
administrator, or that a court would support the Obligor Group analysis.

60


-----

If the liquidator or administrator can show that any of the Obligor Group or one of the Obligors have given a
“preference” to any person within six months of the onset of liquidation or administration (or two years if the preference
is to a “connected person”) and, at the time of the preference, that Obligor Group or that Obligor were unable to pay their
debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 or became unable to do so as a result of the
preferential transaction, a court has the power, among other things, to void the preferential transaction. For these
purposes, a company gives preference to a person if that person is one of the company’s creditors (or a surety or
guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) and the company takes an action which has the effect of putting
that person into a position which, in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the
position that person would have been in if that thing had not been done. The court may not make an order avoiding a
preferential transaction unless it is satisfied that the company was influenced by a desire to put that person in a better
position. This provision of English insolvency law may affect transactions entered into or payments made by any of the
Obligors during the relevant period prior to the liquidation or administration of such Obligor.

In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by a company was made for less than fair value
and was entered into for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of creditors, then the transaction may be set
aside as a transaction defrauding creditors. Any person who is a “victim” of the transaction, and not just liquidators or
administrators, may assert such a claim. There is no statutory time limit within which a claim must be made (although the
normal provisions under the Limitation Act 1980 will apply) and the company need not be insolvent at the time of the
transaction. The Obligors do not believe that they have entered into any transactions which may be regarded as being for
less than fair value or for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of their creditors.

**_The Borrower Security Trustee may be liable to third parties if recharacterised as a mortgagee in possession._**

The Borrower Security Trustee may be deemed to be a mortgagee in possession if there is physical entry into
possession of any village, a step-in enforcement of security or an act of control or influence which may amount, in effect,
to possession.

A mortgagee in possession may incur liabilities to third parties in nuisance and negligence and, under certain
statutes (including environmental legislation), can incur the liabilities of a property owner. The Borrower Security
Trustee has the absolute discretion, at any time, to refrain from taking any action under the Transaction Documents,
including becoming a mortgagee in possession in respect of a village unless it is satisfied at that time that it is adequately
indemnified. Subject to being adequately indemnified under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Borrower
Security Trustee ranks first in respect of the Priorities of Payments, both prior to and following an event of default
thereunder, in respect of payment of any amounts owed to it under its indemnity, including in respect of the liabilities
described in this paragraph.

**_Topco and CP Cayman Limited are companies incorporated in the Cayman Islands and the Topco Share Security_**
**_Agreement is governed by Cayman Islands law. Therefore, Cayman Islands law is applicable to the enforcement of_**
**_the Topco Security._**

If insolvency proceedings with respect to Topco and CP Cayman Limited proceed under, and are governed by,
Cayman Islands insolvency law, the interests of Class B Noteholders may not be as favourable under Cayman Islands
law as the laws of other jurisdictions with which Class B Noteholders are familiar. The application of these laws could
adversely affect the ability of the Borrower Security Trustee to enforce its rights under the security interests granted by a
Cayman Obligor and limit any amounts that may be received by the Class B Noteholders upon such enforcement.

An official liquidator, a voluntary liquidator and a creditor have the power to apply to the Cayman Islands
court (the “Court”) for an order that any security be set aside on the basis that such security was granted in favour of a
creditor at a time when the debtor company was unable to pay its debts pursuant to section 145 of the Companies Law (as
amended) of the Cayman Islands (the "Companies Law"). Any security granted by the debtor company within six
months prior to the commencement of the winding-up may be challenged if the liquidator can prove that the debtor
company granted the security with a view to giving a lender a preference over other creditors. A charge granted in favour
of a related party within six months of the debtor company's winding up will be deemed to have been made with a view
to giving such creditor a preference - this is not rebuttable. A creditor shall be treated as a 'related party' if it has the
ability to control the debtor company or exercise significant influence over the company in making financial and
operating decisions. If any business of a company has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the company or
creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the Court may declare that any persons who were knowingly
parties to the carrying on of such business are liable to make such contributions to the company’s assets as the Court
thinks proper.

If the directors of Topco or CP Cayman Limited have breached their fiduciary duties to act in the best interests
of Topco or CP Cayman Limited (as the case may be) in approving the grant of the relevant security by Topco or CP
Cayman Limited, the security by Topco or CP Cayman Limited may be ineffective as against a liquidator or creditor of

61


-----

Topco or CP Cayman Limited (as the case may be) and, if the recipient of any assets under such security receives the
same with actual or constructive knowledge of such breach by the directors of Topco or CP Cayman Limited, such
recipient may be held to be a constructive trustee of such payment or assets and liable to return the same.

A Cayman Islands court may treat a purported fixed charge over assets as a floating charge if the company has
sufficient authority to deal with its assets in the course of its business and/or if the holder of security does not exercise
sufficient control over the relevant assets. Any charge in the nature of a floating charge will rank behind any subsequent
fixed mortgage or charge or lien which is created prior to the crystallisation of the floating charge. However, advice has
been taken from Cayman Islands counsel that subject to standard reservations and assumptions, the Topco Share Security
Agreement will create a valid security interest over the property intended to be secured by such agreement in favour of
the Borrower Security Trustee and the courts in the Cayman Islands will recognise such security interests.

In the case of a winding up of a Cayman Islands company in a jurisdiction other than the Cayman Islands, the
priority of any security granted by or over the assets of that Cayman Islands company may be affected by any provision
of the laws of that jurisdiction as to the priority of claims in a winding-up. To the extent that the security is held in the
Cayman Islands, failure to comply with any restrictions or provisions applicable to the granting of security over any such
security or the transfer thereof, whether arising under Cayman Islands law generally or pursuant to specific
documentation relating to such security, may, among other things, invalidate any purported security interest.

**_The fiduciary responsibilities of Topco or CP Cayman Limited's directors under Cayman Islands law are not as_**
**_clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions_**

Each of Topco and CP Cayman Limited is an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the
laws of the Cayman Islands. The corporate affairs of each of Topco and CP Cayman Limited will be governed by its
memorandum and articles of association and the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands and other laws of the Cayman
Islands. The rights of the Borrower Security Trustee to take action against the directors of Topco or CP Cayman Limited
and the fiduciary responsibilities of the directors of Topco and CP Cayman Limited to Topco and CP Cayman Limited
respectively under Cayman Islands law are, to a large extent, governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The
common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from
English common law, the decisions of English courts being of persuasive authority, but not binding on a court in the
Cayman Islands. The fiduciary responsibilities of the directors of Topco and CP Cayman Limited under Cayman Islands
law may not be as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions such as
the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws thus providing
significantly less protection to investors as compared to other jurisdictions such as the United States, which has more
fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of securities law.

**_Certain Obligors and the Issuer are incorporated in jurisdictions other than England and Wales and therefore may be_**
**_subject to overseas insolvency law on the security enforcement process._**

While Center Parcs (Jersey) 1 Limited (the “Jersey Obligor”) and the Issuer are incorporated in Jersey, they
will each be a tax resident in the United Kingdom (from where they will be controlled and all management functions will
be operated).

Pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 20 May 2015
(the “Recast EUIR”), which replaced the Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 (“EUIR”) on
insolvency proceedings, “main” insolvency proceedings in respect of a debtor should be opened in the member state in
which its centre of main interests (“COMI”) is located. Under the Recast EUIR, there is a rebuttable presumption that a
company’s COMI is in the place where its registered office is located. This rebuttable presumption only applies if the
registered office has not been moved to another member state within the three-month period prior to the request for the
opening of main insolvency proceedings

The forms of insolvency proceedings which can comprise main proceedings are listed in Annex A to the
Recast EUIR and include, in respect of the UK, administration, compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary
liquidation with confirmation by the court. There is a rebuttable presumption that a company’s COMI is in the place
where its registered office is located. The EUIR remains applicable to insolvency proceedings opened before the Recast
EUIR came into effect.

It is possible to rebut the presumption that a company’s COMI is in the place of its registered office if factors
which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties (meaning that they are already in the public domain and what
a typical third party would learn as a result of dealing with the company, without making specific enquiries) indicate that
the company’s COMI is elsewhere (Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ECJ C-341/2004). Factors which may be taken into account
include the location of any regulatory authorities and the places where the company’s business is managed and operated,
board meetings held and the accounts prepared and audited.

62


-----

The Recast EUIR specifically states in the Recitals (Recital 30) that the presumption of the COMI being at the
place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in a member state
other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors
establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and
supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other member state. In this regard, special
consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a company conducts the administration of its
interests. In the event of a shift in the COMI, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the
company is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g. by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial
correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means).

Where the bodies responsible for the management and supervision of a company are in the same place as its
registered office, and where the management decisions of the company are taken from there, the presumption cannot be
rebutted (Interedil Srl (in liquidation) v Fallimento Interedil Srl and another C-396/09). The point at which a company’s
COMI falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened – although note that under
the Recast EUIR there is the three month look back period as regards the presumption of the company’s COMI.

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the Recast EUIR are to be recognised in other
Member States, although secondary proceedings may additionally be opened in any Member State where the company
has an “establishment”. An establishment is a place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the
3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human
means and goods. This means a fixed place of business and dealings with third parties (as opposed to purely internal
administration). The effect of secondary proceedings is limited to the assets located in that Member State. The forms of
insolvency proceedings which can comprise secondary proceedings are listed in Annex B to the Recast EUIR.

The Recast EUIR contains provisions dealing with the co-ordination of main and secondary proceedings. The
Recast EUIR further contains provisions dealing with insolvency proceedings of members of a group of companies.

Given the fact that the Issuer and the Jersey Obligor are managed and operated from England, and that this is
ascertainable to a third party creditor (such that the creditor would assume their COMI was in England), it is likely that
the Issuer’s and the Jersey Obligor’s COMI is in England as opposed to Jersey. If this is the case, the Issuer and the
Jersey Obligor may be subject to English administration, company voluntary arrangement, and certain liquidation
proceedings. Alternatively, English insolvency law may also be applicable to the Issuer and the Jersey Obligor if a
request for assistance is made by the Jersey court to the English court under section 426 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

Even if the Issuer’s or the Jersey Obligor’s COMI were in England, or section 426 of the Insolvency Act 1986
applied, it is unlikely that it will be possible to appoint an administrative receiver in respect of the Issuer or the Jersey
Obligor in England (so as to prevent the appointment of an English administrator) using the capital market exemption
described in more detail below. This is because notwithstanding the fact that their COMI may be in England, neither the
Issuer nor the Jersey Obligor is likely to be considered to be a “company” for the purposes of section 29 of the
Insolvency Act 1986 since it is not formed under one of the UK Companies Acts.

In respect of any insolvency proceedings in relation to Topco and CP Cayman Limited, the UNCITRAL
Implementing Regulations (as defined below) may apply. This may inhibit the ability of the relevant trustee to appoint a
receiver in respect of Topco and/or CP Cayman Limited or may impose a mandatory stay on insolvency proceedings in
the English courts which ultimately could lead to a delay in the realisation of security and/or a reduction in the amounts
received from such realisation.

The UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency was implemented, subject to certain modifications,
in Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 4 April 2006 by The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, SI 2006/1030
(the “UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations”). The UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations apply where: (i)
assistance is sought in Great Britain by a foreign court or a foreign representative in connection with a foreign
proceeding, or (ii) assistance is sought in a foreign state in connection with a proceeding under British insolvency law, or
(iii) a foreign proceeding and a proceeding under British insolvency law in respect of the same company are taking place
concurrently or (iv) creditors or other interested parties in a foreign state have an interest in requesting the
commencement of, or participating in, a proceeding under British insolvency law.

Under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations, if foreign insolvency proceedings (defined to be collective
judicial or administrative proceedings in a foreign state, including an interim proceeding pursuant to a law relating to
insolvency in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the company are subject to control or supervision by a foreign
court, for the purpose of reorganisation or liquidation) are commenced in respect of a company, then, upon application by
the foreign insolvency officeholder and provided that certain requirements are met, the English courts are required to
recognise such proceedings. Any such recognition may in effect impact upon the availability of certain types of creditor

63


-----

action in England and Wales and/or, provided certain further requirements are met, result in the application of English
avoidance (including claw-back) provisions.

In addition, if the relevant foreign insolvency proceedings are recognised as “foreign main proceedings” (and
there is no conflict with the Recast EUIR), then an automatic mandatory stay on certain types of creditor action
(including the commencement or continuation of certain legal proceedings) will apply in England and Wales and the
right of the company to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose by the company of its assets will be suspended. In
general, this stay will not restrict rights relating to the enforcement of security or set-off (so long as these rights could be
exercised in an English winding-up). However, the foreign officeholder may also make an application to an English court
to exercise its discretion to provide further relief, including the imposition of a wider stay (which may extend to
restrictions on the rights referred to above), particularly if the foreign proceedings in question are reorganisation
proceedings which, under the foreign insolvency law, give rise to a stay on security enforcement.

**_Fixed security interests may be recharacterised as floating security interests due to the degree of control exercised_**
**_over certain underlying assets, including over bank accounts, and as a result the full proceeds of enforcement may not_**
**_be available to repay the Class B3 Notes, the Class B4 Notes and the Class B5 Notes._**

There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the
security documents governed by English law could take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as
fixed charges is not determinative.

Whether the fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security
interests will depend, among other things, on whether the Borrower Security Trustee or, as the case may be, the Issuer
Security Trustee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant assets and exercises that control in practice.

Each Borrower has established a number of bank accounts into which, among other things, rental income and
disposal proceeds in respect of the relevant villages must be paid. Each Borrower has, pursuant to the terms of the
Borrower Deed of Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge, granted security over all of its interests in its relevant
accounts, which is, other than in the case of certain operating accounts, expressed to be a first fixed charge. Furthermore,
under the Issuer Deed of Charge, the Issuer has granted security over all of its bank accounts, which security is also
expressed to be fixed security.

Although the various bank accounts are stated to be subject to various degrees of control, there is a risk that, if
the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee (as applicable) does not exercise the requisite degree of
control over the relevant accounts in practice, a court could determine that the security interests granted in respect of
those accounts take effect as floating security interests only and that the security interests granted over the assets from
which the monies paid into the accounts are derived also take effect as floating security interests only, notwithstanding
that the security interests are expressed to be fixed. In such circumstances, monies paid into accounts or derived from
those assets could be diverted to pay preferential creditors, the costs of the insolvency process, and certain other
liabilities were a receiver, liquidator or administrator to be appointed in respect of the relevant company in whose name
the account is held. Where the charging company is free to deal with the secured assets or their proceeds in the course of
its business without the consent of the charge holder, a court is likely to hold that the security interest in question
constitutes a floating charge, whatever its other characteristics, notwithstanding that in the security document the security
interest may be expressed in words that indicate an intention to create a fixed security interest.

If the fixed security interests are recharacterised as floating security interests, the claims of (i) the unsecured
creditors of the relevant Obligor incorporated in England and Wales (or otherwise subject to insolvency proceedings in
England and Wales) or, as the case may be, the Issuer in respect of that part of the relevant Obligor’s net property which
is ring-fenced as a result of the Enterprise Act 2002 (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the relevant
Obligor, and (iii) in circumstances where a restructuring moratorium has been entered into by the relevant Obligor under
Part A1 of the Insolvency Act 1986 and administration or liquidation commences within 12 weeks of the end of that
moratorium, moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts, may have priority over the rights of the Borrower
Security Trustee or the Issuer Security Trustee, as the case may be, to the proceeds of enforcement of such security in
accordance with s176A and 174A of the Insolvency Act 1986. To the extent that the assets of the Issuer or any Obligor
are subject only to a floating charge (including any fixed charge recharacterised by the courts as a floating charge), in
certain circumstances under the provisions of sections 174A, 176ZA and 176A of the Insolvency Act 1986, certain
floating charge realisations which would otherwise be available to satisfy the claims of secured creditors under the Issuer
Deed of Charge or the Borrower Deed of Charge or the Woburn Deed of Charge may be first used to satisfy any
expenses of the insolvency proceeding, claims of unsecured creditors (up to an amount equal to £800,000 in respect of
each relevant Obligor) or creditors who otherwise take priority over floating charge recoveries. As a result, the full
amount of the proceeds of enforcement of the security may not be available to repay the Notes.

64


-----

Further, the costs and expenses of a liquidation or administration (including corporation tax on capital gains)
will be payable out of floating charge assets in priority to the claims of the floating charge-holder. As a result of the
changes described above, upon the enforcement of the floating charge security granted by an Obligor subject to an
English liquidation or administration, floating charge realisations which would otherwise be available to satisfy the
claims of secured creditors under the Issuer Deed of Charge and/or the Borrower Deed of Charge and/or the Woburn
Deed of Charge will be reduced by at least a significant proportion of any liquidation or administration expenses.

**_Floating charges given by the English Obligors may be deemed invalid for lack of consideration which would hinder_**
**_the appointment of an administrative receiver._**

Section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by a
company may be invalid in whole or in part. If a floating charge is held to be wholly invalid then it will not be possible to
appoint an administrator or administrative receiver of such company and, therefore, it will not be possible to prevent the
appointment of an administrator of such company by another party. The risk is, if a liquidator or administrator is
appointed to the Issuer or the relevant Obligor within a period of one year (or two years if the transaction is with a
connected person) (the “relevant time”) commencing upon the date on which the Issuer or that Obligor, as the case may
be, grants a floating charge, the floating charge granted by the Issuer or that Obligor, as the case may be, will be invalid
pursuant to section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986 except to the extent of the consideration received by the relevant
chargor at the time of or after the creation of the floating charge. The Issuer received consideration (namely, the Issuer
issued the Original Class A Notes and the Original Class B Notes on the Closing Date, the Second Class A Notes on the
Second Issue Date, the Class B2 Notes on the Third Closing Date and the Further Class A4 Notes, the Class B3 Notes
and the Class B4 Notes on the Fourth Closing Date and has received the subscription monies therefor) and each of the
Obligors will have received such consideration (namely, the Borrowers made drawings under the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements on the Closing Date, under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement on the Second Closing Date, under
the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement on the Third Closing Date and under the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements on the Fourth Closing Date). As such, during the relevant time the floating charge granted by the Issuer will
be valid to the extent of the amount of Notes issued by the Issuer, the floating charges granted by the Borrowers will be
valid to the extent of the amount drawn by the Borrowers under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements and the floating
charge granted by each of the other Obligors will be valid to the extent of the fee paid to the other Obligors but not valid
for the full amount of the property charged. However, such limitation on the validity of the floating charges will not
necessarily affect the ability of the Borrower Security Trustee to appoint an administrative receiver provided that the
floating charge still extends and is valid in relation to substantially all of the respective Obligor’s property in respect of
the English Obligors — however, this will be a factual question to be determined at the time of a potential appointment
and the availability of this remedy is discussed in further detail below. After the relevant time it will not be possible for
the floating charges granted by each of the Issuer, the Borrowers or the English Obligors to be invalidated under section
245 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

It should be noted that, since the Jersey Obligor and the Issuer are incorporated in jurisdictions other than
England and Wales, it will not be possible to appoint an administrative receiver in respect of these entities in England (so
as to prevent the appointment of an English administrator) using the capital markets provisions referred to below.
Accordingly, if the Issuer’s and the Jersey Obligor’s COMI were found to be in England, they could be placed into
administration. However, it should be noted that the Issuer is structured to be “bankruptcy remote” so therefore it should
not be subject to any insolvency proceedings. The main asset-owning Obligors (namely CP Opco, CP Woburn Opco and
the Propcos) and their immediate parent companies are all English companies so therefore administrative receivership is
possible for these companies.

**_The ability of the Borrower Secured Creditors to appoint an administrative receiver may be hindered by the_**
**_application of the Enterprise Act 2002 in respect of floating charges._**

The provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the “Enterprise Act”) restrict the right of the holder of a floating
charge to appoint an administrative receiver (unless the security was created prior to 15 September 2003 or an exception
applies) and instead give primacy to collective insolvency procedures (in particular, administration).

The Insolvency Act 1986 contains provisions that continue to allow for the appointment of an administrative
receiver in relation to certain transactions in the capital markets. The relevant exception provides that the appointment of
an administrative receiver is not prohibited if it is made in pursuance of an agreement which is or forms part of a capital
market arrangement (as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986) under which a party incurs or, when such agreement was
entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £50,000,000 and the arrangement involves the issue of a capital
market investment (also defined in the Insolvency Act 1986, but generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). This
exception should be applicable to floating charges created by the English Obligors and assigned by way of security to the
Borrower Security Trustee. However, as this issue is partly a question of fact, were it not possible to appoint an
administrative receiver in respect of one or more of the English Obligors, they would be subject to administration if they
were to become insolvent.

65


-----

It should be noted that, since the Foreign Obligors and the Issuer are incorporated in jurisdictions other than
England and Wales, it is unlikely that it will be possible to appoint an administrative receiver in respect of these entities
in England (so as to prevent the appointment of an English administrator) using the capital markets provisions.
Accordingly, if the Issuer’s and the Foreign Obligors’ COMI were found to be in England, they could be placed into
administration. However, it should be noted that the Issuer is structured to be “bankruptcy remote” so therefore it should
not be subject to any insolvency proceedings. The main asset-owning Obligors (namely CP Opco, CP Woburn Opco and
the Propcos) and their immediate parent companies are all English companies so therefore administrative receivership is
possible for these companies.

The UK Secretary of State may, by secondary legislation, modify the exceptions to the prohibition on
appointing an administrative receiver and/or provide that the exception shall cease to have effect. No assurance can be
given that any such modification or provision in respect of the capital market exception, or its ceasing to be applicable to
the transactions described in this Offering Memorandum, will not be detrimental to the interests of the Class B
Noteholders.

**_The ability of certain members of the Obligor Group to seek a moratorium which could restrict creditors’ ability to_**
**_enforce security._**

Pursuant to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, which received Royal Assent on
25 June 2020 and came into effect on 26 June 2020, a free-standing moratorium is available to protect certain companies,
both UK and overseas if there is a sufficient connection with England, from creditor action for a specified period,
granting a ‘payment holiday’ for ‘pre-moratorium debts’. Pre-moratorium debts are debts due prior to the moratorium
coming into force or debts which become due during the moratorium if they relate to obligations incurred before the
moratorium comes into force. The moratorium is similar in scope to that which applies in administration, preventing
security enforcement and legal proceedings amongst other things. In order to be eligible for the moratorium a member of
the Obligor Group must be or likely to be unable to pay its debts and the moratorium must be likely to result in the rescue
of the company as a going concern. However, there are broad exclusions including for companies which are party to a
capital markets arrangement. As a result, the moratorium is not available to members of the Obligor Group.
**RISKS RELATING TO THE OFFERED NOTES**

**_The Offered Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors._**

Each potential investor in the Offered Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its
own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

         - have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Offered Notes, the
merits and risks of investing in the Offered Notes and the information contained in this Offering
Memorandum;

        - have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular
financial situation, an investment in the Offered Notes and the impact the Offered Notes will have on its
overall investment portfolio;

        - have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Offered
Notes, including Offered Notes where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from
the potential investor’s currency;

         - understand thoroughly the terms of the Offered Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant
indices and financial markets; and

         - be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial advisor) possible economic and interest
rate scenarios and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.

The Offered Notes are complex financial instruments. Sophisticated institutional investors generally do not
purchase complex financial instruments as standalone investments. They purchase complex financial instruments as a
way to reduce risk or enhance yield with an understood, measured and appropriate addition of risk to their overall
portfolios. A potential investor should not invest in Offered Notes that are complex financial instruments unless it has the
expertise (either alone or with a financial advisor) to evaluate how the Offered Notes will perform under changing
conditions, the resulting effects on the value of the Offered Notes and the impact this investment will have on the
potential investor’s overall investment portfolio.

In addition, the market value of the Offered Notes may fluctuate for a number of reasons including due to
prevailing market conditions, current interest rates and the perceived creditworthiness of the Issuer and the Obligors. Any

66


-----

perceived threat of insolvency or other financial difficulties of the Obligors or a less favourable outlook of the holiday
industry in the UK could result in a downgrade of ratings and/or a decline in market value of the Offered Notes.

**_The Issuer is a special purpose company with no business operations or assets._**

The Offered Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer. The Issuer is a special purpose company with
no business operations other than the issuance of the Notes and the transactions ancillary thereto. The Offered Notes are
not obligations or responsibilities of, or guaranteed by, any other entity.

The Offered Notes are not obligations or responsibilities of, and are not guaranteed by, the Class A Note
Trustee, the Class B Note Trustee, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners,
the Liquidity Facility Providers, the Cash Manager, the Paying Agents, the Class A Registrar, the Class B Registrar, the
Class A Transfer Agent, the Class B Transfer Agent, the Issuer Account Bank, the Borrower Account Bank, the
Borrower Security Trustee, any of the Obligors or any company in the same group of companies as, or affiliated to, the
Parent (other than the Issuer itself but without prejudice to the Obligors’ obligations to the Issuer under the
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements). Furthermore, no such person other than the Issuer will accept any liability
whatsoever to holders of the Offered Notes in respect of any failure by the Issuer to pay any amounts due under the
Offered Notes.

The ability of the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Offered Notes will be dependent on:

(a) the receipt by it of funds from the Obligors under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;
and

(b) the receipt by it of interest (if any) from monies standing to the credit of the Issuer Transaction
Account, or otherwise from certain Eligible Investments (each as defined below) made by it or on
its behalf.

**_The Class B Notes are subordinated to the Class A Notes and rank behind the Class A Notes as to payment and_**
**_security._**

Pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, payments to be made to the Class B Noteholders in
respect of principal and interest in relation to the Class B Notes, including the Class B5 Notes, will be subordinated to
payments in respect of the Class A Notes in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payments. The Obligors will not
permitted to pay interest due and payable on Class B Loans and subsequently the Issuer will not be able to make
payments on the Class B Notes in the event that the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is no longer satisfied on any
Note Interest Payment Date (unless such payment is made using New Equity Funds received for this purpose).

Furthermore, the Class B Noteholders have limited ability to call a Class B Note Event of Default and a Class
B Loan Event of Default and rank behind the Class A Noteholders in respect of any amounts realised through the
enforcement of security granted under the Issuer Deed of Charge or the Borrower Deed of Charge or the Woburn Deed of
Charge. There is a risk that the proceeds of an enforcement of security at either the Borrowers’ level or the Issuer level
will not be sufficient to meet the Issuer’s payment obligations with respect to the Class B Notes following the full
repayment of its obligations under the Class A Notes. Furthermore, in certain Class A Loan enforcement scenarios, Class
B Loans may be extinguished — see the section “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor
_Agreement”. However, the Class B Notes indirectly benefit from the Topco Payment Undertaking and first ranking_
security under the Topco Share Security — see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Topco Payment
_Undertaking — Topco Share Security Agreement”._

See “Risks relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency”, “Description of other Indebtedness — Class A
_Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement” and “Description of the Class B5 Loan” for further details._

**_Risks in relation to the proceeds received from the enforcement of the Topco Security Documents for the Class B_**
**_Loans and Class B Notes._**

Pursuant to the Topco Payment Undertaking, Topco will undertake to pay or procure the payment of an
amount equal to the aggregate of: (i) the then principal balance of the Class B Loans; (ii) accrued but unpaid interest
outstanding in respect of the Class B Loans, Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid
interest thereon; (iii) any Additional Amounts; and (iv) all other amounts due and payable under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, on the earlier of (A) the date on which any amount under a Class B Loan remains
outstanding at the close of business on the Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date for such Class B Loan and (B) the date
on which Topco receives a valid demand notice from the Borrower Security Trustee following the occurrence of a Share
Enforcement Event and/or a Class B Loan Event of Default. In addition, Topco will grant as security all of its shares in
CP Cayman Limited in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee to hold for the benefit of the Issuer under the Topco

67


-----

Security Documents. CP Cayman Limited will then grant as security all of its shares in Center Parcs (Holdings 1)
Limited in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee to hold for the benefit of the Issuer under the CP Cayman Security
Agreement.

The Borrower Security Trustee on behalf of the Issuer will be entitled to enforce the Topco Security
Documents upon any Share Enforcement Event pursuant to the Transaction Documents. Such enforcement by the
Borrower Security Trustee will not constitute either a Class A Note Event of Default, or a Class B Note Event of Default.
If, for example, upon the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event, the Borrower Security Trustee enforces the Topco
Security Documents, the Obligor Group could be owned by a different entity. Any such change in ownership of the
Obligor Group would not constitute a change of control under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements but may have an
adverse effect on the business and administration of Center Parcs and may affect the Borrowers’ ability to make
repayments on the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements when they fall due and as such affect the ability of the Issuer to
repay both the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes.

If a Share Enforcement Event has occurred and is continuing only the Class B Instructing Group (acting upon
a resolution passed by the holders representing at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Class B
Notes then outstanding) may direct the Issuer Security Trustee to require the Borrower Security Trustee to enforce the
Topco Security. There can be no guarantee that the interests of different sub-classes of the Class B Notes will be aligned
or that conflicts of interests will not arise between different sub-classes of the Class B Notes in relation to instructing the
Borrower Security Trustee to enforce the Topco Security.

No assurance can be given that the proceeds realised as a result of an enforcement of any Topco Security
Documents will be sufficient to discharge in full the amounts due on the Class B5 Loan and as a result the Class B5
Notes, nor that the holders of the Class B5 Notes will not be adversely affected by such realisation or enforcement. See
“Risks relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency”.

**_Center Parcs may not be able to repurchase the Offered Notes upon a Class B Change of Control with respect to a_**
**_series of Offered Notes and it may not be certain that a Class B Change of Control has occurred or will occur. In_**
**_addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Class B5 Notes in_**
**_connection with a tender offer even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a
“change of control”. Upon a Class B Change of Control under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement with respect
to any Offered Notes, the Borrowers will be required to make an offer to repurchase all the outstanding Offered Notes of
such series at a premium, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. In such a situation, the
Borrowers may not have enough funds to repurchase all of the outstanding Offered Notes. In addition, by virtue of
provisions in the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Obligors may be prohibited from repurchasing the
Offered Notes upon a Class B Change of Control. A Class B Change of Control in this regard may cause disruption to the
Center Parcs Group and may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Class B5 Loan and agreements governing
any future indebtedness. As a result of such events occurring, the Class B5 Loan and any future indebtedness may be
accelerated.

For purposes of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, a “change of control” will include a disposition
of all or substantially all the assets of Topco and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain third parties.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction in fact involves a disposition of “all or substantially all” the assets of
Topco and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Class B Change of
Control has occurred and with respect to the Offered Notes whether Center Parcs will be required to make an offer to
repurchase all the Offered Notes at the price described above. In addition, a Class B Change of Control with respect to
the Offered Notes is only be deemed to have been triggered if, along with the occurrence of a “change of control”, the
current rating of the Offered Notes is downgraded.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Class B5 Notes, if holders of not less than 90 per
cent. in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B5 Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such
Class B5 Notes in such tender offer and a Borrower purchases all of the Class B5 Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such holders, the Borrowers may prepay the remaining principal amount of the Class B5 Loan, in whole,
but not in part, at a price equal to the purchase price offered to holders of the Class B5 Notes pursuant to such tender
offer and the Issuer will be required to apply the proceeds received from such prepayment to redeem a corresponding
principal amount of Class B5 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued
but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, at a redemption price corresponding to the prepayment
price. See ““Description of the Class B5 Loan—Prepayment—Optional Prepayment”.

**_The holders of the Offered Notes will rank behind certain third parties in respect of certain obligations of the Issuer_**
**_and the Borrowers._**

Although the Issuer Security Trustee will hold the benefit of the Issuer Security on trust for the holders of the
Offered Notes and the Borrower Security Trustee will hold the benefit of the Borrower Security on trust for the Borrower
Secured Creditors, such security interests will also be held on trust for certain third parties. Certain obligations of the
Issuer to third parties will rank ahead of the holders of the Offered Notes. Such persons include, among others, the Class
B Note Trustee (in its individual capacity), the Class A Note Trustee (in its individual capacity), the Issuer Security
Trustee (in its individual capacity), the Liquidity Facility Providers, the Paying Agents and the Issuer Account Bank in
respect of certain amounts owed to them. To the extent that significant amounts are owing to any such persons, the
amounts available to the holders of the Offered Notes will be reduced. Likewise, certain of the Borrowers’ obligations to
certain third parties will rank ahead of their obligations to the Issuer.

In addition, unsecured creditors of the Borrowers, such as trade creditors and suppliers, while subordinate to
the Borrower Secured Creditors, are not bound into the financing structure as they are not parties to the Borrower Deed
of Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge and so will be able to proceed directly against each of the Borrowers where
they fail to pay any unsecured debts as they fall due. For a more detailed description of the Priorities of Payments by the
Issuer and by the Borrowers both prior and subsequent to the enforcement of the security thereunder, see “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements — Issuer Deed of Charge” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —_
_Intercreditor Agreement”._

**_The Issuer is dependent on third parties for the provision of certain services in relation to the Offered Notes._**

The Issuer is a party to contracts with a number of third parties who have agreed to perform certain services in
relation to, among other things, the Offered Notes. For example, the Issuer English Corporate Services Provider and the
Issuer Jersey Corporate Services Provider have agreed to provide various corporate services to the Issuer and to the
Issuer Parent, and the Cash Manager, the Issuer Account Banks and the Paying Agents have agreed to provide, among
other things, payment, administration and calculation services in connection with the Offered Notes. In the event that any
relevant third party fails to perform its obligations under the respective agreements to which it is a party, the holders of
the Offered Notes may be adversely affected.

**_The interests of Center Parcs’ principal shareholder may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Offered_**
**_Notes._**

The interests of Center Parcs’ principal shareholder, in certain circumstances, may conflict with the interests
of the holders of the Offered Notes. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Brookfield Funds own
approximately 99% of Center Parcs’ shares and certain employees and members of management own the remainder. See
“Principal Shareholder”. As a result, the Brookfield Funds have, directly or indirectly, the power, among other things, to
affect Center Parcs’ legal and capital structure and Center Parcs’ day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and
change Center Parcs’ management and board of directors and to approve any other changes to Center Parcs’ operations.
For example, the Brookfield Funds could decide to cause Center Parcs to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain
material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements and the Intercreditor
Agreement so permit. The interests of the Borrowers’ ultimate shareholders could conflict with the holders of the Offered
Notes’ interests, particularly if they encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay their debts when due. The
incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase Center Parcs’ debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets
could reduce Center Parcs’ ability to generate revenue, each of which could adversely affect holders of the Offered
Notes.

**_There may be conflicts of interest between the holders of the different classes of the Notes and the Issuer may not be_**
**_able to repay the Offered Notes._**

The Class B Note Trustee will be required to have regard only to the interest of the holders of existing Class B
Notes and new Class B Notes issued after the Sixth Closing Date as if they formed a single class with existing Class B
Notes when exercising his powers, trusts, authorities, duties and discretions (except in certain circumstances as set out in
the Note Trust Deed). Holders of each class of Notes may find their voting powers diluted by the creation of new Notes
and/or any further Notes.

The Class A Noteholders and Class B Noteholders each indirectly benefit from the covenant package given by
the Obligors in relation to each of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement. Each of the Class A Noteholders and/or Class B Noteholders may waive any breach of covenant specific to
those covenants given in their respective Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement without the consent of the alternate class of
Noteholders. There is a risk therefore that the Class A Noteholders may waive or amend the Class A Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement without regard to the consequences for the holders of the Offered Notes. Additionally, where new

69


-----

Class A Notes and/or Further Class A Notes are issued, there is an increased risk that the Offered Notes may not be fully
repaid by the Issuer.

**_The Class A Note Trustee may modify certain provisions of, or otherwise make decisions with respect to the Offered_**
**_Notes without consent of the holders of the Offered Notes._**

The Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee)
will be entitled to agree, without the consent of the relevant Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders and any other
Issuer Secured Creditors, with the Issuer and any other relevant party to any of the Issuer Transaction Documents in
making any modification to the Class A Conditions, the Class B Conditions, the Note Trust Deed (other than (in the case
of (c) and (d) below) in respect of either a Class A Basic Terms Modification or a Class B Basic Terms Modification),
the Class B3 Notes, the Class B4 Notes, the Class B5 Notes, or any other Issuer Transaction Documents to which it is a
party or over which it has security, or may give its consent to any event, matter or thing, if:

(a) in its opinion, the interest of the Class A Noteholders would not be materially prejudiced thereby;
or

(b) in its opinion, such modification is required to correct a manifest error or is of a formal, minor,
administrative, or technical nature or one in respect of which the English court could reasonably
be expected to make a rectification order; or

(c) to the extent such event, matter or thing relates to an Entrenched Right and in its opinion, such
modification is required to correct a manifest error or is of a formal, minor, administrative or
technical nature; or

(d) it is required or permitted, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions, under the terms of the
Class A Conditions, the Class B Conditions or the Issuer Transaction Documents provided such
conditions are satisfied.

The Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee)
shall be entitled to determine, in its own opinion, for the purposes of exercising any right, power, trust, authority, duty or
decision under or in relation to the Class A Notes (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B
Note Trustee in relation to the Offered Notes), the Class A Conditions (or following the full redemption of the Class A
Notes, the Class B Note Trustee in relation to the Class B Conditions) or any of the Issuer Transaction Documents, that
such exercise will not be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class A Noteholders (or following the full
redemption of the Class A Notes, the holders of the Class B3 Notes, Class B4 Notes, and/or Class B5 Notes, as
applicable) or any relevant class thereof and in making such a determination shall be entitled to take into account,
amongst any other things it may consider necessary and/or appropriate in its absolute discretion, any confirmation by the
Rating Agencies (if available) that the then current rating of the Class A Notes (or following the full redemption of the
Class A Notes, the Class B3 Notes, Class B4 Notes, and/or the Class B5 Notes, as applicable), or as the case may be, the
relevant class thereof will not be downgraded, withdrawn or qualified, and that, where any original rating of the Class A
Notes (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B3 Notes, Class B4 Notes, and/or the Class B5
Notes, as applicable) has been and continues to be downgraded, restoration of such original rating would not be
prevented, as a result of such exercise. For the avoidance of doubt, such rating confirmation or non-receipt of such rating
confirmation shall, however, not be construed to mean that any such action or inaction (or contemplated action or
inaction) or such exercise (or contemplated exercise) by the Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the
Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee) of any relevant right, power, trust, authority, duty or decision under or in
relation to the Class A Notes (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B3 Notes, Class B4 Notes,
and/or the Class B5 Notes, as applicable), the Class A Conditions (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes,
the Class B Conditions) or any other Issuer Transaction Documents is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the
holders of the Class A Notes or, as the case may be, that Class of Notes and the non-receipt of such ratings confirmation
shall not be construed to mean that such exercise by the Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the
Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee) as aforesaid is materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class A Noteholders
or, as the case may be, the Notes of the relevant Class.

The Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee)
may, without the consent or sanction of the Class A Noteholders, the holders of the Offered Notes or any other Issuer
Secured Creditors, authorise or waive any proposed breach of the covenants or provisions contained in the Note Trust
Deed, the Class A Notes, the Offered Notes, or any other Issuer Transaction Documents or determine that a Class A Note
Event of Default and/or a Class B Note Event of Default shall be treated as such if certain conditions are satisfied. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness — Class A Notes” and “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes”.

**_The Issuer Security Trustee and the Borrower Security Trustee may modify certain provisions of, or otherwise make_**
**_decisions with respect to the Issuer Transaction Document and the Borrower Transaction Document without consent_**
**_of the holders of the Offered Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that in connection with the accession of any Additional Site and
issue of any additional Notes or making any additional loans, any consequential amendments, consents or waivers
required to be made or granted pursuant to any Transaction Document to give effect to such transaction or transactions
will not (a) constitute an Entrenched Right and so not require the consent of any Affected Secured Creditor (and such
Affected Secured Creditor may be any of the holders of the Offered Notes) to effect such changes and (b) will not
constitute a General Matter and so will not require the consent of the relevant Instructing Group (and such relevant
Instructing Group may be any of the holders of the Offered Notes) to effect such changes. The Issuer Security Trustee
and the Borrower Security Trustee will be authorised to execute any documents and to give effect to such changes
without incurring any liability for doing so.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Borrower Security Trustee in respect of a Borrower
Transaction Document and the Issuer Security Trustee in respect of an Issuer Transaction Document may approve an
amendment, waiver or consent in respect of such document if it is of the opinion that the relevant action is formal, minor,
administrative or technical, or one in respect of which the English court could reasonably be expected to make a
rectification order (“Relevant Action”). In such circumstances, such Relevant Action may be taken without the consent
of the holders of the Offered Notes, the Issuer Secured Creditors or the Borrower Secured Creditors. The Relevant Action
may be taken in respect of an Entrenched Right.

The Issuer Security Trustee, Borrower Security Trustee, the Class A Note Trustee and Class B Note Trustee
will each not liable for the failure by the Clearing Systems to deliver notices to holders of the Offered Notes in a timely
manner.

In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and certain other Transaction Documents, the Issuer
Security Trustee and the Borrower Security Trustee will have various powers, authorities and discretions to agree to
amendments to certain provisions and to the taking of certain steps by the Obligors without the consent of the Borrower
Secured Creditors or the Issuer Secured Creditors (as applicable). See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements
_— Intercreditor Agreement — Amendments, Consents and Waivers — General Procedures”._

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer Security
Trustee may concur with the Obligor Group Agent in making any amendment to give any consent under, or grant any
waiver in respect of, any breach or proposed breach which is not, in the opinion of the Borrower Security Trustee,
materially prejudicial to the interests of the Borrower Secured Creditors, or in the opinion of the Issuer Security Trustee
(as applicable) is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Issuer Secured Creditors (and in the case of any holders
of the Offered Notes in their capacity as Issuer Secured Creditors, where the Class B Note Trustee is of the opinion that
the relevant amendment, consent or waiver is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the Offered
Notes).

**_Holders of the Class B5 Notes will have recourse to any additional villages that Center Parcs constructs or acquires in_**
**_the United Kingdom only if and when certain conditions under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement are_**
**_satisfied following completion of the development of such additional villages. These conditions may not be satisfied_**
**_when expected, or at all._**

The revenues derived from any additional village that Center Parcs constructs or acquires in the United
Kingdom will not benefit the Restricted Group unless and until certain conditions in the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements that allow accession of additional sites to the Restricted Group are satisfied and the formal accession process
is completed. Furthermore, the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements will allow the Obligors, subject to various conditions,
to raise further debt in the form of additional loans to fund the accession of additional sites to the Obligor Group.

The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement provides that the Borrowers must use all reasonable endeavours
to procure the accession of the relevant additional village site in the United Kingdom within three years of either the
acquisition of the relevant additional village or the additional village becoming operational and starting to receive paying
guests, whichever is later. The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement further provides (among other things) that if the
market conditions are such that the accession of the relevant additional village to the Obligor Group would not be
executable in a “commercially reasonable manner (having regard to the then expected pricing for such acquisition)” then
the Borrowers will not be required to procure accession at that time but as soon as possible after that time. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness — Class A IBLA — Additional Site Entities”.

While the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will not require the satisfaction of similar conditions, so
long as the Class A Notes are outstanding, the holders of the Class B5 Notes will not have recourse to any additional

71


-----

villages in the United Kingdom unless the conditions under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement are satisfied.
Accordingly, unless and until the accession conditions are satisfied and any relevant additional village located in the
United Kingdom is transferred to the Obligor Group in accordance with the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,
the business that supports interest and principal on the Notes may be negatively impacted by any such additional village
without receiving any benefits or income expected to be derived from the additional village. Accordingly, development
and operation of any additional village in the United Kingdom may materially and adversely affect the Obligors’
financial condition, results of operations and the Obligors’ ability to pay interest and principal on the Notes.

In addition, none of the Obligors will own assets relating to, or derive revenues from, Longford Forest or any
other additional village outside the United Kingdom. Holders of the Class B5 Notes will not have recourse to any such
village outside the United Kingdom, its assets, revenues or cash flow. See “—Holders of the Class B Notes will not have
_recourse to any additional village outside the United Kingdom, its assets, revenues or cash flow. Development of any_
_such village may divert management’s time from villages in the United Kingdom.”_

**_Regulatory initiatives may result in increased regulatory capital requirements and/or decreased liquidity in respect of_**
**_the Offered Notes._**

In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there has been increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the assetbacked securities industry in recent years. This has resulted in numerous measures for increased regulation which are
currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to
certain investors in certain securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to invest in securities issued
under such structures, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.

Holders of the Offered Notes should consult their own advisers as to the consequences to, and effect on, them
of the application of Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (together “CRD”), Regulation (EU)
No. 231/2013 (the “AIFM Regulation”) and Article 254 of Regulation (EU) No. 35/2015 (the “Solvency II
**Regulation”), each as implemented by their own regulator, to their holding of any Class B5 Notes. The Issuer will not**
responsible for informing holders of the Offered Notes of the effects of the changes to risk-weighting which will result
for investors from the adoption of CRD, the AIFM Regulation and the Solvency II Regulation by their own regulator.

**_The Offered Notes will be new securities for which there is no established trading market._**

The Offered Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no market. The Class B Global
Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners may make a market in the Offered Notes as permitted by applicable laws and
regulations; however, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners are not obligated to make a market in the
Offered Notes and they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore, Center
Parcs cannot assure any investor as to the development or liquidity of any trading market for the Offered Notes. The
liquidity of any market for the Offered Notes will depend on a number of factors, including:

        - the number of holders of the Offered Notes;

         - the operating performance and financial condition of Center Parcs;

         - the market for similar securities;

        - the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Offered Notes; and

         - prevailing interest rates.

Historically, the debt capital markets have been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in
the prices of securities similar to the Offered Notes. Center Parcs cannot assure investors that the market, if any, for the
Offered Notes will be free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect the prices at
which the investors may sell the Offered Notes. Therefore, Center Parcs cannot assure investors that they will be able to
sell the Offered Notes at a particular time nor that the Offered Notes will receive a favourable price from such sale.
Consequently, investors in the Offered Notes should be aware that they may have to hold the Offered Notes until their
maturity.

In addition, the market value of the Offered Notes may fluctuate with changes in prevailing rates of interest,
market perceptions of the risks associated with the Offered Notes, supply and other market conditions. Consequently, any
sale of Offered Notes by the holders of the Offered Notes in any secondary market which may develop may be at a
discount to the original purchase price of such Offered Notes.

**_the Offered Notes, including as a result of the effect of COVID-19 on past and future performance._**

The ratings assigned to the Offered Notes by S&P and Fitch address the likelihood of full and timely payment
to the holders of the Offered Notes of all payments of interest due on each Note Interest Payment Date and the full
repayment of principal of the Offered Notes on or before the relevant final maturity date. There is no assurance that any
such ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be reviewed, revised, suspended or withdrawn
entirely by the Rating Agencies as a result of changes in or unavailability of information or if, in the Rating Agencies’
judgement, circumstances so warrant. Rating organisations other than the Rating Agencies could seek to rate the Offered
Notes and, if such “unsolicited ratings” are lower than the comparable rating assigned to the Offered Notes by the Rating
Agencies, such “shadow ratings” could have an adverse effect on the value of the Offered Notes.

Furthermore, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, although Fitch affirmed the Issuer’s credit rating on
18 June 2020 and S&P affirmed the BBB credit rating of the Issuer’s Class A Notes on 16 July 2020, the credit rating of
the Issuer’s Class B Notes was downgraded to B- on 16 July 2020 by S&P. See“—Risks Relating to Center Parcs’
_Business and Industry—_ _The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect Center_
_Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.”_

In addition, future events, including events affecting Center Parcs, could have an adverse impact on the ratings
of the Offered Notes (as to which, see “— Risks Relating to the Financing Structure — Sale of a Propco may have an
_adverse effect on the ability of the Borrowers to meet their obligations under the Loans and ultimately affect the_
_repayments on the Notes by the Issuer”.)_

Where a particular matter (including the determination of material prejudice by the Class B Note Trustee)
involves each of S&P and Fitch being requested to confirm that a proposed action would not result, in the case of S&P, in
a downgrade or a CreditWatch placement, or in the case of Fitch, in the downgrade of the then current rating of the
Offered Notes, such confirmation is given at the sole discretion of the relevant Rating Agency. Depending on the timing
of delivery of the request and any relevant information, there is a risk that the relevant Rating Agency cannot provide its
confirmation in the time available or at all. No Rating Agency will be responsible for the consequences of any failure to
deliver a Ratings Assessment or confirmation on any particular timescale.

Confirmation, if given, will be given on the basis of the facts and circumstances prevailing at the relevant
time, and in the context of cumulative changes to the transaction of which the Offered Notes form part since the Sixth
Closing Date. A confirmation of ratings represents only a restatement of the opinions given at the Sixth Closing Date,
and cannot be construed as advice for the benefit of any parties to the transaction or as confirmation that an event or
amendment is in the best interest of, or not materially prejudicial to the interests of, the holders of the Offered Notes. No
assurance can be given that a requirement to seek a ratings confirmation will not have a subsequent impact upon the
business of the Issuer.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Issuer Security Trustee, Borrower Security
Trustee, the Class A Note Trustee and the Class B Note Trustee will acknowledge that they do not have any right of
recourse to or against either Rating Agency in respect of a Ratings Assessment which either the Issuer Security Trustee
or Borrower Security Trustee relies upon.

Reliance by the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee on any Ratings Assessment will not
create, impose on or extend to either Rating Agency any actual or contingent liability to any person (including, without
limitation, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee and/or any holders of the Class B5 Notes) or create
any legal relations between Fitch and the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee, the Class A Global
Coordinator and Arranger, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners, any Noteholder or any other person
whether by way of contract or otherwise.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision,
suspension or withdrawal at any time by the assigning Rating Agency.

In respect of a disposal of a Propco or a holiday park owned by a Propco made pursuant to the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, a Ratings Assessment is required to be obtained from each of S&P and Fitch. If either
Rating Agency delivers such a Ratings Assessment, such Ratings Assessment will be prepared and delivered by either
Rating Agency on the following limited basis:

(a) a Ratings Assessment will be a point-in-time assessment which:

(i) will not constitute a credit rating by either Rating Agency;

73


-----

(ii) will not be monitored by either Rating Agency and therefore will not be updated to
reflect changed circumstances or information that may affect the Ratings Assessment;
and

(iii) will not address other matters that may be of relevance to the Noteholders,

and such Ratings Assessment will be issued on the basis that the Issuer Security Trustee, the
Borrower Security Trustee and each Noteholder will be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed
to the above terms;

(b) none of the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee or any Noteholder will have
any right of recourse to or against either Rating Agency in respect of a Ratings Assessment which
is relied upon by the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee; and

(c) reliance by the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee on any Ratings
Assessment will not create, impose on or extend to either Rating Agency any actual or contingent
liability to any person (including, without limitation, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower
Security Trustee and/or any Noteholder) or create any legal relations between either Rating
Agency and the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee, the Class A Global
Coordinator and Arranger, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners, any
Noteholder or any other person whether by way of contract or otherwise.

**_Definitive Notes not having denominations in integral multiples of the minimum authorised denomination may have_**
**_difficulty in trading in the secondary market._**

The Offered Notes have a denomination consisting of a minimum authorised denomination of £100,000 plus
higher integral multiples of £1,000 up to £199,000. Accordingly, it is possible that the Offered Notes may be traded in
amounts in excess of the minimum authorised denomination that are not integral multiples of such denomination. In such
a case, if Definitive Notes are required to be issued, a Noteholder of the Offered Notes who holds a principal amount less
than the minimum authorised denomination at the relevant time may not receive a Definitive Note in respect of such
holding and may need to purchase a principal amount of Offered Notes such that their holding amounts to the minimum
authorised denomination (or another relevant denomination amount).

If Definitive Notes are issued, holders of the Offered Notes should be aware that Definitive Notes which have
a denomination that is not an integral multiple of the minimum authorised denomination may be illiquid and difficult to
trade.

**_Offered Notes in book-entry form are subject to the rules of Euroclear and Clearstream, respectively, which may not_**
**_be adequate to ensure the owners their timely exercise of rights under the Offered Notes._**

The Offered Notes will initially only be issued in global form and deposited with a common depository for
Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests in the Global Note trade in book-entry form only. The common depository, or its
nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream, is the sole holder of the Global Note. Accordingly, owners of book-entry
interests must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, and non-participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg, must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interests, to
exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Offered Notes.

Unlike the holders of the Offered Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct
right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Offered
Notes. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, may not be adequate to
ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Offered Notes.

**_Prepayment of the Class B5 Loan may negatively affect the projected yield to maturity of the Offered Notes._**

The yield to maturity of the Offered Notes will depend on, amongst other things, the amount and timing of
repayment and prepayment of principal on the Class B5 Loan and the price paid by the holders of the Offered Notes.
Such yield may be adversely affected by a higher or lower than anticipated rate of prepayment on the Class B5 Loan. The
rate of prepayment of the Class B5 Loan cannot be predicted and will be influenced by a wide variety of economic and
other factors, including prevailing interest rates, the buoyancy of the UK holiday centre market, the availability of
alternative financing and local and regional economic conditions. Therefore, no assurance can be given as to the level of
prepayment that will be experienced. In addition, Topco will be required to immediately repay all of the Class B Loans
(including the Class B5 Loan) in the event that (1) any Class B Loan remains outstanding at the close of business on the
Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date for such Class B Loan or (2) Topco receives a valid demand notice from the
Borrower Security Trustee following the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event and/or a Class B Loan Event of

74


-----

Default. The Class B3 Loan Expected Maturity Date and the Class B4 Loan Expected Maturity Date both occur prior to
the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date and therefore failure by the Borrowers to repay the Class B3 Loan or Class
B4 Loan on or prior to such dates may result in enforcement of the Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco Security
Documents which in turn may result in the Class B5 Loan being repaid prior to the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity
Date.

**_Changes of law may have a negative impact on the ability of the Issuer to meet its payment obligations under the_**
**_Offered Notes._**

The transactions described in this Offering Memorandum (including the issuance of the Offered Notes) and
the ratings assigned to the Offered Notes are based on the relevant law and administrative practice in effect as at the date
hereof, and having regard to the expected tax treatment of all relevant entities under such law and practice. It is possible
that, whether as a result of case law or through statute, changes in law or regulations, or their interpretation or
application, or administrative practice or tax treatment after the date of this Offering Memorandum, may result in either
the Issuer’s, Center Parcs’ or the Obligor Group’s debt financing arrangements as originally structured no longer having
the effect anticipated or which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s, Center Parcs’ or the Obligor Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations and/or could adversely affect the rights, priorities of payments
and/or treatment of holdings in Class B5 Notes of the holders of the Offered Notes.

**_The Offered Notes will be subject to restrictions on transfer, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at_**
**_which they may be sold._**

The Offered Notes have not been, nor will they be, registered under the securities laws of the United States or
elsewhere. The Offered Notes may not be publicly offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred in any jurisdiction
where registration may be required. In particular, sales and transfers of the Offered Notes are subject to restrictions
and/or certification requirements under the Securities Act as set forth in more detail under “Notice to Investors and
_Transfer Restrictions.” These restrictions may limit your ability to resell the Offered Notes. You should inform yourself_
of, and seek legal advice in relation to, applicable securities laws.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The estimated gross proceeds from the issuance of the Offered Notes will be £250,000,000.

Subject to the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer intends to make available to
the Borrowers on the Sixth Closing Date the Class B5 Facility and the Class B5 Loan will be advanced under the Class
B5 Facility.

On the Sixth Closing Date, the Borrowers and the Issuer intend to use £230,000,000 of the proceeds of the
Class B5 Loan to prepay a corresponding portion of the principal amount outstanding under the Class B3 Loan so as to
enable a redemption by the Issuer of a corresponding portion of the Class B3 Notes (but not including the payment of any
prepayment premium and accrued and unpaid interest). The remaining £20,000,000 of the proceeds of the Class B5 Loan
will be applied (i) towards general corporate purposes and (ii) to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the Transactions,
including the prepayment premium,.

On or about the Sixth Closing Date, the Issuer will redeem £230,000,000 of the aggregate principal amount of
the Class B3 Notes at a redemption price of 101.063% of the principal amount of such Class B3 Notes redeemed, which
is the redemption price applicable to the Class B3 Notes on or after 28 August 2020 but prior to 28 August 2021.
Proceeds of the Class B5 Loan in the amount of £230,000,000 will be used to prepay a corresponding portion of the
principal amount of the Class B3 Loan (but not including any prepayment premium and accrued and unpaid interest) so
as to enable a redemption by the Issuer of a corresponding portion of the Class B3 Notes. The payment of the prepayment
premium will be made from the remaining proceeds of the Class B5 Loan. The payment of the accrued and unpaid
interest up to the date of prepayment will be funded from other funds available to the Borrowers. The Issuer will apply
the proceeds of such prepayment to redeem, on a pro rata basis, a corresponding amount of the Class B3 Notes on or
about the Sixth Closing Date. The following table describes the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with
the Transactions as at the Sixth Closing Date. The actual amounts as compared with those set forth in the table and in the
accompanying footnotes are subject to adjustments and may differ at the date of completion of the Transactions
depending on several factors, including differences from the estimation of fees and expenses.

**CAPITALISATION**

The following table sets out the capitalisation of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and its subsidiaries as at
23 April 2020, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, including the application of the proceeds therefrom.

This table should be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial Information”, “Selected Consolidated
_Financial Information”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”,_
and Center Parcs’ audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

**Total capitalisation[(7)] ....................................................................................................** **1,572.4** **1,587.0**

(1) As adjusted cash and cash equivalents does not reflect the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Class B3 Notes expected to be redeemed on or
about the Sixth Closing Date, assuming £230,000,000 of Class B3 Notes are redeemed. As at 20 August 2020, cash on balance sheet was £119.2 million
(£102.2 million as at 16 July 2020).

(2) The amounts of the Class A2 Facility, Class A4 Facility, Class A5 Facility, Class B3 Facility, Class B4 Facility and Class B5 Facility do not reflect
unamortised deferred issue costs and also do not reflect accrued and unpaid interest, any prepayment fees or other charges expected to be owed under such
facilities.

(3) A prepayment premium of approximately £2.4 million in relation to the Class B3 Facility is due as part of the Refinancing, provided £230,000,000 of the
proceeds of the Class B5 Loan are used to repay a corresponding portion of the Class B3 Loan and redeem a corresponding part of the Class B3 Notes on
or about the Sixth Closing Date at a redemption price of 101.063% of the principal amount of Class B3 Notes redeemed.

(4) Unamortised deferred issue costs represent unamortised financing transaction costs to be recognised in the income statement over the remaining period of
the borrowing using the effective interest method. The increase in unamortised deferred issue costs of £1.8 million represents the estimated fees and
expenses of £3.0 million associated with the Transactions minus write-off of unamortised deferred issue costs of £1.2 million as at 23 April 2020 related to
the Class B3 Facility.

(5) On the Second Issue Date, the Issuer entered into the Liquidity Facility Agreement in order to enable the Issuer to service interest due on the Class A Notes
in the event of insufficient funds being received from the Obligors under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement to ensure that the Issuer meets its
interest payments due to the Class A Noteholders. On the Fourth Closing Date, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch transferred its commitments under the
Liquidity Facility Agreement to The Royal Bank of Scotland plc. As at 23 April 2020, the total commitments under the Liquidity Facility were
£90.0 million. The Liquidity Facility was undrawn as at the Sixth Closing Date. Total third party debt as adjusted for the Transactions does not include
£70 million received on 14 July 2020 under the Intercompany Account Advance. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions —
_Intercompany Account Agreement.”_

(6) The decrease in total equity reflects the write-off of £1.2 million (as at 23 April 2020) of unamortised deferred issue costs and a £2.4 million prepayment
premium (as at 23 April 2020) related to the Class B3 Facility, in each case in connection with the Transactions.

(7) Total capitalisation is defined as the sum of total third party debt and total equity.

**SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

_The selected historical financial information set forth below, for the periods indicated, is based on the audited_
_consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited as at and for each of the 52-week_
_periods ended 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 and the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, included elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum. The audit reports, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, express an unqualified_
_opinion for each of the respective periods and the audit report in relation to the financial statements as at and for the 52-_
_week period ended 23 April 2020 includes a material uncertainty paragraph related to going concern as set forth in Note_
_1 to such financial statements. The financial information as at 26 April 2018 has been derived from the comparative period_
_included in the audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019. The_
_selected historical financial information set forth below should be read in conjunction with Center Parcs (Holdings 1)_
_Limited’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and the_
_sections entitled “Presentation of Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations”. The information below is not necessarily indicative of the results of future_
_operations._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited early adopted IFRS 16 in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and_
_recognised £2.2 million as a reduction in retained earnings as a result of the adoption. Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited_
_early adopted IFRS 16 by applying the modified retrospective approach, which requires the cumulative effect of the initial_
_application of IFRS 16 to be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on 27 April 2018,_
_the date of initial application, without restating prior periods. On adoption, right of use assets and lease liabilities were_
_brought onto the balance sheet for £30.9 million and £33.1 million, respectively, and related depreciation charges and_
_finance expense are recognised in the income statement, instead of operating lease rentals expenses._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 15 in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 using the_
_retrospective method and restating the comparative periods. The effect of adoption of IFRS 15 as at 20 April 2017 was the_
_deferral of £0.8 million of revenue in respect of certain promotional activities that was recognised as a liability at the_
_transition date with a corresponding reduction to retained earnings._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 9 in the 52 weeks period ended 25 April 2019 and in_
_accordance with the standard, the comparative periods were not restated. The adoption of IFRS 9 on 27 April 2018 did_
_not have a material impact in the consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited._

_As a result of the adoption of the above accounting standards, the audited consolidated financial statements as_
_at and for each of the 52-week periods ended 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 are not directly comparable with the audited_
_consolidated financial statements as at and for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, included in this Offering_
_Memorandum. The audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018 were_
_prepared in accordance with IAS 18, Revenue, IAS 17, Leases and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and_
_Measurement, which were the standards applicable at that time._

(2) Exceptional and non-underlying items represented exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses of £2.2 million for the financial year ended
23 April 2020 represented £2.0 million in costs to exit a contract and £0.2 million of legal and other associated costs relating to the equity contribution
provided by the Brookfield Funds. Exceptional and non-underlying items for the financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented exceptional and nonunderlying administrative expenses of £1.6 million of costs relating to legal health and safety claims at Woburn Forest and associated settlements, together
with £0.7 million of one-off restructuring and reorganisation costs.

(3) Exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 represented the £6.1 million premium paid on the settlement of
Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes and £1.6 million in accelerated amortization of deferred issue costs in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class
A3 Notes. Exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses for the financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented the £26.9 million premium paid on the
settlement of Center Parcs’ Class B2 Notes.

(4) Exceptional and non-underlying taxation expense for the financial year ended 23 April 2020 represented the impact of the change in the applicable deferred
tax rate from 17% to 19%, which was partially offset by a taxation credit related to exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses. Exceptional and
non-underlying taxation income for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 represented a £1.5 million tax credit related to break costs and the accelerated
write-off of deferred fees in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes. Exceptional and non-underlying taxation income for the
financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented a £5.3 million tax credit in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class B3 Notes and a £1.9 million
tax credit in respect of a one-off adjustment to group relief relating to restricted interest deductions and subsequent increased capital allowances claims.

(1) Center Parcs adopted IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ starting on 27 April 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Center Parcs recognises a right-of-use asset
and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease
term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, Center Parcs recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the
leased asset are consumed.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**

**OPERATIONS**

_This discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based on, and should be read in conjunction_
_with, the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited as at and for_
_each of the 52-week periods ended 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019, and the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, included_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The audit reports, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, express an_
_unqualified opinion for each of the respective periods and the audit report in relation to the financial statements as at and_
_for the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020 includes a material uncertainty paragraph related to going concern as set_
_forth in Note 1 to such financial statements._ _The financial information as at 26 April 2018 has been derived from the_
_comparative period included in the audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the 52-week periods ended 25_
_April 2019. See also “Selected Consolidated Financial Information” and “Presentation of Financial Information”._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited early adopted IFRS 16 in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and_
_recognised £2.2 million as a reduction in retained earnings as a result of the adoption. Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited_
_early adopted IFRS 16 by applying the modified retrospective approach, which requires the cumulative effect of the initial_
_application of IFRS 16 to be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on 27 April 2018,_
_the date of initial application, without restating prior periods. On adoption, right of use assets and lease liabilities were_
_brought onto the balance sheet for £30.9 million and £33.1 million, respectively, and related depreciation charges and_
_finance expense are recognised in the income statement, instead of operating lease rentals expenses._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 15 in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 using the_
_retrospective method and restating the comparative periods. The effect of adoption of IFRS 15 as at 20 April 2017 was the_
_deferral of £0.8 million of revenue in respect of certain promotional activities that was recognised as a liability at the_
_transition date with a corresponding reduction to retained earnings._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 9 in the 52 weeks period ended 25 April 2019 and in_
_accordance with the standard, the comparative periods were not restated. The adoption of IFRS 9 on 27 April 2018 did_
_not have a material impact in the consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited._

_As a result of the adoption of the above accounting standards and the additional week included in the 53-week_
_period ended 26 April 2018, the audited consolidated financial statements as at and for each of the 52-week periods ended_
_23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 are not directly comparable with the audited consolidated financial statements as at and_
_for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, included in this Offering Memorandum. The audited consolidated financial_
_statements as at and for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018 were prepared in accordance with IAS 18, Revenue, IAS_
_17, Leases and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, which were the standards applicable at that_
_time._

_During the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020, the Center Parcs villages were closed from 20 March 2020 to_
_the end of the period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to facilitate comparability to the 52-week period ended_
_25 April 2019 and the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, certain financial and operational information is presented as_
_of and for the 52-week period from 1 March 2019 to 27 February 2020, which represents the last 52-week period for which_
_management accounts are available and during which all villages were open and operational. Figures for the 52 week_
_period from 1 March 2019 to 27 February 2020 are calculated by adding together the results from the 52-week period_
_ended 25 April 2019 to the results from 26 April 2019 to 27 February 2020 and deducting the results from 27 April 2018_
_to 28 February 2019. In addition, certain comparative figures are also presented as of and for the 52-week period from_
_2 March 2018 to 28 February 2019. These comparative figures are calculated by adding together the results from the 53-_
_week period ended 26 April 2018 to the results from 27 April 2018 to 28 February 2019 and deducting the results from_
_21 April 2017 to 22 February 2018 and the 53-week Adjustment._ _The financial information for the 52-week periods ended_
_27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019 has been extracted from management accounts. The financial information for_
_the 52-week periods ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019 has not been prepared in accordance with IAS 34_
_Interim Financial Reporting and has not been audited or reviewed. Moreover, as certain year-end procedures were not_
_performed in preparing the financial information for the 52-week periods ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019,_

**OVERVIEW**

Center Parcs is a leading UK short-break holiday business, attracting over 2.1 million guests in the 52-week period
ended 27 February 2020. Center Parcs operates five specially constructed holiday villages in the United Kingdom:
Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Elveden Forest in Suffolk, Whinfell Forest in Cumbria
(the “Original Villages”) and Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire. Each village is set in a forest environment amongst
approximately 400 acres of forest around a lake and is open 365 days per year.

Woodland, water and a natural environment make up the essential environment of a Center Parcs break. Within
this comfortable, quiet, car-free and family-friendly setting, each of the Center Parcs villages provides guests with high
quality accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. In total, as of 28 August 2020, there were 4,335 units
of accommodation across its five villages, which could accommodate approximately 22,958 guests per day at 100%
occupancy. The focal point and key attraction of each village is an all-weather indoor sub-tropical swimming paradise,
featuring a selection of water activities including a wave pool, river slides and rides, children’s pools and Jacuzzis. Center
Parcs’ on-site experiences also include outdoor activities such as cycling, boating and zip wires; indoor activities such as
ten-pin bowling, badminton and pottery; and amenities such as spas, food and beverage and retail. A significant proportion
of Center Parcs’ revenue is generated from guests’ on-site spending, including for leisure and spa activities, food and
beverage and retail, representing 39.2% of total revenue in financial year 2020.

Center Parcs has a well-established brand in the UK, renowned for providing high quality experiences and
facilities, targeting a primary guest base of affluent families. Center Parcs benefits from strong guest loyalty with
approximately 34% of guests returning within 14 months and approximately 54% returning over a five-year period. In
addition, Center Parcs believes that its business model is difficult to replicate due to the lack of suitable locations for the
development of holiday parks and high development costs while Center Parcs is well positioned to continue to grow its
business.

Center Parcs’ villages typically draw on a regional population of guests who are attracted to the convenience of
being within a relatively short driving distance from home. Over 90% of the UK population lives within a 2.5 hour drive
of at least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two hour drive of the village
they choose to visit. Center Parcs believes that the proximity of the majority of guests to its villages combined with the
easy accessibility of the villages by car make Center Parcs a popular and convenient short break holiday option. Occupancy
levels at Center Parcs’ villages have been consistently high: 97.6% in financial year 2018, 97.1% in financial year 2019,
and 97.3% in the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. Occupancy levels have averaged approximately 96% in the last
15 years to 27 February 2020, and approximately 97% in the last eight years to 27 February 2020, despite the expansion
of existing accommodation offerings at Center Parcs’ Original Villages and the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014.

For the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, Center Parcs had revenue of £496.3 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of £239.4 million, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.2%.

**KEY FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

**The COVID-19 pandemic**

The COVID-19 pandemic and government efforts to contain it have severely impacted the travel and hospitality
industry in the United Kingdom, including Center Parcs. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs closed all
of its villages to guests from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020. The closure of the villages resulted in no revenue being
recorded from holidays that would have taken place during that period, which included periods such as Easter holidays and
May half-term which have historically been very profitable. In addition, Center Parcs offered guests who had booked
holidays for the closure period the option of a refund for their holiday or postponing their break to later dates, with a £100
financial incentive offered to guests choosing to postpone. A majority of guests sought refunds for their break, amounting
to approximately £62 million in refunds to affected guests as of 15 July 2020, which resulted in an adverse impact to Center
Parcs’ liquidity and cash flow.

Brookfield has, throughout this period, demonstrated its ongoing support and commitment to Center Parcs’
business. Brookfield (through its subsidiary, BSREP II Center Parcs Jersey Ltd.) supported the Center Parcs Group, which
is one of the largest investments in the BSREP II fund, with equity contributions of £41.5 million in April 2020 and £27.5
million in May 2020. On 14 July 2020, the Brookfield Funds provided the Intercompany Account Advance of £70 million
to CP Opco to continue to support Center Parcs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the closure of Center Parcs’ villages, Center Parcs implemented strict cash management procedures to
conserve liquidity, including the re-phasing of capital investment projects and cessation of non-essential operating
activities. Center Parcs reduced capital expenditure by ceasing activity on approximately 90% of active capital investment
projects during the closure. In addition, Center Parcs also participated in a number of UK government support measures
for businesses to reduce the impact of the closures on its liquidity. In particular, Center Parcs deferred VAT payments and

83


-----

furloughed approximately 90% of its employees in accordance with the UK government’s CJRS from 27 March 2020 to
3 July 2020. As at 4 September 2020, less than 1% of Center Parcs’ employees remained on furlough following the reopening of the villages. Center Parcs also utilised the 12-month business rates holiday available to retail, hospitality and
leisure businesses.

Together, these actions reduced operating expenses by approximately £14 million on average per four-week
period, or approximately 70%, to approximately £6 million on average per four-week period from 24 April 2020 to
18 June 2020, compared to approximately £20 million on average per four-week period from 26 April 2019 to
27 February 2020. Center Parcs incurred cost of sales of £4.8 million and administrative expenses of £6.2 million in the
period from 20 March 2020 to 23 April 2020.

Since reopening on 13 July 2020, Center Parcs has implemented significant operational changes in accordance
with government health and safety regulations. Center Parcs’ villages are operating at reduced capacity levels appropriate
to ensure proper application of government requirements and Center Parcs has implemented an enhanced cleaning regime
throughout the villages. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, a small number of Center Parcs’ leisure activities
remain unavailable to guests. Center Parcs continues to review and amend its operating procedures, prioritising guest and
employee safety. These operational changes may result in additional operating expenses. In addition, some guests may
choose to cancel their holidays if features and amenities remain closed, which would result in an adverse impact on
revenues and cash flow. Due to the closure of certain features and amenities, Center Parcs currently offers guests the
options of a free change of dates or a full refund for guests who choose to cancel their breaks.

While consumer sentiment on leisure travel in light of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be predicted, Center
Parcs believes it may be relatively well-positioned to benefit from pent-up demand. Most guests travel in their own cars to
and from the villages, the lodges provide for self-catering, the spacing between lodges and large open footprint of the
villages lends itself well to social distancing and many of the activities are outdoors, benefiting from the forest environment.
In addition, restrictions on international travel may further increase demand for Center Parcs’ villages. As at
21 August 2020, forward bookings for the third quarter and fourth quarter of financial year 2021 (including bookings that
have been moved with a financial incentive from the COVID-19 closure period) were approximately 1% and 9% higher,
respectively, than forward bookings at the same point during financial year 2020. Moreover, customer demand is already
exceeding expected operating capacity for some breaks. Further, approximately 35% of guests who had booked breaks
during the period of closure due to COVID-19 postponed rather than canceled their breaks. However, despite expected
resilience in short-term demand, Center Parcs expects occupancy and RevPAL to decline in financial year 2021 as
compared to financial year 2020 due to the closure period and reduced capacity after reopening.

The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Center Parcs’ business is dependent on several factors,
including the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK’s economic recovery, domestic travel demand, and
evolving customer expectations. A second outbreak of COVID-19, continuing depressed economic conditions or travel
demand, or new health and safety regulations could also result in an adverse impact on Center Parcs’ results may be
affected. In addition, a localised outbreak of COVID-19 at any of Center Parcs’ villages or elsewhere in the UK could
result in further closures, litigation, restrictions on guests’ ability to travel and affect guest and employee confidence. Center
Parcs may not be able to efficiently manage its operating expenses and liquidity in case of a second COVID-19 outbreak
or a localized outbreak, including due to a lack of availability of government support programmes and an inability to
furlough employees for shorter durations of closure.

**Economic conditions in the United Kingdom**

While Center Parcs has performed resiliently during both downturns and recoveries, which has resulted in Center
Parcs’ occupancy levels averaging approximately 96% in the last 15 years to 27 February 2020 and approximately 97% in
the last eight years to 27 February 2020, demand for its products and services is sensitive to disposable income levels and
holiday length and destination preferences of its guests, which are linked to general economic conditions in the United
Kingdom. The UK economy entered into a recession in the first half of 2020, with gross domestic product decreasing by
2.2% from January to March 2020 and decreasing by a further 20.4% between April and June 2020. Weak economic
conditions, whether as a result of COVID-19, Brexit or otherwise, may result in a decline in the number of guests and a
decrease in on-site spending. However, such economic conditions in the United Kingdom or a weaker exchange rate of the
pound sterling against currencies such as the euro and US dollar may result in more British families opting to take domestic
holidays in the United Kingdom, instead of traveling overseas, which could result in Center Parcs’ villages being more
attractive to such families.

**Seasonality**

Center Parcs’ operations are subject to seasonal factors, as pricing varies significantly depending on the time of
year. Center Parcs’ prices are highest during peak demand periods, which include the main holiday periods at Easter, the
summer holidays and the Christmas/New Year period, along with school half terms. Center Parcs’ revenues and operating
costs are therefore also typically highest during such peak demand periods. Occupancy rates, however, remain relatively

84


-----

unchanged throughout the year, as Center Parcs’ online dynamic pricing encourages demand outside of the peak periods.
Ahead of the peak demand periods, the peak booking season occurs in late December to late February, and Center Parcs
plans a significant concentration of its marketing campaigns around this time.

**Revenue and other key performance indicators**

**_Revenue_**

Center Parcs’ revenue is principally comprised of accommodation revenue generated from holidays at Center
Parcs’ accommodation, and on-site revenue, comprised of amounts received predominantly from the sale of food and
beverages, retail items, leisure activities and spa-related activities. The combined total of accommodation and on-site
revenue is a key indicator of the overall performance of the business. Accommodation revenue is recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the holiday, and on-site revenue is recognised at the point the guest undertakes the relevant
activity or receives the relevant service.

Revenue for financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020 was £469.0 million, £480.2 million and £443.7 million,
respectively. Revenue for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020 was £496.3 million as compared to £475.3 million
for the 52-week period ended 28 February 2019. The proportional contribution of each of the villages to revenue in the 52week periods ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019 was broadly consistent with their contribution to revenue in
financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Advance payments for accommodation and pre-booked activities are recorded as payments on account within
trade and other payables until the holiday commences. Revenues are primarily driven by occupancy levels and pricing.

**_Occupancy_**

Center Parcs measures occupancy as the average number of units of accommodation occupied as a percentage
of the total number of units of accommodation available, including those units that are off-line for refurbishment.

Occupancy is a key driver of both accommodation and on-site revenue. Higher levels of occupancy generally
result in greater volumes of on-site purchases, reflecting the increased number of guests. Center Parcs’ business is generally
characterised by high occupancy rates, and achieved occupancy rates of 97.6%, 97.1% and 88.0% in the financial years
2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and 97.2% and 97.3% for the 52-week periods ended 28 February 2019 and 27 February
2020, respectively. The high occupancy rates in financial years 2018 and 2019 and the 52-week periods ended 28 February
2019 and 27 February 2020 were achieved despite approximately 1.5%, 1.3%, 1.2% and 1.5% of Center Parcs’
accommodation being offline due to upgrades and refurbishments in the respective periods. The lower occupancy level for
financial year 2020 reflects the impact of the closure of the villages due to COVID-19 from 20 March 2020 to the end of
the financial year.

**_Average Daily Rate_**

One of the key performance indicators Center Parcs uses to help measure and maximise its yield is ADR which
is calculated as the average rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total accommodation income for the period divided
by the total number of accommodation nights sold. Due to yield management adjustments, ADR can vary substantially
between low and peak periods. See “— Seasonality”.

ADR for the financial year 2020 was £194.91, compared with £191.74 and £184.95 for financial years 2019 and
2018, respectively. ADR for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020 was £197.76, compared with £189.72 for the 52week period ended 28 February 2019.

Improvements in ADR have primarily reflected inflationary price increases, improved mix of accommodation
following refurbishment upgrades and new build projects (resulting in an increased amount of higher quality
accommodation) as well as yield management improvements. From financial year 2012 through financial year 2020, ADR
grew at a CAGR of 4.3%, in part due to refurbishments and a slightly higher proportion of premium executive
accommodation, as well as the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014.

**_RevPAL_**

RevPAL is the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on the total accommodation income divided
by the total available number of accommodation nights. RevPAL can also be calculated as ADR multiplied by occupancy.

RevPAL for the financial year 2020 was £171.54, compared with £186.08 and £180.46 for financial years 2019
and 2018, respectively. RevPAL for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020 was £192.43, compared with £184.35 for
the 52-week period ended 28 February 2019.

85


-----

The scale of the increases in RevPAL over the years primarily reflects those factors discussed for ADR above.
Center Parcs’ management believes RevPAL to be a meaningful indicator of performance as RevPAL takes into account
both occupancy and ADR. The lower RevPAL for financial year 2020 reflects the impact of the COVID-19 closures on
occupancy.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

As presented herein, this measure reflects an adjustment to EBITDA by removing the effect of certain
exceptional and non-underlying items which management believes are not indicative of Center Parcs’ underlying operating
performance. See “Presentation of Financial Information”. Adjusted EBITDA for financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020
was £228.4 million, £232.6 million and £200.0 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA for the 52-week period ended
27 February 2020 was £239.4 million as compared to £230.8 million for the 52-week period ended 28 February 2019. The
proportional contribution of each of the villages to Adjusted EBITDA in the 52-week periods ended 27 February 2020 and
28 February 2019 was broadly consistent with their contribution to Adjusted EBITDA in financial years 2018, 2019 and
2020

**_Yield Management and Pricing_**

Center Parcs applies “yield management” strategies to maximise revenue levels throughout the year. It actively
adjusts its pricing throughout the 104 available three and four day “breaks” in each year to reflect the seasonal and other
fluctuations in demand. Center Parcs uses ADR and RevPAL to measure its yield management. It has a dedicated pricing
team that monitors advance bookings and adjusts prices for accommodation during the year according to expected guest
demand. The yield management strategies have achieved high occupancy rates as in the last 15 years to 27 February 2020,
Center Parcs’ occupancy rates have averaged approximately 96.2%.

Unlike accommodation prices, on-site prices generally fluctuate less throughout the year and are less seasonal
as these prices have not been subject to similar levels of pricing and yield management as accommodation prices. On-site
prices are also reviewed and increased to reflect inflation.

**_Advance bookings_**

Center Parcs places a strong emphasis on advance bookings, with an average of 19 weeks’ booking-to-arrival
time in financial years 2018 to 2020 (excluding the closure period due to COVID-19), which results in significant revenue
and cash flow visibility. Advance bookings measures the percentage of accommodation available during a financial year
that have been booked at the beginning of that financial year.

Center Parcs holidays are available for booking starting from either 15 months or 18 months in advance of the
scheduled stay date, depending on when in the year the booking is made. Center Parcs collects 30% of the accommodation
cost at the time of booking if the booking is made more than ten weeks in advance of the holiday, with the balance of the
cost collected ten weeks prior to the start of the break that has been booked. If a guest books less than ten weeks prior to
the arrival date, the accommodation cost is payable in full on booking and cannot be refunded upon cancellation. Certain
short-term changes to the payment terms have been made during the period of closure and the period immediately following
reopening due to COVID-19 to reflect current circumstances. Center Parcs expects to revert to the previous terms in the
near future. Leisure activities available at the villages can be pre-booked and pre-paid prior to arrival. Guests can only prebook leisure activities if they pre-pay and in such cases a cancellation policy applies. Leisure activities cancelled up to 72
hours before the activity start time will receive a full refund. If the cancellation is made less than 72 hours before the
activity start time, a 50% cancellation charge will apply. If the cancellation is made less than 10 hours before the activity
start time, a 100% cancellation charge will apply and no refunds will be made.

For each of the financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, an average of approximately 43% of the available
accommodation nights had been booked by the beginning of that financial year. For the financial years 2018, 2019 and
2020, over 60% of leisure and spa activities were pre-booked and pre-paid prior to arrival.

**_Cost of sales and overheads_**

Center Parcs’ principal operating costs are cost of sales, village overheads and central overheads. In addition,
Center Parcs benefits from having a flexible cost base, as demonstrated by its ability to manage its operating expenses
during the COVID-19 closure period. For the purposes of its audited consolidated financial statements, village overheads

and central overheads are treated as ‘administrative expenses before exceptional and non-underlying items’. The following
table sets forth total cost of sales and overheads before exceptional and non-underlying items for the periods indicated:

**Total cost of sales and overheads before exceptional items ........** **(240.6)[)]** **(247.6)** **(243.7)[(1)]**

(1) Staff costs, included in cost of sales and overheads before exceptional and non-underlying items, are stated net of £5.7 million in respect of the
CJRS.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales represents variable direct expenses incurred from revenue-generating activities, primarily expenses
of food and beverages and retail merchandise and associated payroll costs. These costs generally vary with changes in
revenue, as well as inflation and commodity prices. Center Parcs continually evaluates and renegotiates supply agreements
centrally and aims to apply best practices, such as improving the supplier tender process, taking advantage of promotional
offers and re-negotiating key costs in a timely manner, throughout the group.

Center Parcs utilises visibility of forward bookings to optimise the efficiency of personnel across the village by
matching staffing levels to expected demand in various areas of its business.

**_Village Overheads_**

The primary components of village overheads are set forth in the table below:

**53 weeks ended** **52 weeks ended** **52 weeks ended**

**26 April 2018** **25 April 2019** **23 April 2020**

**£m**
**Village overheads**
Personnel costs................................................................................. 30.9 32.0 28.6
Maintenance costs ............................................................................ 10.6 10.8 10.5
Energy costs ..................................................................................... 12.6 13.0 13.8
Insurance/rent/rates .......................................................................... 26.3 25.5 25.3
Other costs ....................................................................................... 11.7 11.3 14.1

**Total ................................................................................................** **92.1** **92.6** **92.3**

The largest cost within village overheads is in respect of personnel costs, which are subject to annual pay
increases as well as to increases arising from legislative and regulatory changes, which include the introduction of the
National Living Wage in April 2016 and subsequent increases to the National Living Wage.

Center Parcs seeks to manage other village overheads through actively managing costs by benchmarking each
of its villages against each other in order to strive to achieve “best in class”.

**_Central Overheads_**

The primary components of central overheads are set forth in the table below:

**53 weeks ended** **52 weeks ended** **52 weeks ended**

**26 April 2018** **25 April 2019** **23 April 2020**

**£m**
**Central overheads**
Personnel costs................................................................................. 12.4 13.0 12.5
Marketing costs ................................................................................ 10.2 12.0 9.7
Other costs ....................................................................................... 2.2 0.9 2.0

**Total ................................................................................................** **24.8** **25.9** **24.2**

Marketing costs are primarily incurred in connection with marketing and advertising campaigns through all
media channels. Center Parcs seeks to manage the cost of its marketing campaigns through the use of cost-efficient
marketing channels such as internet advertising and targeted emails to contacts in its guest database. Marketing campaigns

are planned annually with a significant concentration around the peak booking season of late December to late February.
During the closure of Center Parcs’ villages due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs significantly reduced its
marketing expenditure.

Other costs relates to all other central costs and includes, among other things, credit card charges and IT costs,
less rebates received by Center Parcs from its suppliers.

**Depreciation and Amortisation**

Depreciation and amortisation is comprised of depreciation of leasehold improvements, installations, fixtures
and fittings and motor vehicles and hardware, and amortisation of software and other intangible assets. Depreciation for
financial year 2020 was £53.6 million, compared with £50.7 million and £47.6 million for financial years 2019 and 2018,
respectively. Amortisation of intangible assets for financial year 2020 was £7.2 million, compared with £7.0 million and
£5.1 million for financial years 2019 and 2018, respectively.

**Debt and financing costs**

Finance costs comprise interest paid on outstanding debt and loans, primarily in respect of the Class A Loans,
the Class B Loans and the head office mortgage, together with the amortisation over the life of the secured bonds of deferred
costs incurred in the raising of finance.

**Adoption of IFRS 16**

Under IFRS 16, Center Parcs was required to change the way it accounted for leases previously classified as
operating leases under IAS 17 ‘Leases’, which were off-balance-sheet. Center Parcs adopted IFRS 16 on 27 April 2018,
using the modified retrospective approach and therefore has not restated figures previously reported under IAS 17 ‘Leases.’

Adoption of IFRS 16 has resulted in certain figures presented in this Offering Memorandum in the financial
years 2020 and 2019, respectively, not being directly comparable with figures reported in similar line items as at prior
reporting dates or for prior reporting periods and the addition of certain new line items. See notes 1, 2 and 16 from Center
Parcs’ audited financial statements for the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and Notes 11 and 16 from Center Parcs’
audited financial statements for the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020.

**_Impact of IFRS 16 on Retained Earnings_**


The impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 on retained earnings was as follows:


**£m**


Recognition of right-of-use assets .................................................................................................................... 30.9
Recognition of lease liabilities .......................................................................................................................... (33.1)
Elimination of rent prepayments ....................................................................................................................... (0.4)
Recognition of associated deferred tax ............................................................................................................. 0.4

**Reduction in retained earnings as at 26 April 2018 .....................................................................................** **(2.2)**

**_Impact of IFRS 16 on Adjusted EBITDA_**

Under IFRS 16, leased assets and the associated lease liabilities are held on the balance sheet. Depreciation is
recognised on the right-of-use assets and interest expense is recognised on the lease liabilities. IFRS 16 therefore resulted
in removing higher depreciation and interest expense charges from the profit for the period attributable to equity
shareholders, to arrive to Adjusted EBITDA in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019, when compared to the 53-week
period ended 26 April 2018. In the financial statements for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, lease payments on

-----

the Longleat and Woburn village sites were treated as an administrative expense of £1.4 million and included within
Adjusted EBITDA.

(1) Exceptional and non-underlying items represented exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses of £2.2 million for the financial year ended
23 April 2020 represented £2.0 million in costs to exit a contract and £0.2 million of legal and other associated costs relating to the equity contribution
provided by the Brookfield Funds. Exceptional and non-underlying items for the financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented exceptional and nonunderlying administrative expenses £1.6 million of costs relating to legal health and safety claims at Woburn Forest and associated settlements, together with
£0.7 million of one-off restructuring and reorganisation costs.

(2) Exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 represented the £6.1 million premium paid on the settlement of
Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes and £1.6 million in accelerated amortisation of deferred issue costs in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class
A3 Notes. Exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses for the financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented the £26.9 million premium paid on the
settlement of Center Parcs’ Class B2 Notes.

(3) Exceptional and non-underlying taxation expense for the financial year ended 23 April 2020 represented the impact of the change in the applicable deferred
tax rate from 17% to 19%, which was partially offset by a taxation credit related to exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses. Exceptional and
non-underlying taxation income for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 represented a £1.5 million tax credit related to break costs and the accelerated
write-off of deferred fees in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes. Exceptional and non-underlying taxation income for the
financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented a £5.3 million tax credit in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class B3 Notes and a £1.9 million
tax credit in respect of a one-off adjustment to group relief relating to restricted interest deductions and subsequent increased capital allowances claims.

(1) From 20 March 2020 to 23 April 2020, all five of Center Parcs’ villages were closed to guests as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and Center Parcs
recorded no revenue during this period.

**Financial Year 2020 compared with Financial Year 2019**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue decreased by £36.5 million, or 7.6%, during the financial year ended 23 April 2020 to £443.7 million,
compared to £480.2 million in the financial year ended 25 April 2019. This decrease was primarily a result of the closure
of Center Parcs’ villages from 20 March 2020 to 23 April 2020 due to COVID-19 as £0 of revenue was recognised during
this closure period.

The number of units of accommodation as at 23 April 2020 was 4,323 compared to 4,317 as at 25 April 2019.
The increase in number of units reflects the construction of six new lodges at Woburn.

Occupancy decreased from 97.1% in the financial year ended 25 April 2019 to 88.0% during the financial year
ended 23 April 2020 due to the impact of the closure of Center Parcs’ villages from 20 March 2020 to 23 April 2020 due
to COVID-19.

ADR growth continued at all five villages and overall ADR increased by 1.7% to £194.91 in the financial year
ended 23 April 2020 compared to the financial year ended 25 April 2019, primarily due to refurbishments of existing lodges
and yield management but adversely affected by the closure of the villages in the financial year ended 23 April 2020 during
the historically higher ADR Easter holiday period. This increase in ADR was offset by the lower occupancy resulting in
RevPAL of £171.54 (2019: £186.08) in the financial year ended 23 April 2020.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales decreased to £127.2 million in the financial year ended 23 April 2020 from £129.1 million in the
financial year ended 25 April 2019, primarily due to limited cost of sales incurred from 20 March 2020 to 23 April 2020
when Center Parcs’ villages were closed due to COVID-19, which was partially offset by increases in the National Living
Wage. As a percentage of revenue, cost of sales increased to 28.7% in the financial year ended 23 April 2020 from 26.9%
in the financial year ended 25 April 2019 as Center Parcs continued to incur certain costs necessary to maintain the sites in
a safe-and-secure condition, including payroll costs (net of the payroll costs reimbursable under the UK CJRS).

**_Administrative expenses before exceptional and non-underlying items_**

Administrative expenses before exceptional and non-underlying items decreased to £116.5 million in the
financial year ended 23 April 2020 from £118.5 million in the financial year ended 25 April 2019, primarily due to the
closure of Center Parcs’ villages due to COVID-19 from 20 March 2020 to 23 April 2020. During the closure period,
Center Parcs continued to incur energy and maintenance costs as well as certain payroll costs, resulting in a more limited
impact on administrative expenses before exceptional and non-underlying items than on revenue.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

As a result of the factors described above, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by £32.6 million, or 14.0%, in the
financial year ended 23 April 2020 as compared to the financial year ended 25 April 2019.

**_Exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses_**

Exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses were £2.2 million for the financial year ended 23 April
2020 and related to the exit of a supplier contract and legal and other associated costs in respect of the equity contribution
from the Brookfield Funds. No exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses were recognised in the financial
year ended 25 April 2019.

**_Depreciation and amortisation_**

Depreciation and amortisation for the financial year ended 23 April 2020 was £60.8 million, an increase of
£3.1 million compared to the financial year ended 25 April 2019. This increase was primarily due to the Group’s ongoing
capital investment resulting in a larger asset base. The increase in depreciation and amortisation primarily related to an
increase in depreciation of property, plant and equipment – owned assets from £50.1 million in the financial year ended 25
April 2019 to £53.0 million in the financial year ended 23 April 2020.

**_Finance costs and income_**

For financial year 2020, the annual interest payable on Center Parcs’ secured debt was £90.6 million with all
tranches of secured debt having a fixed rate of interest.

Finance costs in the financial year ended 23 April 2020 represent primarily interest payable on secured debt and
the amortisation of associated deferred issue costs. Finance costs in the financial year ended 25 April 2019 also included
£7.7 million in exceptional and non-underlying costs related to the refinancing of Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes, including
(i) £6.1 million in connection with the premium paid on settlement of the Class A3 Notes and (ii) £1.6 million in connection
with accelerated amortisation of deferred issue costs.

Finance income represents bank interest receivable and amounted to £0.3 million for the financial year ended
23 April 2020 as compared to £0.2 million for the financial year ended 25 April 2019.

**_Taxation_**

Taxation before exceptional and non-underlying items changed from a tax expense of £15.2 million in the
financial year ended 25 April 2019 to a tax expense of £9.7 million in the financial year ended 23 April 2020. Exceptional
and non-underlying tax expenses of £10.3 million were recognised in the financial year ended 23 April 2020, primarily in
relation to the change in the applicable deferred tax rate from 17% to 19%, as compared to exceptional and non-underlying
tax income of £1.5 million in the financial year ended 25 April 2019. Corporation tax of £13.1 million was paid during the
financial year ended 23 April 2020 compared with £3.1 million in the financial year ended 25 April 2019 and made
payments for taxation group relief of £0.4 million in the financial year ended 23 April 2020 compared with £10.9 million
in the financial year ended 25 April 2019.

**_Profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders_**

As a result of the factors described above, profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders decreased by
£39.8 million, or 63.4%, in the financial year ended 23 April 2020 as compared to the financial year ended 25 April 2019.

**Financial Year 2019 compared with Financial Year 2018**

**_Revenue_**

Center Parcs revenue for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 increased by £11.2 million, or 2.4%, to
£480.2 million reflecting growth in accommodation revenue of 3.8% and on-site revenue of 0.3% compared to the financial
year ended 26 April 2018, offset by the fact that the financial year ended 25 April 2019 had 52 weeks whereas the financial
year ended 26 April 2018 had 53 weeks. Center Parcs experienced broadly consistent underlying revenue growth at all five
villages.

Center Parcs’ occupancy remained strong at 97.1% in the financial year ended 25 April 2019, a slight decrease
of 0.5% from 97.6% in the financial year ended 26 April 2018. The number of units of accommodation increased to 4,317
as at 25 April 2019 compared to 4,227 as at 26 April 2018, reflecting the construction of 90 new units of accommodation
during the financial year ended 25 April 2019, including 51 one-bedroom apartments at Elveden Forest. ADR increased to
£191.74 in the financial year ended 25 April 2019, an increase of 3.7% from £184.95 in the financial year ended 26 April

91


-----

2018. The ADR growth and high occupancy levels drove an increase in RevPAL to £186.08 in financial year 2019, an
increase of 3.1%, from £180.46 in the financial year ended 26 April 2018.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales increased to £129.1 million in the financial year ended 25 April 2019 from £123.7 million in the
financial year ended 26 April 2018, in line with the growth in on-site revenue and the impact of the increases in national

financial year ended 25 April 2019 from £116.9 million in the financial year ended 26 April 2018.

Exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses of £2.3 million in the financial year ended 26 April
2018 represented £1.6 million of costs relating to legal claims and associated settlements, together with £0.7 million of
one-off restructuring and reorganisation costs.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

As a result of the factors described above, Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended 25 April 2019
increased by £4.2 million or 1.8% in comparison to the prior year.

**_Depreciation and amortisation_**

Depreciation and amortisation for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 was £57.7 million, an increase of
£5.0 million, or 9.5%, compared to depreciation and amortisation for the financial year ended 26 April 2018. This increase
reflected Center Parcs’ capital investment programme which resulted in a larger asset base, including depreciation resulting
from capital expenditures during the financial year ended 26 April 2018.

**_Finance costs and income_**

With effect from 20 November 2018, when Center Parcs issued £100.0 million of additional Class A4 Notes
and £379.5 million of new Class A5 Notes, annual interest payable on the Group’s secured debt was £90.6 million. All
tranches of secured debt attract a fixed rate of interest.

Finance costs in the period under review principally represent interest on secured debt and interest on related
party loans. Interest on related party loans is not cash-settled.

On 20 November 2018, when Center Parcs issued £100.0 million of additional Class A4 Notes and £379.5
million of new Class A5 Notes. Part of the proceeds was used to settle £350.0 million of Class A3 Notes that had an
expected maturity date of 28 February 2020. Make-whole costs of £6.1 million in respect of the settlement of the Class A3
Notes were recognised as an exceptional and non-underlying finance expense, as discussed above, together with
£1.6 million of accelerated amortisation of deferred issue costs in respect of the Class A3 Notes.

Exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses in the financial year ended 25 April 2019 included
£7.7 million in exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses, of which £6.1 million represented the premium paid on
the settlement of Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes and £1.6 million represented accelerated amortization of deferred issue
costs in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes.

Exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses in the financial year ended 26 April 2018 included £26.9
million in exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses, representing the premium paid on the settlement of Center
Parcs’ Class B2 Notes.

**_Taxation_**

**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**

Center Parcs’ principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditure and debt service. Center Parcs
has historically funded operations and capital expenditure with cash flow from operations. As at 23 April 2020, Center
Parcs had cash and cash equivalents of £36.4 million (£119.2 million as at 20 August 2020), and negative working capital
of £112.4 million. Working capital is defined as the net value of Center Parcs’ inventories, trade and other receivables and
current trade and other payables (excluding taxation creditors and capital and interest accruals).

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs closed its villages from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020.
Center Parcs implemented strict cash management procedures to conserve liquidity, including the re-phasing of capital
investment projects and cessation of non-essential operating activities. During this period, Center Parcs ceased
approximately 90% of active capital expenditure projects. Center Parcs also deferred corporation tax payments and VAT
payments and furloughed approximately 90% of its employees in accordance with the UK government’s CJRS from
27 March 2020 to 3 July 2020. Together, these actions reduced operating expenses by approximately £14 million on
average per four-week period, or approximately 70%, to approximately £6 million on average per four-week period from
24 April 2020 to 18 June 2020, compared to approximately £20 million on average per four-week period from
26 April 2019 to 27 February 2020.

Center Parcs further strengthened its liquidity position by equity contributions from the Brookfield Funds of
£69 million, comprising £41.5 million received in April 2020 and £27.5 million received in May 2020, and the
Intercompany Account Advance of £70 million received on 14 July 2020 from the Brookfield Funds. Center Parcs also has
access to a £90 million undrawn committed liquidity facility, which is available to pay certain senior expenses and interest
on Class A Notes. As at 23 April 2020, Center Parcs had £36.4 million in cash and cash equivalents.

Following the reopening of the villages on 13 July 2020, Center Parcs’ villages initially operated at
approximately 65% capacity, which was increased to 75% capacity on 7 September 2020. Capacity levels will be reviewed
in due course pursuant to government guidelines and health and safety considerations.

The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic creates material uncertainty in Center Parcs’ ability to
predict future liquidity requirements. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Center Parcs’ Business and Industry—As a
_result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is material uncertainty about Center Parcs’ ability to continue as a_
_going concern” and Note 1 to the 2020 Audited Financial Statements. Should a subsequent wave of COVID-19 require a_
future closure of Center Parcs villages, Center Parcs anticipates that it will be able to meet its working capital requirements
for approximately four months without sourcing additional funding.

Center Parcs may, from time to time, seek other sources of funding, which may include debt or equity financings
depending on its financing needs and market conditions.

The maturity profile of Center Parcs’ existing borrowings as at 23 April 2020 was as follows:

**Less than one** **One to five** **Greater than** **Deferred**

Net cash from operating activities was £237.3 million, £225.2 million and £151.2 million in financial years
2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The primary reason for the decrease of £12.1 million, or 5.1%, in cash flows from
operating activities for financial year 2019 as compared with financial year 2018 was an increase in corporation tax paid
and payments for taxation group relief. The primary reason for the decrease in net cash from operating activities of
£74.0 million, or 32.9%, for financial year 2020 as compared with financial year 2019 was the closure of Center Parcs’
villages due to COVID-19 from 20 March 2020 to 23 April 2020.

Net cash used in investing activities was £85.5 million, £66.0 million and £57.4 million in financial year 2018,
2019 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities in all financial years predominantly relates to the purchase
of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

Net cash used in financing activities was £139.7 million, £145.1 million and £117.6 million in financial year
2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities in financial year 2018 predominantly related to
the payment of interest and dividends, partially off-set by the net proceeds of a refinancing of Center Parcs’ secured debt.
Net cash used in financing activities in financial year 2019 predominantly related to the payment of interest and dividends,
partially off-set by the net proceeds of a refinancing of Center Parcs’ secured debt. Net cash used in financing activities in
financial year 2020 predominantly related to the payment of interest and dividends, off-set by the receipt of an equity
contribution.

Center Parcs defines capital expenditure as additions to property, plant and equipment and other intangible
assets. Center Parcs defines maintenance capital expenditure as the capital expenditure required on the central buildings,
infrastructure and facilities to maintain the ongoing standards of these areas. Center Parcs defines investment capital
expenditure as where it expects to generate a return on capital. Investment capital expenditure includes capital expenditure
incurred in respect of the development of villages, amenities and facilities, including building new accommodation;
upgrading existing accommodation and upgrading, adding or extending restaurants, retail outlets and other facilities.

Capital investments are organised and planned annually around significant, regular planned maintenance and
capital expenditure that is intended to maintain high occupancy levels and drive revenue growth through improved appeal
of accommodation units, facilities and amenities.

The capital refurbishment programme of Center Parcs’ accommodation units can be broken into two distinct
investment cycles within a 16- to 20-year period:

         - _Refurbishment: approximately every eight to ten years, each unit needs to be refurbished to maintain_
Center Parcs’ targeted standards, which typically ensures existing levels of ADR are maintained; and

         - _Upgrade: following the refurbishment cycle there is typically a further eight to ten years before a unit is_
upgraded, which includes a full refurbishment of the unit and also an upgrade of the standard to add new
features and to modernise the style of the unit.

Although investment capital expenditure increases during the investment phase of a refurbishment or upgrade
programme, profit margins and operating profit generally increase in the years following completion of the investment
programmes as guests demand higher-end or upgraded accommodation.

During the closure of Center Parcs’ villages from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020, Center Parcs rephased its
capital expenditure, stopping approximately 90% of active projects in order to preserve liquidity.

94


-----

The covenants under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement require the Obligors to spend a minimum of
£18.5 million per year in relation to maintenance capital expenditure and an average of £6.0 million per annum over a four
year period on investment capital expenditure. Total capital expenditure was £84.5 million, £66.1 million and £52.8 million
for financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Center Parcs spent £27.5 million on maintenance capital expenditure
and £25.3 million on investment capital expenditure in financial year 2020, of which investment capital expenditure of
£6.2 million related to new builds, £13.4 million related to accommodation upgrades and £5.7 million related to other
investment projects such as food and beverage, retail and leisure activity offerings. Center Parcs spent £27.1 million on
maintenance capital expenditure and £39.1 million on investment capital expenditure in financial year 2019, of which
investment capital expenditure of £10.3 million related to new builds, £12.1 million related to accommodation upgrades,
£9.0 million related to pool complex upgrades and £7.7 million related to other investment projects such as food and
beverage, retail and leisure activity offerings. Historically, changes in capital expenditure have been driven primarily by
varying levels of investment capital expenditure (including accommodation upgrades) with underlying maintenance capital
expenditure remaining relatively stable. In financial years 2020 and 2021, Center Parcs continued its upgrade programme
and 1,943 units of accommodation have been upgraded as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, driving continued
growth in ADR. In order to support liquidity in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs currently
expects to decrease its total capital expenditure in financial year 2021 to approximately £40.0 million, with investments in
lodge upgrades, new builds and on-village projects.

**Working capital**

Center Parcs has historically had negative working capital requirements largely arising from the payment by
guests for their short breaks in advance of arrival. Following the reopening of the villages on 13 July 2020, Center Parcs
anticipates gradually continuing to increase village operations during financial year 2021.

Center Parcs’ trade receivables are primarily composed of corporate sales made through its Corporate Events
division, and inventories are primarily composed of stock in Center Parcs retail and food and beverage outlets. Center
Parcs’ trade and other payables primarily relate to advance accommodation income received from guests, trade creditors,
accrued expenditure, VAT and payroll taxes due and other current liabilities.

Center Parcs has historically funded working capital requirements through cash generated from operations.
There is a degree of seasonality in the working capital requirements linked to accommodation revenue receipts.

Payments held on account have historically been at their lowest level after the Christmas period and prior to the
key booking period of late December to late February and at the end of each calendar year. This contrasts with the
significantly higher payments held on account typically seen in April or in advance of the summer holiday season.

Depending upon its rate of growth and profitability, Center Parcs may require additional equity or debt financing
to meet working capital requirements or capital expenditure needs. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if
needed, will be available when required or, if available, on terms satisfactory to Center Parcs.

**Contractual commitments**

As at 23 April 2020, Center Parcs had capital expenditure contracted for but not provided of £11.1 million. The
related projects have since been completed or are currently ongoing. Center Parcs has no other material contractual
commitments with the exception of the headleases on the Longleat and Woburn properties. The total current annual rentals
on these leases are approximately £0.9 million and £0.6 million, respectively, and the lease termination dates are
22 February 2073 and 23 December 2109, respectively. The rent in respect of each lease is subject to review every five
years, based on any increase in revenue.

**Off-balance sheet arrangements and contingent liabilities**

Center Parcs has no off-balance sheet arrangements or contingent liabilities.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market and Credit risks**

**_Market risks_**

_General economic conditions_

The disposable income of Center Parcs’ guests and/or their holiday preferences are and will be affected by changes
in the general economic environment and this may result in a fall in the number of guests and/or a decrease in on-site

-----

expenditure. Center Parcs regularly reviews its product offering and engages with guests to ensure it provides value for
money to meet guest needs.

_Brexit_

Until the terms of the UK’s formal exit from the European Union are finalised it remains difficult for businesses
to predict the impact it will have on them and their financial performance. Thus far, the formal exit as not had a material
impact on the business of Center Parcs. However, Center Parcs will continue to monitor political and economic
developments and has plans in place for all eventualities.

_COVID-19_

Starting with the closure of the villages in March 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on
Center Parcs’ business. Whilst the villages are now re-opened the situation continues to evolve with government advice
being regularly updated. The measures mandated by the UK government are outside the control of Center Parcs. However,
Center Parcs has experienced teams who are capable of managing the impacts of the disruption on guests, colleagues and
other key stakeholders. These teams have already put in place procedures to ensure the safe re-opening of the villages and
Center Parcs will continue to monitor changing advice and implement further procedures as required.

Although Center Parcs’ villages are now open it is not clear how long government restrictions and social
distancing measures will last, or whether tighter restrictions will be reintroduced resulting in one or more villages having
to close again. It is therefore not certain how quickly operations will return to pre-crisis levels, if at all.

If these risks and uncertainties materialise, they could result in a material change in the forecast liquidity position
of Center Parcs.

_Competition_

The Center Parcs brand is synonymous with high quality short breaks in a forest environment but Center Parcs
competes for the discretionary expenditure of potential guests, who could choose to take short breaks at other destinations
or participate in other recreational activities. Center Parcs believes that this risk is mitigated by the strength of the Center
Parcs brand and the continual investment in the accommodation and central facilities (including retail and restaurants),
coupled with the innovation amongst the leisure activities and the responsiveness to guest surveys.

_Seasonality and weather_

Demand for short breaks is influenced by the main holiday periods at Easter, the summer holidays and the
Christmas/New Year period. This risk is mitigated by online dynamic pricing which encourages demand outside of the
peak periods. The accommodation is located within forest environments and a significant number of activities take place
outdoors. Therefore, demand may be impacted by the prevailing weather. This risk is minimal because guests tend not to
book on impulse and the vast majority of breaks and activities are booked in advance. Additionally, Center Parcs maintains
diversity between its indoor and outdoor activities to mitigate this risk.

**_Financial risks_**

The Directors and senior managers regularly review the financial requirements of Center Parcs and the
associated risks. Center Parcs does not use complicated financial instruments and where financial instruments are used they
are used to reduce interest rate risk. Center Parcs does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. Center Parcs
finances its operations through a mixture of retained earnings and borrowings as required. Historically, Center Parcs has
sought to reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring its funding using the underlying asset value.

_Interest rate risk_

Principal sources of borrowings are fixed interest rate loan notes.

_Liquidity risk_

Center Parcs maintains sufficient levels of cash and committed funding to enable it to meet its medium-term
working capital, lease liability and funding obligations. Rolling forecasts of liquidity requirements are prepared and
monitored, and surplus cash is invested in interest bearing accounts.

96


-----

_Currency risk_

Whilst no borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies, a number of suppliers are exposed to the euro and
the U.S. dollar. Wherever possible Center Parcs enters into supply contracts denominated in Sterling. Center Parcs does
not operate a hedging facility to manage currency risk as it is not considered to be material.

_Credit risk_

Cash balances are held on deposit with a number of UK banking institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with
respect to trade receivables are limited as the vast majority of guests pay in advance.

_Financial reporting risk_

The Group’s financial systems are required to process a large number of transactions securely and accurately;
any weaknesses in the systems could result in the incorrect reporting of financial results and covenant compliance.

**Accounting policies**

The following accounting policies are considered to be pertinent to this review of Center Parcs’ operating and
financial results. See Note 1 to the 2020 Audited Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

_Revenue recognition_

Revenue relates to accommodation rental income on holidays commenced during the period, together with other
related income that primarily arises from on-village leisure, retail and food and beverage spend. Revenue relating to
accommodation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the holiday. The performance obligation for nonrental income, and hence the basis for revenue recognition, is when the related product or service is provided to the guest.
All revenue is recorded net of VAT.

Payment for accommodation rental income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded as
‘deferred income’ within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences. As such no revenue was recognised during
the period the villages were closed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A number of trading units on each holiday village are operated by concession partners. Revenue due in respect
of such units is recognised on an accruals basis.

All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.

_Property, plant and equipment_

Center Parcs carries property, plant and equipment at cost rather than current valuation. As such, no increases
in the value of Center Parcs’ property, plant and equipment are recognised in the financial statements. Any impairment to
the carrying value of these assets is recognised in the income statement.

_Maintenance expenditure_

It is the policy of Center Parcs to maintain its land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance
expenditure increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to generate, this expenditure is capitalised.
All other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

_Borrowings_

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

**Critical accounting policies**

_Discount rate used to determine the value of Center Parcs’ defined benefit pension scheme obligation_

Center Parcs’ defined benefit pension scheme obligation is discounted at a rate set by reference to market yields
at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Significant judgment is required when setting the criteria
for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived.

_Useful economic lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets_

97


-----

Center Parcs reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets at the
end of each reporting period. During the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020, management has concluded that no revision
is required to either useful economic lives or residual values of these assets.

_Impairment test for goodwill_

Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units
to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires Center Parcs to estimate future cash flows
expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.

**Overview of the UK Holiday Market**

The UK holiday market is defined as the market for UK residents holidaying in the UK (domestic but excluding
Northern Ireland) and UK residents holidaying internationally (overseas).

Center Parcs operates in the UK holiday centres market, which consists of three segments: (a) traditional holiday
centres; (b) holiday parks centred around caravan or lodge accommodation; and (c) forest villages. These sub-segments
of the holiday market are described later on in this section.

**Economic Environment and Outlook**

**_Global Financial Crisis and Aftermath_**

Based on Mintel’s analysis, following the global financial crisis in 2008, the performance of the UK holiday
market was continuously impacted until 2014. Historical data shows that growth rates in domestic tourism tend to
rise and fall in relation to growth rates in the overseas holiday market. The last recession worked to the advantage
of UK tourism, in which Center Parcs is present, triggering a steep drop in holidays abroad and a “staycation effect”
which saw many consumers switching from overseas destinations to holidays closer to home.

Since 2012, based on the International Passenger Survey (“IPS”) by the Office of National Statistics (“ONS”)
and the Great Britain Tourism Survey by VisitEngland, VisitScotland and Visit Wales (“GBTS”), overseas holiday
volumes experienced a period of steady recovery, growing an estimated 21% from 2014 to 2019. In contrast, volumes
in the UK market fell by 7% in 2014, before recovering at an estimated 4% from 2015 to 2019, with the growth in both
segments reflecting rising economic recovery and consumer confidence. Total spend on overseas holidays grew from
£24.4 billion in 2014 to £32.2 billion in 2018 (driven by the recovery in volumes and an increase in average spend). The
average spend on overseas holidays increased at a higher rate than UK holidays at 8% over the period from £634 in 2014
to £684 in 2018. Total spend on UK holidays for 2018 sat at £14.3 billion, with an average spend of £247.

**_Post-Brexit Performance_**

Since the Brexit vote in June 2016, the Pound’s decline in value has made overseas trips more expensive for UK
consumers. A weaker Pound was one of the main contributors to the staycation boom in 2009, according to Mintel, and
is expected to affect domestic UK travel, as consumers choose to holiday at home. Indeed, this effect coupled with
broader Brexit uncertainties led to a slowdown in growth in overseas holidays over 2017 and 2018, with volumes rising
by 4% and 1%, respectively. In contrast, volumes in the UK market experienced a healthy increase of 6% in 2017,
followed by a decline of 2% in 2018.

Annual overseas trip volume has remained above the 45.5 million trip milestone since 2017, which according to
Mintel’s research in 2018 was a record high reached before the 2008 recession, and was estimated by the ONS to be
approximately 47.7 million trips in 2019. Total spend on overseas holidays grew from £30.1 billion in 2016 to £32.2
billion in 2018, with average spend increasing by 2% over the period from £669 in 2016 to £684 in 2018.

For UK holidays, total spend increased from £13.3 billion in 2016 to £14.3 billion in 2018, with average spend
increasing to £247, a 4% increase on 2016. Mintel estimates growth of 2.9% in the volume of domestic holidays taken
by British residents in 2019, to 59.6 million. In January 2020, Mintel forecast an expected CAGR of 1.1% in the volume
of domestic holidays taken by British residents from 2019 to 2023.

Mintel’s research, based on published ONS and GBTS data, indicates that total holiday market volume in
the UK grew at an estimated 1.7% CAGR from 2015 to 2019 to an estimated 106.0 million trips annually in 2019,
with annual expenditure growing at an estimated 3.9% CAGR over the same period to an estimated £46.8 billion
in 2019. Growth from 2016 to 2019 was mainly driven by faster growth in domestic tourism volumes compared to
overseas volume, as Brexit uncertainty and a weak Pound drove consumers to save money by holidaying closer to

home.

In January 2020, Mintel reported an expectation of modest growth in the UK staycation market over 202024, with volume growth of between 0.7-1.5% and value growth of between 0.8-1.7% per annum. Mintel forecast
volumes to reach 63.2 million and value to reach £15.3 billion by 2024. Mintel also reported that over the longer
term, the development of additional high speed rail capacity within the UK, such as HS2, has potential to tempt
travelers to swap one of their overseas short breaks for a staycation.

**_Outlook and Impact of COVID-19_**

The global COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns both in the UK and internationally have had a
dramatic impact on the domestic and overseas holiday market. According to CAPA, European airline seat capacity
experienced several recurring weeks of 80%+ year-on-year declines during April and May, with evidence of a
gradual recovery taking hold post the easing of lockdown restrictions.

In June 2020, Mintel reported that it expects overseas holidays to be heavily disrupted as a result of COVID19, even once the possibility of taking such holidays returns. Mintel expects staycations to recover faster when the
recovery begins, with COVID-19 accelerating demand for wellness breaks and activities. This is supported by
VisitBritain’s COVID-19 Consumer Weekly Tracker for 6-10 July, which highlights outdoor areas, the seaside
and countryside as the most likely destinations of survey respondents between June and September. In each of the
eight surveys conducted through 14 July 2020 as part of the COVID-19 Consumer Weekly Tracker, country/trail
walks have consistently been ranked as the activity that respondents are most comfortable doing in the near term
(i.e., within the next month or so).

According to VisitBritain, 48% intend to take the same number or more short breaks, defined as 1-3 nights,
in the UK over the rest of 2020 than normal, with 35% expecting to take fewer short breaks (17% being unsure).
For breaks of 4+ nights, these figures are 44%, 36% and 20%, respectively. The same survey suggests that overseas
trips will be more negatively impacted, with 44% of respondents intending to take fewer trips than normal and
30% intending to take more or the same number of trips. 44% have either already planned or intend to plan a UK
short break or holiday by September, and 36% have already booked or intend to book their trip by this time. For
those taking trips between June and September 2020, 65% expect to travel using their own car, versus 50% for
trips taken from October 2020 to March 2021.

VisitBritain suggests that ‘outdoor areas’, ‘outdoor leisure or sports activities’, and ‘predominantly outdoor
attractions’, are all likely to attract more visitors than normal, while ‘indoor wellbeing’, ‘entertainment’ (including
cinemas and restaurants) and ‘predominantly indoor attractions’ are likely to attract fewer guests than normal.

In England, large parts of the hospitality sector were allowed to reopen from 4 July 2020, with certain
restrictions and after making necessary adjustments to accommodate social distancing and enhanced cleaning
regimes.

**UK Holiday Centre Market Trends**

The longer-term key trends impacting the UK holiday centres market include the following:

**_Change in Guests: Socio-Economic Profile_**

According to Mintel, changes in socio-economic groups (“SEG”) and in particular the growth in the ABC1
category (“ABC1”) have historically benefited the holiday market and are likely to continue to do so in the medium
term. SEGs are based on the chief income earner and are defined as follows:

**SEG** **Occupation of Chief Income Earner**

A . . . . .  Higher managerial, administrative or professional

B . . . . .  Intermediate managerial, administrative or professional

C1 . . . .  Supervisory or clerical and junior managerial, administrative or professional

C2 . . . .  Skilled manual workers

D . . . . .  Semi and unskilled manual workers

E . . . . .  Entirely dependent on the state long term, through sickness, unemployment, old age or other reasons

With high standards and expectations for their holidays, the ABC1 SEGs form the core target customer base for
Center Parcs. According to the latest available data, the ABC1 segment as a whole represented 55% of the UK

**_Changes in Demographics_**

According to the ONS, growth in demand for holiday centres in the UK is expected to be positively affected by
demographic changes, including the rise in the number of families with young children in particular. The number of
children aged 10-14 in the UK is forecast to increase by 9.5% by 2023, from 3.9 million in 2018 to 4.2 million in 2023.
The number of 15-19 year olds is forecast to increase by 8.2% over the same period.

The ONS forecasts the number of adults aged 25-44 years to increase from 17.4 million in 2018 to 17.8 million
in 2023 (an increase of approximately 2.7%). This growth is expected to benefit the UK holiday centre market as it
increases the number of prime target guests, namely families, for holiday centres over the short to medium term.

Mintel believes the government’s existing railcard discount scheme for 16 to 25-year-olds (offering a 30%
discount) which was extended to those aged between 26 and 30 in the spring of 2018, should incent 26 to 30-year-olds
to visit more UK destinations for breaks.

**_Multiple Holiday Taking and Trend Towards Shorter Breaks_**

The trend towards shorter breaks remains steady with the UK short break market being far more stable over the
past five years than the UK domestic market as a whole. According to the GBTS by VisitEngland, VisitScotland and
Visit Wales, short breaks comprising between one to three nights accounted for almost two-thirds of the total UK
domestic tourism market over 2015 to 2018, and the volume of breaks of up to 7 days increased by 1.4% over the same
period. In January 2020, Mintel reported that 20% of domestic holidaymakers planned to take more staycations in the
12 months following November 2019. 17% of all holidaymakers (including domestic and overseas holidaymakers)
planned to take more short breaks versus 16% looking to take more long breaks.

-----

According to the IPS by the ONS and GBTS by VisitEngland, VisitScotland, Visit Wales, domestic holidays
account for 55% of the overall UK holiday market. Mintel estimates the number of domestic holidays taken grew by
2.9% to an estimated 59.6 million trips in 2019 from 57.9 million in 2018, while holiday expenditure is estimated to
have risen marginally by 0.2% to £14.3 billion. Mintel’s research indicates that 62% of the UK adult population took a
domestic holiday in the year to November 2019, versus 50% who took a holiday overseas.

Domestic holiday participation has risen since the Brexit referendum in 2016, which, according to Mintel, shows
that holidaying is among the highest priorities of British nationals. As shown in the chart below, countryside holidays’
share of domestic market has historically remained broadly the same, reflecting stable demand for holiday offerings in
natural surroundings.

Countryside/Village Volume % of Domestic Holiday Volume

Source: GBTS / Mintel (from Mintel Domestic Tourism, October 2019)

(1) Percentage calculations based on total holiday volumes consisting of the sum for the following categories: Seaside, City/large town, Small town
and Countryside/village. The sum of the four destination types exceeds total market volume reported in the October 2019 Domestic Tourism
report as there are a proportion of holidays which combine more than one destination type.

According to Mintel a “digital detox” trend is emerging, where city dwellers seek to escape their smartphones
and computers. Thus, there is a growing need for holiday brands to encourage those in the 16-34 year old age bracket
to disconnect and de-stress in the countryside. There are also opportunities to target families, as according to Mintel’s
Domestic Tourism – UK, October 2018 Report, 76% of parents with children under 18 agree that it is important to limit
the time spent on smartphones and computers while on holiday.

**Market Segmentation and Product Offering**

While Center Parcs believes that it has a unique product offering, it is sometimes considered to be part of the UK
holiday centres market. The UK holiday centres market is divided into three distinct segments: (a) traditional holiday
centres; (b) holiday parks (large caravan/chalet parks offering an extensive range of holiday centre facilities); and (c)
forest villages (also considered as holiday centres but aimed more at rural quiet rather than holiday bustle). These
segments compete with each other to a certain extent within the UK holiday centres market. However, while traditional
holiday centres and holiday parks tend to be coastal sites, dominated by guests mainly from the C1-C2 socioeconomic category, forest villages are based in woodland sites and attract mainly ABC1 families looking for
active forest village breaks and premium lodge park accommodation.

According to Mintel, nearly half of parents believe it is important to stay in a resort with family-friendly elements
such as pools, children’s activities and entertainment. This is now becoming a strong selling point for family holidays
in the context of rising childhood obesity, increasing amounts of time spent by children on technology devices, and a
perceived lack of safe public spaces for children to play outside the home. Leading overseas holiday brands are investing
heavily in their own bespoke family resort brands. In the domestic UK market, leading holiday centre brands such as
Center Parcs, Butlins and Haven offer a similar experience. Moreover, the focal point of Center Parcs’ villages is its
Sub-tropical Swimming Paradise which, together with Center Parcs’ premium product offering (accommodation,
leisure activities, food and beverage, retail and Aqua Sana spa), underpins the attractiveness of the Center Parcs’ concept
for ABC1 guests.

_Traditional holiday centres comprise the traditional brands such as Butlins, Warner and Pontins (a smaller UK_
operator), which were originally based on a 1950s “holiday camp” formula. They have evolved over time (now fewer
in numbers and individually larger in scale) and have invested significantly in recent years in improving their
accommodation and range of activities. These traditional centres are generally in beach locations and therefore tend to
primarily complement a family beach holiday. They are characterised by permanent accommodation (rather than
mobile homes) in blocks or detached buildings. Their offering may be full board or self-catering, but generally
includes free family-oriented entertainment, variety shows and leisure facilities, such as swimming pools, amusement
arcades, fairground-type rides and outdoor sports facilities, such as five-a-side football, a climbing wall and crazy golf.

_Holiday parks_ constitute the largest sector within the UK holiday centres market, both by number of
locations and volume of holidays sold and comprise brands such as Parkdean Resorts, Haven and Hoseasons.
However, within the holiday park segment, it is difficult to distinguish between what are essentially larger caravan
parks with few facilities, and those parks with amenities and activities that are sophisticated enough to be categorised
as a traditional holiday centre. As consumer expectations increase, there is more demand for holiday parks to provide
a greater range of value- added services such as pools, restaurants, children’s clubs and entertainment. Holiday parks
cater to customers looking for three types of services: (a) hiring mobile homes or fixed caravans; (b) purchasing these
mobile homes; and (c) hiring space for towed caravans and tent campers. Although they vary considerably in size,
holiday parks are generally smaller in scale than the traditional holiday centres. Holiday parks are often situated in coastal
locations, often in scenic areas.

_Forest villages_ differ from traditional holiday centres and holiday parks which are part of the tradition of the
British seaside holiday. Forest villages are based inland, in woodland and water settings, with an explicitly
environmental ethos (a car-free, family-friendly environment), marketed primarily and explicitly to affluent family
groups in the ABC1 SEGs, as compared with the broader targeting of the traditional holiday centres. The accommodation
in forest villages is permanent and generally more spacious than traditional holiday centres. Forest village
accommodation provides self- catering facilities and open-plan living, with luxurious top-end accommodation standards.
The focus is activity-based, with a wide range of sporting, creative and spa/therapeutic activities geared towards both
adults and children. Unlike most traditional holiday centres, which include a wide range of entertainment and activities

as part of the basic holiday package, forest village holiday providers offer a customised approach and charge extra for
individual activities. Furthermore, forest villages operate 365 days per year, offering guests a high quality experience
under all types of weather through a wide range of indoor and outdoor activities and amenities.

**Business Overview**

Center Parcs is a leading UK short-break holiday business, attracting over 2.1 million guests in the 52-week period
ended 27 February 2020. Center Parcs operates five specially constructed holiday villages in the United Kingdom:
Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Elveden Forest in Suffolk, Whinfell Forest in Cumbria
(the “Original Villages”) and Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire. Each village is set in a forest environment amongst
approximately 400 acres of forest around a lake and is open 365 days per year.

Woodland, water and a natural environment make up the essential environment of a Center Parcs break. Within
this comfortable, quiet, car-free and family-friendly setting, each of the Center Parcs villages provides guests with high
quality accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. In total, as of 28 August 2020, there were 4,335 units
of accommodation across its five villages, which could accommodate approximately 22,958 guests per day at 100%
occupancy. The focal point and key attraction of each village is an all-weather indoor sub-tropical swimming paradise,
featuring a selection of water activities including a wave pool, river slides and rides, children’s pools and Jacuzzis. Center
Parcs’ on-site experiences also include outdoor activities such as cycling, boating and zip wires; indoor activities such as
ten-pin bowling, badminton and pottery; and amenities such as spas, food and beverage and retail. A significant proportion
of Center Parcs’ revenue is generated from guests’ on-site spending, including for leisure and spa activities, food and
beverage and retail, representing 39.2% of total revenue in financial year 2020.

Center Parcs has a well-established brand in the UK, renowned for providing high quality experiences and
facilities, targeting a primary guest base of affluent families. Center Parcs benefits from strong guest loyalty with
approximately 34% of guests returning within 14 months and approximately 54% returning over a five-year period. In
addition, Center Parcs believes that its business model is difficult to replicate due to the lack of suitable locations for the
development of holiday parks and high development costs while Center Parcs is well positioned to continue to grow its
business.

Center Parcs’ villages typically draw on a regional population of guests who are attracted to the convenience of
being within a relatively short driving distance from home. Over 90% of the UK population lives within a 2.5 hour drive
of at least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two hour drive of the village
they choose to visit. Center Parcs believes that the proximity of the majority of guests to its villages combined with the
easy accessibility of the villages by car make Center Parcs a popular and convenient short break holiday option. Occupancy
levels at Center Parcs’ villages have been consistently high: 97.6% in financial year 2018, 97.1% in financial year 2019,
and 97.3% in the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. Occupancy levels have averaged approximately 96% in the last
15 years to 27 February 2020, and approximately 97% in the last eight years to 27 February 2020, despite the expansion
of existing accommodation offerings at Center Parcs’ Original Villages and the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014.

For the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, Center Parcs had revenue of £496.3 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of £239.4 million, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.2%.

In each of the financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have been
broadly evenly split amongst Center Parcs’ villages, reflecting both the individual strength of each village and the diversity
of Center Parcs’ asset base.

The map below shows the location of each of Center Parcs’ villages as of 13 July 2020.

With the exception of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have consistently
grown over the past ten years. Total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were £496.3 million and £239.4 million,
respectively, for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. Adjusted EBITDA margins grew from 42.4% in financial
year 2008 to 48.2% in the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020.

**History of the Center Parcs Group**

The Center Parcs concept was pioneered by Piet Derksen in the late 1960s in the Netherlands as a new form of
self-catering, high-comfort holiday village, complemented with heated bungalows, open fires, central heating, colour TVs
and covered swimming pools. Derksen expanded the chain over the course of the following two decades into Belgium,
France and Germany, and, in 1987, the first Center Parcs opened in the United Kingdom at Sherwood Forest. The first
British village was closely followed by a second at Elveden Forest in 1989. In 1994, Center Parcs further expanded with
the creation of the third village, Longleat Forest, near Bath. In 2001, Center Parcs acquired the Oasis Holiday Village (now
called Whinfell Forest) in the northwest of England from the Bourne Leisure Group, thus enhancing Center Parcs’
geographic footprint in the UK. In 2001, the continental European “Center Parcs” business was separated from the United
Kingdom “Center Parcs” business and the two have been under separate ownership from that point onward. In November

107


-----

2010, Center Parcs received reserved matters planning approval of its plan to develop and build a fifth village situated near
Woburn in Bedfordshire. The development of Woburn Forest commenced in May 2012 and opened to guests in June 2014.

The Blackstone Funds bought the operating business in May 2006 and subsequently delisted it from the London
Stock Exchange where it had been listed on the AIM in 2003 and on the Main Market in 2005. Shortly thereafter,
Blackstone Funds purchased the property companies owning the four Original Villages in June 2006. In August 2015,
certain funds managed by affiliates of Brookfield Management Inc. (the “Brookfield Funds”) acquired Center Parcs from
the Blackstone Funds.

Since 2006, Center Parcs has implemented programmes to upgrade accommodation and to upgrade and expand
on-site offerings. In July 2019, Center Parcs opened its sixth village, Longford Forest, in County Longford, Republic of
Ireland. Longford Forest is Center Parcs’ first village outside of the United Kingdom. Longford Forest is outside of the
Obligor Group.

**Key Strengths**

**_Unique, market-leading short break holiday business._**

Center Parcs believes that it provides a unique product in the UK holiday market in terms of scale, quality and
standard of accommodation and amenities. Each Center Parcs village is set in approximately 400 acres of forest around a
lake, with numerous retail and food and beverage offerings, as well as more than 150 leisure and spa related activities and
an indoor sub-tropical swimming paradise. Each village has on average 866 units of accommodation with capacity for
approximately 4,580 guests. Center Parcs believes that it is the only large-scale UK business offering this type of high
quality family-focused, year-round, all-weather, short-break package, in a forest environment. Center Parcs believes that it
is well-positioned to benefit from pent-up demand for domestic travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with its
villages typically drawing on a regional population of guests who live within a relatively short driving distance. Further,
the design of Center Parcs’ villages lends itself well to social distancing, as most guests travel to the villages in their own
cars, the lodges provide for self-catering, the villages are spread out over a large open footprint and many of the activities
are outdoors.

**_Difficult to replicate concept with well-known brand and loyal, affluent customer base._**

The Center Parcs villages are characterised by a number of qualities that Center Parcs believes make its business
model difficult to replicate in the United Kingdom. These include:

    - limited appropriate sites for villages, which require large forested areas near major population centres;

    - long lead time needed to develop new villages due to the stringent requirements for obtaining planning
permits;

    - significant initial investment cost in addition to on-going capital expenditure required for further
development and operations of the business; and

    - a wide range of specialised operations and planning expertise required to develop and operate a village.

Center Parcs’ unique product offering has generated strong brand recognition and guest loyalty. Center Parcs
believes that it has high brand recognition in the UK and is considered among the top brands for high quality short breaks
in the UK.

Center Parcs’ “intention to return” score was 95% in financial year 2020. Approximately 34% of Center Parcs’
guests return within 14 months and approximately 54% return over a five-year period. Center Parcs’ active marketable
guest base was approximately 309,000 households in 2020.

In 2019, three of Center Parcs’ Aqua Sana spas were shortlisted for Good Spa Awards, and Aqua Sana Sherwood
Forest was awarded Best Destination Spa in the UK. Aqua Sana Sherwood Forest had previously been awarded Best Spa
in the East Midlands and the East in November 2018.

Center Parcs’ guest profile has remained stable over time and consists of the highest earning categories of the UK
population. According to management estimates, Center Parcs ranked significantly over index in a number of the Experian
high end consumer classifications, with 57% of guests in financial year 2019 identified under the Experian Mosaic
classification as “Domestic Success”, “Prestige Positions” or “Aspiring Homemakers” based on postcode analysis.

**_Resilient growth through economic cycles._**

108


-----

Resilient performance through economic cycles, during both downturns and recoveries, and also through additions
in capacity, has resulted in Center Parcs’ occupancy levels averaging over 90% over the last 20 years to 27 February 2020,
approximately 96% in the last 15 years to 27 February 2020 and approximately 97% in the last eight years to
27 February 2020, with occupancy levels of 97.6%, 97.1% and 97.3% in financial years 2018 and 2019 and the 52-week
period ended 27 February 2020, respectively. Occupancy at each of the villages has historically remained high even after
the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014 despite an approximately 20% increase in Center Parcs’ accommodation available,
demonstrating the depth of demand for Center Parcs’ villages. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic
conditions as well as on guests’ willingness to travel, and the restrictions on Center Parcs’ ability to operate at full capacity
following the re-opening of the villages on 13 July 2020, demand for Center Parcs’ villages remains resilient and is already
exceeding expected operating capacity for some breaks. As at 21 August 2020, forward bookings for the third quarter and
fourth quarter of financial year 2021 (including bookings that have been moved with a financial incentive from the COVID19 closure period) were approximately 1% and 9% higher, respectively, than forward bookings at the same point during
financial year 2020, despite a significant reduction in marketing expenditure during the closure of Center Parcs’ villages
from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

High occupancy levels drive a significant proportion of revenue from guests’ on-site spending, which represented
39.2% of Center Parcs’ total revenue in financial year 2020.

ADR on average also consistently grew above inflation between financial year 2008 and the 52-week period ended
27 February 2020, at a CAGR of 3.6%. During this period, Center Parcs’ RevPAL growth was approximately twice the
growth in inflation and UK RevPAR during the period. The growth in Center Parcs’ ADR has been driven by yield
management initiatives, demand and on-site investment, including in new types of accommodation and upgrades to existing
accommodation.

**_Consistent revenue growth with strong visibility through forward-booking model._**

With the exception of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in financial year 2020, Center Parcs has experienced
revenue growth each year over the last ten years, with revenue growing at a CAGR of 5.5% from financial year 2008 to
the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. In addition, Center Parcs’ Adjusted EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of 6.6%
from financial year 2008 to the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. Center Parcs places a strong emphasis on advance
prepaid bookings, which result in significant revenue visibility, with an average of 19 weeks’ booking-to-arrival time in
financial years 2018 to 2020. For each of financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, an average of approximately 43% of the
available accommodation nights had been booked by the beginning of the financial year, an average of 59% by the end of
the first quarter, an average of 76% halfway through the financial year, and an average of 95% two months before the end
of the financial year.

Under its standard terms and conditions, Center Parcs collects 30% of the accommodation cost at the time of
booking if completed more than ten weeks in advance of the short break. The balance of the cost is collected ten weeks
prior to the start of the break. If a guest books less than ten weeks prior to the arrival date, the accommodation cost is
payable in full on booking. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some changes have been made to these conditions, but
a reversion to standard terms and conditions is expected. Similarly, in the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, more
than 64% of leisure and spa activities were pre-booked and pre-paid prior to arrival. This significant revenue visibility
allows Center Parcs to optimise its cost structure according to anticipated occupancy levels and demand throughout the
year. As a result of its flexible cost base, Center Parcs reduced operating expenses by approximately £14 million on average
per four-week period, or approximately 70%, to approximately £6 million on average per four-week period from
24 April 2020 to 18 June 2020, compared to approximately £20 million on average per four-week period from
26 April 2019 to 27 February 2020, by ceasing activity on approximately 90% of active capital investment projects,
furloughing approximately 90% of employees in accordance with the UK government’s CJRS from 27 March 2020 to
3 July 2020 and utilitising the 12-month business rates holiday available to retail, hospitality and leisure businesses.

**_Sustainable cash flow generation._**

With the exception of the periods impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs’ EBITDA margins have
been underpinned by high occupancy levels and consistent growth in ADR. Relatively high EBITDA margins combined
with the negative working capital characteristics of the business due to its forward-booking model and the relatively low
maintenance capital expenditure requirements, which averaged £21.1 million per financial year from financial year 2008
to financial year 2020, has enabled Center Parcs to be highly cash generative, with cash conversion (defined as Adjusted
EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure plus working capital and non-cash movements (less difference between the
pension charge and contribution), expressed as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA) in excess of 85% in each of financial
years 2018 and 2019 and the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, at 94.1%, 91.2%, and 87.4%, respectively. Center
Parcs addressed the impact of the closure of its villages due to the COVID-19 pandemic by aiming to minimise the
proportion of guests seeking refunds by offering a £100 financial incentive to guests to move dates. Approximately 35%
of guests opted to change their booking dates instead of cancelling altogether. In addition, Center Parcs was also able to
further manage cash flow by ceasing activity on approximately 90% of active capital investment projects during the closure.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Brookfield reiterated its commitment to Center Parcs through equity contributions of
£69 million, comprising £41.5 million received in April 2020 and £27.5 million received in May 2020, and the
Intercompany Account Advance of £70 million received on 14 July 2020. These commitments are part of a total of
£160 million of financial support available to Center Parcs that has been approved by the Brookfield Funds.

**_Well-invested, diversified and high-quality asset base._**

Center Parcs owns all five of its UK villages on either freehold titles or long leasehold titles, and with remaining
lease terms of between 53 years and 980 years, Center Parcs’ asset base has a long life and is diversified and stable. In
financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have been broadly evenly split amongst

110


-----

its villages, located in different parts of the UK, reflecting both the individual strength of each village and the diversity of
Center Parcs’ asset base.

Center Parcs has an on-going capital expenditure programme to maintain and enhance the quality of its asset base,
pursuant to which it has invested approximately £724 million from financial year 2008 through financial year 2020. Of this
investment, £279 million represents maintenance capital expenditures. The remainder represents investment capital
expenditure, of which £212 million was invested to upgrade existing accommodation, £100 million was invested to build
new developments, £116 million was invested in on-site development, including new leisure activities, food and beverage
offerings and facilities upgrades and £17 million was invested in its Digital Roadmap project. In addition, Center Parcs
incurred approximately £250 million of total initial development costs in respect of building Woburn Forest.

Since the acquisition of Center Parcs by the Brookfield Funds in August 2015, the amount of total capital
expenditure has increased from £43 million (of which investment capital expenditure: £19 million) in financial year 2015
to £84.5 million (of which investment capital expenditure: £59 million), £66.1 million (of which investment capital
expenditure: £39 million) and £52.8 million (of which investment capital expenditure: £25 million) in financial years 2018,
2019 and 2020, respectively, reflecting Brookfield’s commitment to the business and focus on a range of capital investment
opportunities to further grow the business. In financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, the construction of new build
accommodation comprised approximately £25 million, £10 million and £6 million, respectively, of investment capital
expenditure, while a range of ongoing village refurbishments of accommodation, restaurants, retail outlets, spas and other
offerings and facilities comprised the remainder.

**_Experienced management team with a track record of innovation._**

Center Parcs has an experienced management team with a proven ability to execute its business plans and achieve
results. In addition, Center Parcs’ management team has a track record of innovation reflected in its yield management
initiatives, innovation in on-site activities and food and beverage offerings, as well as development of new types of
accommodation to help drive ADR. In 2014, the management team successfully opened Woburn Forest on time and on
budget. With an average length of service of over 15 years by individual members of its management team, the management
team is highly experienced in providing the services that set Center Parcs apart from other UK leisure and holiday providers.
Center Parcs also benefits from the operational expertise, relationships, and management experience of Brookfield.

**Strategy**

**_Continue to grow revenue through yield management, flexible pricing, targeted marketing and customer relationship_**
**_management._**

Center Parcs actively manages pricing across its villages to maintain its high level of occupancy and to optimise
yield during periods of high demand. All bookings are made directly with Center Parcs, with approximately 87% of
accommodation bookings made online in financial year 2020. Together with its strong emphasis on advance bookings
(average 19 weeks’ booking-to-arrival time period in financial years 2018 to 2020), this provides Center Parcs with
significant operational information, allowing it to respond quickly to customer trends in order to optimise its pricing. Center
Parcs will continue to operate a flexible pricing model to further grow revenue, and to develop its customer relationship
management initiatives to increase demand from the affluent families that form its core guest base. Following the reopening
of the villages on 13 July 2020, Center Parcs’ villages initially operated at approximately 65% capacity, which was
increased to 75% capacity on 7 September 2020. Capacity levels will be reviewed in due course pursuant to government
guidelines and health and safety considerations.

Center Parcs’ guest database of approximately 309,000 active guests allows it to undertake targeted marketing
campaigns using a range of channels, including direct mailings, online and digital marketing, television campaigns and
email programmes focused on both existing customers and targeted acquisition of new affluent families.

**_Continue to invest in revenue-enhancing upgrades of Center Parcs accommodation offering and to expand available_**
**_capacity._**

Center Parcs plans to continue to invest in upgrading the accommodation and facilities in its villages, and to
introduce new accommodation and on-site activities. Since 2007, Center Parcs has opened over 230 new units of
accommodation at its Original Villages, and significantly upgraded all units of accommodation at the Original Villages at
an average estimated cost of approximately £50,000 per lodge. Following the upgrade of all existing units of
accommodation, Center Parcs has started a new cycle of refurbishment for such accommodation which is important to
maintain quality and generate repeat business and 1,943 units of accommodation have been upgraded as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum.

There is also capacity for additional new builds of premium lodges at Center Parcs’ villages, which typically
achieve a premium over the rate achieved on standard lodges. Center Parcs believes that such premium lodges attract

111


-----

affluent guests who are more likely to be high on-site spenders. Center Parcs currently has planning permission to build a
further 103 units of accommodation. The new units of accommodation are expected to include waterside lodges, apartments
and other executive lodges.

**_Disciplined investment in village experience._**

Center Parcs believes that there are several substantial development projects that could profitably expand Center
Parcs’ offering, including Project Atlantis, which involves the strategic enhancement of the signature sub-tropical
swimming paradise that features at each village. Center Parcs spent approximately £38 million between 2012 and 2020 on
implementing Project Atlantis. Improvements included the addition of a new raft ride, the Tropical Cyclone, and a new
play area featuring numerous slides and water feature at Elveden Forest, Longleat Forest and Sherwood Forest. Over the
next two years, Center Parcs plans to make similar upgrades to the pool facilities at Whinfell Forest. Center Parcs has also
invested approximately £6.5 million in the refurbishment and expansion of the Aqua Sana spa facility at Longleat Forest.

Center Parcs also intends to introduce new leisure activities at each village on a regular basis, as well as innovate
upon its existing offering of leisure activities. Development opportunities include introducing zip wires, electric boats and
expanding indoor climbing activities to all villages. Center Parcs believes that such investments provide an enriched
holiday experience particularly for the affluent families that form its core guest base, and that an improved on-site unique
offering helps to drive both accommodation and on-site revenue.

**_Grow on-site spend._**

Center Parcs generated 40.3%, 39.5% and 39.2% of its total revenue from on-site spend in the financial years
2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. As Center Parcs’ guests typically remain on-site for the duration of their stay, Center
Parcs believes that there are opportunities to grow on-site spend further. For example, Center Parcs has continued to
develop a programme of enhanced differentiation in pricing where prices of various offerings are expected to become
flexible across seasons, days of the week and times of day to more accurately reflect guest demand.

Center Parcs has franchise, licensing and concession agreements with various providers. These concession
partners enable guests to benefit from high street brand offerings and Center Parcs to increase profitability through
increased on-site spend. Center Parcs reviews these agreements periodically to ensure that they remain economically
attractive and meet its guests’ requirements.

**_Continue to increase profitability through controlling costs._**

Center Parcs benefits from having a flexible cost base. Because of the high level of forward booking visibility of
the business, Center Parcs is typically able to manage its cost base effectively to meet its business requirements. As part of
the strategy to seek profitable growth, it intends to continue to generate cost savings through increased efficiency at each
village and at its head office.

Following the reopening of Center Parcs’ villages on 13 July 2020, Center Parcs expects to continue to focus on
cost efficiency and optimisation while complying with new regulations and ensuring the safety of its guests and employees.
Center Parcs expects its operating costs to be higher in the short-term due to the implementation of additional health and
safety procedures pursuant to government guidelines related to COVID-19.

**Business Description**

**_Product Offering_**

Center Parcs’ focus is on the short-break holiday market. Center Parcs’ guests can choose from three pre-defined
break durations: the weekend (Friday to Monday), mid-week (Monday to Friday) or a week (Friday to Friday or Monday
to Monday, comprised of a weekend break and mid-week break). Guests can also book combinations of these breaks.
Accommodation is charged on a per-break rather than per-sleeper or per-night basis (with the exception of the spa suites
which are sold on a per-night basis). Approximately 96% of holidays booked, with the exception of spa breaks, spa suites
and corporate bookings, are for three or four night breaks.

Although located near urban centres, Center Parcs villages are each set within approximately 400 acres of forest
around a lake and offer year-round, all-weather holidays in a car-free natural environment.

Center Parcs generated 59.7%, 60.5%, and 60.8% of its total revenue from accommodation in financial years
2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The proportion of revenue from accommodation in the 52-week periods ended
27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019 was broadly consistent with that in financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Center
Parcs’ occupancy rates have averaged approximately 96% in the last 15 years. As at 21 August 2020, forward bookings
for the third quarter and fourth quarter of financial year 2021 (including bookings that have been moved with a financial

112


-----

incentive from the COVID-19 closure period) were approximately 1% and 9% higher, respectively, than forward bookings
at the same point during financial year 2020.

Each village offers more than 150 leisure and spa related activities, along with on average 16 bars and restaurants
and 9 shops. Center Parcs generated 40.3%, 39.5% and 39.2% of its total revenue from on-site spend in financial years
2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The proportion of revenue from on-site spend in the 52-week periods ended
27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019 was broadly consistent with that in financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020.

**_Accommodation_**

Accommodation is a critical part of the overall guest experience at Center Parcs and the key financial driver,
representing 60.5% of total revenue, or £290.6 million, in financial year 2019 and 60.8% of total revenue, or £269.9 million,
in financial year 2020. As of 28 August 2020, Center Parcs offered 4,335 units of accommodation across its five villages.
Investment, maintenance and refurbishment are on-going to keep all accommodation up to date, fresh and contemporary.

Accommodation at each village comprises a range of one to four bedroom lodges (with six-bedroom lodges at
Sherwood Forest, Whinfell Forest and Woburn Forest), and luxury spa suits, one and two bedroom apartments and hotel
rooms, some of which include self-catering facilities. Each village offers a range of different grades of accommodation,
from entry level woodland units to exclusive lodges and treehouses with Jacuzzis, steam rooms and an assortment of
premium facilities, as well as a small number of apartments and hotel rooms. Center Parcs recently completed the upgrade
of all of its accommodation at the Original Villages and, following the upgrade of all existing units of accommodation,
Center Parcs has started a new cycle of refurbishment. 1,943 units of accommodation have been upgraded as of the date of
this Offering Memorandum under the current refurbishment cycle.

Between financial years 2007 and 2020, Center Parcs added over 230 new units of accommodation at the Original
Villages, in addition to the 706 units of accommodation added when Woburn Forest opened in 2014 together with 92
additional units at Woburn Forest following its opening. In addition, Center Parcs has planning permission to build a further
103 new units of accommodation. The new premium lodges are expected to include waterside lodges, apartments and other
executive lodges.

The following table shows a breakdown of the different grades of accommodation across Center Parcs’ villages
as of 28 August 2020.

**_Leisure Activities_**

Center Parcs offers more than 150 leisure and spa activities at each of its villages. These activities range from
passive and gentle to active and high adrenaline. Excluding the Aqua Sana spa, leisure activities comprised 11.7% of the
total revenue and 29.5% of total on-site revenue, or £56.0 million, in financial year 2019 and comprised 11.4% of the total
revenue and 29.0% of total on-site revenue, or £50.4 million, in financial year 2020.

_Sub-tropical Swimming Paradise_

The Sub-tropical swimming paradise is the core leisure offer of each Center Parcs village and is free to guests.
The pools are heated all year and have slides, water playgrounds for toddlers and a variety of other features, such as family
raft rides at Elveden Forest, Sherwood Forest and Woburn Forest. Across the five villages, the indoor water park averages
over 5,500 square metres in size, with an average capacity of over 1,400 people in the pool and changing areas. As at the
date of this Offering Memorandum, pool areas are operating at approximately 50% capacity due to COVID-19 after
reopening on 27 July 2020. Various additional activities are also available for a surcharge, including scuba diving and aqua
jetting. Guests can also hire a private cabana with seating, a television and complimentary soft drinks.

In 2011, Center Parcs commenced Project Atlantis, a strategic enhancement of its pool offer. The review covers
facility maintenance as well as opportunities to add new features. Project Atlantis is an investment capital expenditure
program pursuant to which approximately £38 million was spent between 2012 and 2020 at the Original Villages in order
to enhance the offering and guest experience. In autumn 2012, a new raft ride, the Tropical Cyclone, was introduced at
Elveden Forest and in June 2013, a family play area including numerous slides and water features was also opened at
Elveden Forest. These concepts, including high adrenaline raft rides and water slides, were included at Woburn Forest

-----

upon its opening in 2014 and extended to Longleat Forest in August 2017 and Sherwood Forest in 2019. The extension at
Sherwood Forest includes two new raft rides in addition to a new children’s play area.

_Outdoor Activities_

Outdoor activities offered by Center Parcs vary from adventure golf and nature walks to high adrenaline activities
such as high ropes, tree trekking and zip wires. All villages have a lake which offers a wide range of water sports and boats
for hire, including electric boats. All villages also provide access to a boathouse and beach, where paddle boats and
activities such as canoeing and sailing are on offer. All the villages have an outdoor activity centre providing activities
such as Segways®, archery, quad biking and laser combat. Sherwood Forest and Whinfell Forest also have nature centres
which allow guests to learn about the village’s wildlife as well as provide activities such as falconry, woodland walks and
educational tours. Center Parcs also offers festive-themed activities from November through the Christmas period as
villages are transformed into “Winter Wonderland”. Center Parcs’ focus on capacity management has enabled extra
sessions for guests, further increasing profitability. New outdoor activities recently introduced include zip wires, mini tree
trekking for younger children, woodland wheelers, off road explorers, a vertical drop challenge “The Drop”, an inflatable
“Aqua Parc” and a children’s boating experience “Mini Captain’s Adventure”.

_Indoor Activities_

Indoor activities include traditional activities, such as badminton, ten pin bowling, snooker, pool and table tennis,
all of which are consistently popular with guests and accordingly, have generated consistent revenue streams. Access to a
gymnasium and arcade are also available across all villages. Classes are offered for activities such as fencing and climbing.
Pottery painting was introduced initially at Longleat Forest in 2010 and has been rolled out to all villages. It caters to all
age groups and is a popular activity which has seen significant revenue growth.

Ten pin bowling is also a popular activity with guests. There are two bowling locations at Sherwood Forest and
Woburn Forest and one location at each other village.

New indoor activities more recently introduced include football pool and an “Indoor Climbing Adventure” which
has been introduced across all villages and expanded.

Center Parcs offers a wide range of activities tailored for children aged from six months to 14 years. Many such
activities are offered through the “Activity Den”. Trained staff offer a spectrum of activities, from traditional crèche and
soft play areas for toddlers to hair braiding and activities such as “Den Building” for older children and teenagers. In
addition to the “Activity Den”, classes for younger guests are offered in sports including football and cricket. Roller skating
and junior archery are also popular.

_Cycle Hire_

The car-free environment makes cycling a key feature of the Center Parcs experience. Each village has a fleet of
cycles. Center Parcs reviews its fleet regularly and invests significantly in new ranges of cycles to replace older models. In
line with the initiative to pre-book more activities, pre-booking of cycles represented more than half of total cycle bookings
in financial year 2018, reducing queuing times and improving planning.

_Aqua Sana — Spa and Treatments_

The award-winning Aqua Sana spa is open to outside guests as well as to village guests, with most bookings made
in advance and pre-paid prior to arrival. Aqua Sana comprised 5.6% of total revenue and 14.2% of total on-site revenue,
or £26.9 million, in financial year 2019 and comprised 5.7% of total revenue and 14.6% of total on-site revenue, or £25.4
million, in financial year 2020.

Each village has between 15 and 25 treatment rooms and extensive spa facilities with a variety of different
“experience rooms”, hydrotherapy pools, saunas and meditation areas. Treatments range from massage through to more
advanced facials and beauty treatments for both men and women.

Aqua Sana facilities have benefited from on-going refurbishment and upgrades, with approximately £7.4 million
invested in the last three financial years. Retail shops offer a wide variety of beauty products from well-known brands,
including Elemis and Decleor. The Aqua Sana offer at all villages includes a “Vitalé Café Bar” food and beverage offer
serving light meals and refreshments. In 2017, Center Parcs launched the refurbished Aqua Sana spa with a total capital
expenditure of more than £3 million. In January 2020, Center Parcs completed a £6.5 million upgrade of the Aqua Sana
spa in Longleat Forest. The Aqua Sana spas at Whinfell Forest, Woburn Forest and Sherwood Forest were shortlisted for
the 2019 Good Spa Awards, and Aqua Sana Sherwood Forest was awarded Best Destination Spa in November 2019. Aqua
Sana Sherwood Forest had previously been awarded Best Spa in the East Midlands and the East in November 2018.

115


-----

A new concept of spa suites was introduced at Elveden Forest in 2011. They provide a package of an overnight
stay combined with access to the Aqua Sana. Four units were opened and unlike other accommodation can be booked on
a nightly basis. Woburn Forest opened with six spa suite units and a further two have been subsequently added.

Revenue from outside guests has been an area of growth, comprising 43% of Aqua Sana revenue in financial
year 2020. The business continues to work towards ensuring the right offer for both village guests and outside guests.

Online booking is available for Aqua Sana and a new website was introduced in December 2016. Aqua Sana
receives dedicated operational and sales and marketing support. Center Parcs will continue to refurbish and upgrade
facilities and invest in system enhancements at the Aqua Sana spas.

_Conference Facilities_

Sherwood Forest, Elveden Forest, Longleat Forest and Woburn Forest offer purpose built conference and meeting
facilities. Woburn Forest provides the largest conference facilities and can accommodate up to 400 delegates. Each of the
villages offers an extensive range of leisure activities, which can be used during conferences for teambuilding purposes,
such as raft building, tree trekking or aerial adventures. The use of these conference and meeting facilities are booked
through Center Parcs’ Corporate Events division. Following the closure of Center Parcs’ villages due to COVID-19, Center
Parcs does not expect conference facilities to be available to guests for the remainder of the calendar year 2020.

**_On-site Food and Beverage_**

Center Parcs seeks to provide its guests with an extensive range of dining experiences, with on-site food and
beverage sales comprising 16.3% of total revenue and 41.3% of total on-site revenue, or £78.2 million, in financial year
2019 and comprising 16.3% of total revenue and 41.7% of total on-site revenue, or £72.5 million, in financial year 2020.

Each village has an average of 16 restaurants and bars. This provides a choice of restaurants, some targeted at
families, with play areas and children’s menus while others offer premium dining. Center Parcs believes that these on-site
food and beverage facilities are popular with its guests and have enabled higher sustained pricing and limited promotional
activity compared with restaurants located on high streets. Menus are reviewed regularly and restaurants have been
refurbished and upgraded on a rolling cycle to ensure that standards and the experience are maintained to a high standard.
In financial years 2016 to 2020, Center Parcs carried out major refurbishments at “Sports Café” at Sherwood Forest,
Whinfell Forest, Longleat Forest and Elveden Forest, “Leisure Bowl” at Longleat Forest and Elveden Forest and “Huck’s”
at Sherwood Forest, Elveden Forest, Longleat Forest and Whinfell Forest and “Rajinda Pradesh” at Whinfell Forest.

Concession partners operate certain outlets and account for approximately one third of on-site spend on food and
beverage. Approximately one-third of the outlets are operated under a concession agreement with The Big Table. Under
this concession agreement, the concession fees payable by The Big Table to Center Parcs is the greater of a set minimum
fee or a specified percentage of their respective revenue. Current revenue generated by The Big Table is above the minimum
guaranteed. Concession partners bring industry operational expertise to Center Parcs and have brought high street brand
names such as Café Rouge, Las Iguanas, Strada and Bella Italia to the villages.

The food and beverage offer includes the following:

    - Starbucks is operated as a franchise in all villages under licence, with 13 units in operation as of the date
of this Offering Memorandum;

    - Café Rouge (all villages), Bella Italia (Elveden Forest, Whinfell Forest, Sherwood Forest and Longleat
Forest), Strada (Woburn Forest only) and Las Iguanas (Longleat Forest and Woburn Forest) are managed

revenue and 15.0% of total on-site revenue, or £28.5 million, in financial year 2019 and comprised 5.7% of total revenue
and 14.7% of total on-site revenue, or £25.5 million, in financial year 2020.

The retail outlets have been designed to complement the activities at Center Parcs and the requirements of its
guests. Each village has an average of eight main retail outlets and a number of satellite retail offers.

The on-site supermarket, the ParcMarket, provides guests with a full range of products comparable to a high street
convenience store for guests’ self-catering requirements. The shop includes a range of fresh foods, fresh breads and pastries
baked on-site, and a wide range of wines, beers and spirits as well as a comprehensive grocery offer. Prices are monitored
against comparably sized outlets in the surrounding areas.

Each village also has a confectionery shop, a gift shop with a wide variety of gifts and souvenirs and a toy store
catering for children of all ages. There is also a shop within the cycle centre.

Since 2008, the Nuance Group has been Center Parcs’ strategic retail partner. The Nuance Group’s management
of these retail units has allowed Center Parcs to develop a partnership with an operator with a well-established retail
network. The presence of the concession partners enables guests to benefit from high street brand offerings and Center
Parcs to leverage industry expertise. Approximately two-thirds of all retail shops at Center Parcs are currently operated
under concession agreements with the Nuance Group.

Whinfell Forest generated £85 million in revenue and £41 million Adjusted EBITDA.

_Location_

119


-----

The property is located between Penrith and Temple Sowerby on the A66. Penrith is the closest town (population
approximately 15,000) and is approximately four miles west of the village.

_Transport Links_

The M6 motorway is approximately seven miles to the west of the village, providing motorway access to Scotland
and the northwest of England, as well as to the Midlands and the south of England. The closest rail facilities are located in
Penrith, which provides connections to major centres, including Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and
London.

_Catchment Area_

Whinfell Forest is the most northerly of the Center Parcs’ villages and it therefore tends to attract guests from
Scotland, the north of England and north Wales. The main catchment areas include Glasgow and the west coast of Scotland,
Newcastle and the north east, Liverpool, Manchester and the North West. However, due to the proximity of the village to
the Lake District, this facility also has a higher proportion of long distance guests.

_Tenure_

The property is held under three separate titles - one being freehold and two being long leasehold. The leasehold
titles are held under two leases scheduled to expire in 2120 for a total passing rental of £1,000 per annum. A premium of
£3,288,500 (plus VAT) was previously paid in instalments for one lease, and a premium of £112,000 was paid in respect
of the other lease.

**_Woburn Forest_**

The fifth village in Center Parcs’ portfolio comprises approximately 357 acres of mature forested land in Woburn,
Bedfordshire and was opened to paying guests on 6 June 2014. Woburn Forest was built with the same core offer as the
Original Villages but introduced modern and contemporary accommodation designs and has a higher proportion of
premium accommodation offerings. As of 13 July 2020, Woburn Forest had 800 units of accommodation comprising 717
lodges, a 75 room hotel and 8 spa suites. There are 415 units of executive accommodation, representing 52.0% of the total,
a higher percentage than any other village. This is designed to service the anticipated demand of its affluent guest base in
the south of England.

As part of a further development phase, 57 additional premium and executive lodges opened in autumn 2017,
three treehouses opened in July 2018, 12 lodges opened during financial year 2020 and two lodges opened during financial
year 2021.

In financial year 2019, Woburn Forest generated £95 million in revenue and £50 million Adjusted EBITDA. In
financial year 2020, Woburn Forest generated £87 million in revenue and £42 million Adjusted EBITDA.

_Location_

Woburn Forest is located approximately 60 miles north of London in Bedfordshire.

_Transport Links_

Woburn Forest is six miles from the M1 motorway. The village also has convenient rail links, with a journey time
of 45 minutes by train from London St. Pancras to Flitwick train station, located approximately two miles away.

_Catchment Area_

Woburn Forest is the only Center Parcs village within a 90-minute drive time of London households. Woburn
Forest also has the highest volume of core target households within that drive time. For much of this population, the
penetration for Center Parcs has historically been low.

_Tenure_

The property is held in leasehold title under the terms of a lease with Woburn Estate Company Limited and
Bedford Estates Nominees Limited. The term of the lease is 99 years from 24 December 2010 for a current passing rent of
£641,412 (payable from March 2018) per annum. A premium of £3,540,600 was paid to the lessor. The lease contains a
rent review clause with an upwards only review to take place every 5 years (with the next review due on 31 March 2023)
by reference to the greater of an increase in rent in line with the retail price index, a fixed percentage increase in the passing
rent or the historic increase in revenue at Woburn Forest.

**_Village Development_**

120


-----

The first step in the development of a new Center Parcs village is the identification of an appropriate site. There
are limited appropriate sites for villages as the Center Parcs’ model requires large forested areas near major population
centres. Following the identification of the site, planning permits for the development of the village need to be obtained.
The development of a new village has a long lead time due to the stringent requirements for these permits. In addition, a
wide range of specialised operations and planning expertise are required to develop a new village, including cost plans and
budgets as well as studies assessing the economic, geological and ecological impact of the new village. The planning phase
is followed by tender and procurement processes for the construction. These processes are then followed by the actual
construction and pre-opening training of village staff.

There are significant costs associated with the development of a village. For example, the development cost for
Woburn Phase 1 was approximately £250 million. The actual building of the village involved the construction of 706 units
of accommodation in addition to the Village Square, the Indoor Plaza, the Subtropical Swimming Paradise and other
activity and leisure areas. Center Parcs estimates that the current cost of developing a new village would be approximately
£350 million.

In July 2019, Center Parcs opened its sixth village, Longford Forest, in County Longford in the Republic of
Ireland. Longford Forest is Center Parcs’ first village outside of the United Kingdom. Longford Forest is outside of the
Obligor Group. The 400-acre Longford Forest village includes 466 lodges and 30 apartments, which can accommodate
approximately 2,700 guests, more than 100 indoor and outdoor family activities including the Subtropical Swimming
Paradise and the Aqua Sana spa and a range of restaurants and shops. The development of Longford Forest cost
approximately €265 million. Center Parcs believes the development of Longford Forest resulted in the creation of
approximately 750 jobs during the construction and approximately 1,000 permanent jobs after Longford Forest’s opening.

**Village Operations**

**_Operational Management_**

Each of Center Parcs’ villages is managed by a Village Director and a deputy Village Director, who oversee the
events manager, guest services manager and on-village revenue manager. Other individuals responsible for the
management of the village are the technical services manager, housekeeping manager, leisure services manager, village
financial controller, human resources manager, security manager, village duty managers and food and beverage manager.
As of 27 April 2020, Center Parcs had an average of approximately 1,677 employees at each village. Center Parcs’ villages
are akin to small towns with their own infrastructure, including gas, water and power provision.

One of the key focus points of village operations is guest satisfaction. 96% of guests rated their break as
“excellent” or “good” in financial year 2020. Center Parcs uses the “Delivering Excellent Service” metric to measure
service provision across offerings. Guest feedback, particularly the monitoring of “Delivering Excellent Service” scores
through guest surveys, forms a central part of the internal review and improvement process for each village. Each operating
unit at a village has target “Delivering Excellent Service” scores as part of its bonus schemes.

**_Risk Management_**

Each village’s Village Director is supported by an independent health and safety team at the head office. Each
village has regular risk meetings throughout the year. Center Parcs’ risk management policy focuses on health and safety
including guest safety, food safety, lodge safety, employee safety, fire safety and child protection. Center Parcs also
centrally monitors enterprise risk and key performance indicators.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs has taken extensive steps to mitigate the risk of infection,
including social distancing and enhanced cleaning measures, and remains focused on keeping guests and employees safe
and ensuring Center Parcs’ compliance with UK government health and safety regulations. Center Parcs expects to
undertake ongoing risk management and compliance efforts as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.

**_Supply Chain_**

Center Parcs primarily has a centralised procurement function to ensure quality, competitiveness, regulatory and
ethical policy compliance, continuity and consistency across its five villages. Center Parcs mainly uses national suppliers
that service all five villages, ensuring economies of scale and commercial leverage, and therefore controlling overall costs.
Center Parcs’ villages also use local suppliers for certain goods and services to ensure provenance and speed of service as
well as to support corporate social responsibility initiatives. Altogether, Center Parcs manages approximately 1,400
suppliers centrally and purchased approximately £154 million of goods and services in financial year 2020. Center Parcs
has a dedicated sourcing team focusing on utilities, food and beverage, fixtures, fittings and inventory, technical and ground
services, laundry services and leisure goods and services.

**_Guest Profile_**

121


-----

Over 90% of the UK population lives within a 2.5 hour drive of at least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and the
majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two hour drive of the village they choose to visit.

In the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, 80% of Center Parcs’ guests were families, with families with
pre-school children, families with school age children and families with mixed age children comprising 31%, 28% and
21% of all guests, respectively.

According to management estimates, Center Parcs ranked significantly over index in a number of the Experian
high end consumer classifications, with 57% of guests in financial year 2019 were identified under the Experian Mosaic
classification as “Domestic Success”, “Prestige Positions” or “Aspiring Homemakers” based on postcode analysis.

**_Marketing_**

Center Parcs is positioned as a relatively upmarket, high quality short-break holiday option for affluent families
wanting to spend time together, away from the stresses and routine of everyday life. Brand value and integrity underlies
Center Parcs’ marketing strategy.

Center Parcs engages directly with guests, with approximately 87% of bookings made online in financial year
2020 and the remaining through its in-house contact centre. Center Parcs does not deal with online affiliates or travel
agents. As such, there are no commission payments made to third parties selling Center Parcs to consumers.

Center Parcs’ accommodation pricing strategy is based on a dynamic demand driven model, where prices start at
a low level in order to generate demand and generally rise as sales increase along with demand as the short-break holiday
dates approach. This approach rewards and encourages early booking (Center Parcs has an 18-month booking horizon) and
has helped Center Parcs increase revenues through economic cycles and has allowed it to maintain and improve occupancy
rates. This is reflected in “intention to return” scores of 95% in financial year 2020.

The dynamic demand-driven pricing model, overseen by its dedicated pricing team, enables management to
optimise accommodation revenues by linking price to demand throughout the year. The pricing model utilises granular
data, mapping holidays by length of break, accommodation type (with over 180 different types across the villages for the
purposes of the pricing model), time of year as well as by village and incorporates the previous year’s average price as a
base, adjusted for inflation and other factors (including the time of week, whether the period is peak or off-peak and high
occupancy versus quieter occupancy periods). This allows Center Parcs to smooth out its pricing across the seasons, adapt
its accommodation pricing to guest demand and facilitate its yield management. Prices are reviewed daily and any changes
can be updated on the Center Parcs website within 30 minutes. Any prices can be benchmarked against other villages, to
adapt the progression of bookings against the expected booking profile.

Center Parcs’ on-site pricing is generally less variable than its accommodation pricing. All activities except for
the Subtropical Swimming Paradise are booked on a pay-per-use principle, and all activities are available for pre-booking.
In the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, more than 64% of on-site activities were pre-booked and pre-paid. Center
Parcs maintains clear price lists for its activities to increase transparency.

Center Parcs maintains a guest database of approximately 309,000 active guests as of 7 July 2020 (i.e. those who
had a Center Parcs break in the last 26 months or have an active booking). Over 34% of guests return within 14 months,
and approximately 54% return within five years. Given the cost effectiveness of targeting guests who have previously
stayed at a Center Parcs village, a significant proportion of the Center Parcs marketing budget is focused on communicating
with its existing guest base, targeting repeat visits and the sale of on-site activities. When making a booking all guests
create a Center Parcs account, which allows them to store their information and party details and simplify their ongoing
booking process with Center Parcs. This is also an opportunity for Center Parcs to track and analyse data for insight over
time. The retention strategy focuses on an email programme that maintains communication with guests, from initial enquiry
for information, through booking of accommodation, pre-arrival booking of activities, to the post-visit Welcome Home
and Anniversary emails. Constantly evolving communications methods in line with consumer behaviour, Center Parcs are
moving to eradicate paper communications. Recently the Village Life magazine was moved to an online digital
communication rather than paper, with content complementing the ongoing lifestyle blog, “Under The Treetops”. A series
of pre-arrival emails to guests encourages them to plan and book their itinerary of activities and restaurant bookings well
in advance and, again, this has moved to be purely via digital channels. In addition, Center Parcs constantly monitors ongoing guest feedback through its online guest service questionnaire, which has been completed by approximately 33% of
guests in financial year 2020, as well as through various quantitative and qualitative research projects (including surveys
and focus groups), website behavioural tracking and social media reporting and monitoring to review the various elements
of its business. Guest questionnaires are also exclusively online delivering industry-leading response percentages and
therefore rich guest feedback. Such research helps guide marketing communications, and has also been the basis of
improvements in both guest service and product development (for example, accommodation refurbishment, pool upgrades,

122


-----

new leisure activities and software developments). Center Parcs also offers a “come back soon” price guarantee to guests
when they leave thus incentivising guests to return and quickly rebook within a month of their visit.

In addition to its retention strategy, Center Parcs integrates acquisition marketing activities across a mix of
available marketing channels such as TV, radio, web, email, newspapers and magazines, outdoor and social media, all
aimed primarily towards a more affluent market to bring in new affluent guests that have the potential to provide repeat
business and good lifetime value through multiple return visits. Typically, Center Parcs runs an integrated cross-channel
media campaign, led by television and internet advertising and search, supplemented by email, social media and other
forms of public relations activities, all of which are seasonally, geographically and demographically targeted for optimal
effects. The largest spend of the year is focused upon the key booking period from late December through to late February,
when large numbers of UK consumers are in the market for holidays and short-breaks and the propensity to book is higher.

Center Parcs operates a service programme called “Delivering Excellent Service” to enhance the level of service
it provides to its guests. All staff have been trained under the Making Memorable Moments Programme. This effort has
yielded improved results, as measured by responses to guest questionnaires.

**Information Technology**

Center Parcs’ has a modern information technology platform utilising proprietary and third-party hardware and
software, including market-standard booking and customer relationship management tools, firewalls and data protection
mechanisms, off-site servers, and dedicated on-site IT staff. Center Parcs uses price variability between seasons and across
villages in order to respond to changes in demand, local economic conditions, and guest spending profiles.

Center Parcs maintains a sophisticated customer database with fully integrated accommodation and on-site spend
data, designed to improve customer analytics, full social media and customer relationship management and a robust online
platform recognising individuals and profile segments. As a result, Center Parcs is building the future opportunity to (i)
improve its ability to identify and target the most profitable guest profiles and customer lifetime value; (ii) develop and
facilitate access to guest data for guest-facing service departments and provide more targeted guest services, such as
differentiating between first-time guests and repeat guests and recognising differing family make ups, such as children’s
ages; (iii) boost individual guest identification indicating individual preferences to enable Center Parcs to better tailor guest
services; and (iv) allow for an improved user booking experience by providing a seamless, consistent and more responsive
process across its booking systems.

**_Bookings Systems_**

Center Parcs’ pre-arrivals booking systems comprise a telephone-based in-house contact centre and an online
service via its website. Center Parcs significantly improved cost efficiency and efficiency of email and call handling
through the consolidation of its call centre operations to its head office in 2010. Guests are able to book leisure activities
in advance through these booking systems. In addition to benefiting guests, these pre-arrivals booking systems help
optimise yield management and give Center Parcs greater planning time to ensure it meets demand through extra
sessions/capacity. A dedicated revenue management team ensures that accommodation demand and capacity are constantly
monitored to ensure revenue optimisation. In financial year 2020, more than 64% of activities were pre-booked and prepaid prior to arrival. All bookings are made directly with Center Parcs, with approximately 87% of accommodation
bookings made online in financial year 2020. Guests can book either online (using Center Parcs’ website or mobile site) or
on-site using purpose built on-site booking points.

(1) As of 23 April 2020, approximately 90% of Center Parcs employees were furloughed pursuant to the UK government’s CJRS.

As of 19 June 2020, 42% of the Group’s employees were housekeepers, 20% of employees were employed in
leisure activities and 24% of employees were employed in food and beverage outlets.

Center Parcs is a large local employer in the locations where it operates and its strong brand awareness helps it
attract new employees. Center Parcs uses a centralised online recruitment system, in addition to references from current
employees. All new employees go through an induction programme that introduces them to Center Parcs’ customer service
initiatives. Employees also have access to on-the-job training including a management training course for employees
looking to transition into management roles. Center Parcs also offers apprenticeships, diploma courses and over 200
technical and professional courses each year to its employees.

**Maintenance and Inspection**

Center Parcs uses both planned preventative maintenance and reactive maintenance regimes to ensure that its
accommodation, facilities, amenities, plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings are inspected and maintained to a standard
acceptable to its target guest base.

124


-----

The planned preventative maintenance regime helps to ensure that Center Parcs has visibility of the total cost of
maintaining its assets and the cost of replacing end of life assets. The reactive maintenance regime ensures that Center
Parcs has a technical services team on call to attend to any maintenance issue 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The technical
services teams are complimented by external experts, technicians and engineers as required.

The Director of Operations and the senior management team of each village meet regularly. The Director of
Operations and CEO undertake an annual inspection of standards and maintenance related issues and there is an annual
asset review undertaken with the CEO, Development Director, Head of Assets, Director of Operations and Village Director.

**Insurance**

Center Parcs maintains insurance of the types it believes to be commercially reasonable and available to businesses
in its industry, and in amounts exceeding the statutory minimums. It maintains insurance policies that provide coverage for
property related risks, business interruption following loss of or damage to property, employers’ liability and public and
product liability.

Center Parcs’ current insurance policies expire on 30 June of each year. While insurance premiums have remained
relatively stable over recent years, Center Parcs expects its insurance premiums to increase materially as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, including those for directors and officers insurance, public liability insurance, employers’ liability
insurance and travel insurance. Center Parcs cannot predict the level of the premiums it may be required to pay for
subsequent insurance coverage or the level of insurance available.

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, Center Parcs has been and is involved in disputes and litigation related to its business and
operations.

In particular, the nature of the leisure activities which it provides and the industry in which it operates tend to
expose Center Parcs to claims by guests for personal injuries. Center Parcs investigates such claims thoroughly and,
depending on the circumstances, will settle or defend the claim accordingly. Center Parcs may also be subject to
investigations and prosecution for alleged violations of health and safety laws and regulations. For example, Center Parcs
was party to proceedings involving an alleged health and safety violation in connection with an employee injured on site
at Woburn Forest in 2014. In March 2018, Center Parcs was party to proceedings involving an alleged health and safety
violation in connection with a guest’s injury at Woburn Forest in 2015. As of 13 July 2020, these disputes have been
resolved and related costs paid.

Center Parcs is not currently party to any actual or threatened legal proceedings or disputes which may have a
material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.

**Regulation and Environment**

The villages operated by Center Parcs are subject to a number of national and local laws relating to the operation
of holiday breaks, including those regarding the sale of alcohol and offering of entertainment. Operating in forested areas
with endangered wildlife, the villages are also required to adhere to strict environmental codes.

Center Parcs’ operations are subject to increasingly stringent national and local environmental laws and
regulations, including laws and regulations governing air and noise emissions; wastewater and storm water discharges and
uses; oil spillages; the maintenance of storage tanks and the use, release, storage, disposal, handling and transportation of,
and exposure to, chemicals and hazardous substances; and otherwise relating to health, safety and the protection of the
environment and natural resources and the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs’ operations have been and may continue to be subject to
additional regulations, including health and safety requirements such as required social distancing, use of personal
protective equipment, and mandatory closure of certain activities. Center Parcs has implemented these regulations as well
as increased cleaning of communal areas and touch points (door handles, handrails, table tops etc), order and pay
technology to reduce face to face interactions and cashless to remove payment by notes and coins. Center Parcs has also
benefited from UK governmental support initiatives, such as the CJRS, the VAT reduction and business rates’ holiday. See
_“Risk Factors—The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect Center Parcs’_
_business, financial condition and results of operations” and “Risk Factors—Governmental regulation may adversely affect_
_Center Parcs’ existing and future operations and results” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results Of Operations—The COVID-19 pandemic.”_

Center Parcs is subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to its relationship with its employees, including
minimum wage requirements, child labour laws, health benefits, and overtime and working condition requirements. In
addition, Center Parcs is subject to the Equality Act 2010.

Center Parcs was the first UK organisation to receive the Wildlife Trust’s “Biodiversity Benchmark” across all
of its sites, with all of the villages retaining their certification as of October 2018.

Committee. Center Parcs’ Data Protection Governance Committee meets quarterly to consider and review data protection
risks and issues, including significant new projects or data breaches, and is chaired by the HR and Commercial Services
Director.

Center Parcs has a team of internal auditors based across all five villages that operates independently from
village operations. The audit team looks at trends across the business to ensure that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit the preparation of financial statements. Before the commencement of each financial year, the directors and
senior management are consulted to prepare an audit plan for the year, highlighting areas that raise concern. Audits are
then performed at each village by the team of internal auditors and the resulting report is circulated to the directors.
Recommendations arising from the reports are discussed with the relevant management personnel to ensure that controls
are improved in a manner that results in efficient and secure procedures.

**Management Employment Contracts**

CP Opco also grants CP Ireland a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable and perpetual
licence to use and reproduce any brands or trademarks owned or licensed by CP Opco and used by any of the existing
villages (including the core “Center Parcs” brand and trademarks) for the purposes of running the business of Longford
Forest which is described in further detail below. This IP licence is terminable only in certain limited circumstances as
described below.

The Longford Management Services Agreement, but not the licence of the intellectual property rights, may be
terminated in the following circumstances: (i) if CP Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates, by either CP Opco or CP
Ireland providing two years’ written notice; and (ii) by either CP Opco or CP Ireland for non-payment, subject to an
aggregate grace period for payment of 15 days. If CP Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates, CP Opco may terminate
the Longford Management Services Agreement and the licence of the intellectual property rights by written notice if CP
Ireland does or omits to do anything which causes a material adverse effect to the value of the core “Center Parcs” brand
and trademarks (taken as a whole). In addition, if CP Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates: (i) CP Ireland may
terminate the licence of the intellectual property rights only by six months’ written notice and (ii) CP Opco may
terminate the licence of the intellectual property rights only by three months’ written notice if CP Ireland ceases to brand

Management Services Agreement) licence whereas the licence of the trademarks (which includes the core Center Parcs

villages) is a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable (subject to the terms of the Longford Management Services
Agreement) and (unless terminated in accordance with the Longford Management Services Agreement) irrevocable and
perpetual licence.

Where a notice of termination has been served by CP Opco due to CP Ireland doing or omitting to do anything
which causes a material adverse effect on the value of the core “Center Parcs” brand and trademarks (taken as a whole)
the licence of the intellectual property rights will terminate on the date on which CP Ireland receives the written notice of
termination whereas, in respect of the other provisions of the Longford Management Services Agreement, CP Opco shall
provide exit services to CP Ireland for a period of 12 months from the date of the written notice of termination. If CP
Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates and either CP Opco or CP Ireland provides two years’ written notice to the
other to terminate, CP Opco shall provide exit services to CP Ireland for six months prior to the end of the two year
notice period. Such exit services include the handover of data (to the extent permitted by law) required to honour future
bookings of Longford Forest and market to past and existing guests of Longford Forest and assistance with the handover
or replacement of third party supplier contracts, shared IT services and equipment, payroll and HR systems, and the
phasing out of the use of CP Opco’s intellectual property rights. The exit services will be provided in return for a service
charge of a sum equal to CP Opco’s cost of providing the exit services, such amount being increased by 20% if CP Opco
and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates. At any time when exit services are provided, CP Opco and CP Ireland will not be
affiliates and the termination events which lead to CP Opco being required to provide exit services only apply once CP
Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following summary of the material terms of the Class A2 Notes, the Class A4 Notes, the Class A5 Notes,_
_the Liquidity Facility Agreement, Topco Payment Undertaking, Topco Share Security Agreement and CP Cayman_
_Security Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the_
_underlying documents._

**Class A Notes**

The Issuer issued the Class A2 Notes on the Closing Date and issued the Initial Class A4 Notes on the Second
Issue Date. On the Fourth Closing Date, the Issuer issued the Further Class A4 Notes, which were consolidated and form
a single series with the Initial Class A4 Notes, following the date on which the Temporary Global Note issued in respect
of the Further Class A4 Notes was exchanged for the Permanent Global Note representing the Class A4 Notes. On the
Fifth Closing Date, the Issuer issued the Second Further Class A4 Notes, which were consolidated and form a single
series with the Initial Class A4 Notes and the Further Class A4 Notes, and the Class A5 Notes. The Second Further Class
A4 Notes, together with the Further Class A4 Notes and the Initial Class A4 Notes are referred to as the “Class A4
**Notes”. The Class A2 Notes, the Class A4 Notes and the Class A5 Notes are referred to as the “Class A Notes”.**

On the Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Class A2 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make an
advance to the Original Borrowers pursuant to the terms of the Original Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in an
aggregate principal amount of £440.0 million (the “Class A2 Loan”). On the Second Closing Date, the proceeds of the
issue of the Initial Class A4 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make an advance to the Borrowers pursuant to the terms
of an amended and restated Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (the “First Amended and Restated Class A
**IBLA”) in an aggregate principal amount of £140.0 million (the “Initial Class A4 Loan”). On the Fourth Closing Date,**
the proceeds of the issue of the Further Class A4 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make an advance to the Borrowers
pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (the “Second Amended and
**Restated Class A IBLA”) in an aggregate principal amount of £100.0 million (the “Further Class A4 Loan”). On the**
Fifth Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Second Further Class A4 Notes and the Class A5 Notes were applied
by the Issuer to make two advances to the Borrowers pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (the “Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement” or the “Class A IBLA”) in an
aggregate principal amount of (x) £100.0 million in respect of the Second Further Class A4 Notes (the “Second **Further**
**Class A4 Loan” which was consolidated with the Initial Class A4 Loan and the Further Class A4 Loan and together**
designated the “Class A4 Loan”) and (y) £379.5 million in respect of the Class A5 Notes (the “Class A5 Loan”).

The Original Borrowers used the Class A2 Loan to refinance existing debt facilities (and the payment of related
fees and expenses), and for general corporate purposes. The Borrowers used the Class A3 Loan and the Initial Class A4
Loan to refinance the loan of £300,000,000 (the “Class A1 Loan”) advanced by the Issuer to the Borrowers under the
Class A Issuer/Borrower Facility and for the purchase of CP Woburn Opco. The Borrowers used the Further Class A4
Loan, together with the proceeds of the Class B3 Loan and the Class B4 Loan to (i) repay the Class B2 Loan (including
the payment of any prepayment premium and any accrued and unpaid interest); (ii) make a distribution out of the
Restricted Group, the proceeds of which were used to fund the development of Longford Forest, Center Parcs’ sixth
village in County Longford, Republic of Ireland; (iii) make a distribution to shareholders; and (iv) pay fees, costs and
expenses related to the transactions. The Borrowers used the Second Further Class A4 Loan and the Class A5 Loan to
(i) repay the loan of £350,000,000 (the “Class A3 Loan”) advanced by the Issuer to the Borrowers under the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Facility (including the payment of any prepayment premium and any accrued and unpaid interest); (ii) to
make a distribution to shareholders, (iii) to pay fees, costs and expenses related to those transactions; and (iv) for general
corporate purposes.

The economic terms and conditions of the Class A2 Loan, the Class A4 Loan, and the Class A5 Loan
(together, the “Class A Loans”) (including, among other things, in relation to the payment of interest and the repayment
and prepayment of principal) are broadly similar to the economic terms and conditions of the Class A2 Notes, the Class
A4 Notes, and the Class A5 Notes, respectively.

The obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Class A Notes will rank equally in respect of security and as to
payment of interest and repayment and prepayment of principal but in priority to the obligations of the Issuer in respect

**Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement**

**_Repayments and Prepayments_**

The Class A2 Loan Expected Maturity Date is 23 February 2024 (the “Class A2 Loan Expected Maturity
**Date” or the “Class A2 EMD”), the Class A4 Loan Expected Maturity Date is 22 August 2025 (the “Class A4 Loan**
**Expected Maturity Date” or the “Class A4 EMD”), and the Class A5 Loan Expected Maturity Date is 23 August 2028**
(the “Class A5 Loan Expected Maturity Date” or the “Class A5 EMD”). The Borrower must repay each of the
Class A2 Loan and the Class A4 Loans in full on 25 February 2042 and the Class A5 Loan in full on 25 February 2047,
to the extent not repaid, prepaid or otherwise discharged in full prior to that date.

In certain circumstances the Borrowers will be required to prepay the Class A Loans in full, including if it has
become unlawful for the Issuer or the Borrower to perform any of their respective obligations under the relevant
documents or if a Borrower is, or will be, required to pay to the Issuer a tax payment as a result of a change in law or in
any published practice or concession of any relevant tax authority.

In addition, the Borrowers may, by giving the relevant notice to the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee,
voluntarily prepay (or ensure that a Borrower prepays) all or part (if applicable) of any outstanding Class A Loan
provided that certain conditions are satisfied.

**_Representations_**

The Class A IBLA has standard representations and warranties made by each Obligor. These representations
include (subject, in some cases, to agreed exceptions and qualifications as to materiality and reservations of law) the
following representations:

(a) its due incorporation, valid existence, power and authority to own its assets and carry on its
business as it is being conducted;

(b) it has the power to enter into and perform the senior finance documents;

(c) it has not breached any judgment, law, regulation, order or decree applicable to it;

(d) its obligations under the senior finance documents are legal, valid, binding and enforceable;

(f) no litigation, arbitration or administrative proceedings against any member of the Obligor Group
has been started or, to its knowledge, threatened;

(g) it has a good, valid marketable title to, or valid leases or licences of, and all appropriate
authorisation to use, the assets necessary for it to carry on its business as presently conducted at
each of the properties except for non-material defects;

(h) no insolvency event has occurred and is continuing in relation to it;

(i) there are no agreements, arrangements or resolutions with any of its affiliates which: (i) call for a
further issue or allotment of any share or loan note (or any equivalent by), or for the benefit of, an
Obligor; or (ii) allow any other person to directly participate in the Obligor Group’s profits;

(j) matters relating to insurances;

(k) no contingent liabilities or commitments not disclosed in relevant financial statements;

(l) matters relating to centre of main interest;

(m) matter relating to intellectual property rights; and

(n) absence of litigation, arbitration or administrative proceedings.

134


-----

**_Security_**

The obligations of the Obligors under the Class A IBLA are secured by the Obligors in favour of HSBC
Corporate Trustee Company (UK) Limited (the “Borrower Security Trustee”) for the benefit of the borrower secured
creditors by way of fixed and floating charges created by a borrower deed of charge (the “Borrower Deed of Charge”)
and by a deed of charge entered into by CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited (the “Woburn Deed of Charge”, and
together with the Borrower Deed of Charge, the “Class A Borrower Deed of Charge”). The security from each of the
Obligors include first-ranking mortgages or first fixed charges over their freehold and leasehold interests in the villages,
their bank accounts and the share capital of their subsidiaries.

**_Financial Covenants_**

In addition to the general covenants described below, the Class A IBLA contains a financial covenant that
requires the Borrowers to maintain a ratio (expressed as a percentage) of free cash flow to class A total debt service
charges (the “Class A FCF DSCR”) equal to or greater than 110% on each Financial Covenant Test Date. The
Borrowers will have the benefit of certain cure rights in the event that the Class A FCF DSCR is less than 110%.

Following the approval of the Class A Consent Solicitation, a waiver has been granted with respect to the
requirement to comply with the Class A FCF DSCR covenant for the Financial Covenant Test Dates falling in August
2020, February 2021 and August 2021; and, assuming that the extraordinary resolution is approved by the Class A
Noteholders under the Class A Consent Solicitation, the basis on which the Class A FCF DSCR covenant is calculated
for the purposes of the Financial Covenant Test Date falling in February 2022 will be amended to ensure that such
calculation is not adversely affected by any enforced closure of or operational restrictions in respect of the holiday
villages during the 12-month look-back period in respect of the Financial Covenant Test Date falling in February 2022.

Following the approval of the Class A Consent Solicitation, if on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the
Obligors fail to pay the full amount due on such date in respect of the Class B Loans, the waivers and/or amendments in
respect of the Class A FCF DSCR covenant will cease to have any effect, with effect from the day immediately preceding
the Financial Covenant Test Date occurring prior to such Loan Interest Payment Date.

**_Class A Restricted Payments_**

The Class A IBLA prohibits any Obligor from, at any time, making any payment of dividend, or other
distribution in respect of shares, or any redemption in respect of share capital, or any repayment of principal or payment
of interest in respect of any financial indebtedness owed by an Obligor to an entity that is not an Obligor, or granting a
loan in cash or in kind, or any purchase of any debt owed by an Obligor to an entity which is not an Obligor (such
restricted payment a “Class A Restricted Payment”) to any entity that is an affiliate of the Borrower group but not an
Obligor at any time unless the Class A Restricted Payment Condition (as defined below) was satisfied as at the most
recent date which is seven Business Days before each loan interest payment date (the “Financial Covenant Test Date”).

Following the approval of the Class A Consent Solicitation, the Obligors will not make any Class A Restricted
Payments with effect from the date on which the waiver in respect of the Class A FCF DSCR covenant becomes effective
up to the earlier of: (i) the date on which a Waiver End Date Certificate is delivered to the Borrower Security Trustee;
and (ii) the Financial Covenant Test Date occurring in February 2022.

In addition, the Borrowers must not make any payment in respect of the Class B Loans or purchase any Class
B Notes if the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is not then satisfied, unless such payment is made using new equity
funds of any Borrower received for this purpose or (following the approval of the Class A Consent Solicitation), on or
prior to the Financial Covenant Test Date occurring in February 2022, if a Waiver End Date Certificate has not been
delivered to the Borrower Security Trustee the proceeds of a Class B Loan (provided that the aggregate amount of the
proceeds of any Class B Loan that is applied to pay interest in respect of the Class B Loans may not exceed £75 million).

Following the approval of the Class A Consent Solicitation, notwithstanding that the Class A Restricted
Payment Condition is not satisfied, on or prior to the Financial Covenant Test Date occurring in February 2022, and so
long as a Waiver End Date Certificate has not been delivered to the Borrower Security Trustee, the Borrowers may use
the proceeds of any Class B Loan to make payments in respect of the Class B Loans or purchase any Class B Notes
(subject to a cap of £75 million for the purposes of payments of interest in respect of the Class B Loans).

For these purposes:

The “Class A Restricted Payment Condition” is the condition which will be satisfied if:

(i) as at the most recent Financial Covenant Test Date, the Class A FCF DSCR calculated as at such
Financial Covenant Test Date is greater than or equal to 135%;

135


-----

(ii) on the payment date of any Class A Restricted Payment, either (i) there is no drawing outstanding
(other than a Standby Drawing (as defined below)) under the Liquidity Facility Agreement; or
(ii) if applicable, the Liquidity Reserve remains fully funded;

(iii) a compliance certificate has been provided in respect of the most recent Financial Covenant Test
Date;

(iv) on the payment date of any Class A Restricted Payment, no event of default or potential event of
default under the Class A Notes is continuing; and

(v) on the payment date of any Class A Restricted Payment, the amount available under the liquidity
facility pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement or (as applicable) the Liquidity Reserve is not
less than the lesser of (i) £90 million; and (ii) 24 months’ peak debt service on the Class A Notes.

A “Waiver End Date Certificate” is a certificate delivered by the Obligor Group Agent to the Borrower
Security Trustee confirming that as of the date of such Waiver End Date Certificate:

(i) no Class A Loan Event of Default or Class A Loan Potential Event of Default is continuing;

(ii) the Class A FCF DSCR calculated in respect of the 13 four-week periods ending on the last day of the
immediately preceding four-week period is greater than or equal to 135 per cent.;

(iii) either:

(A) there is no drawing outstanding (other than a Liquidity Standby Drawing) under the Liquidity
Facility Agreement; or

(B) if applicable, the Liquidity Reserve remains fully funding; and

(iv) the amount available under the Liquidity Facility or (as applicable) the Liquidity Reserve is not less

than the Liquidity Cash Reserve Required Amount.

From and including the date of delivery of the Waiver End Date Certificate up to and including the next
Financial Covenant Test Date, Obligors shall be entitled to make Class A Restricted Payments, provided that
on the payment date of any Class A Restricted Payment, no Class A Loan Event of Default (or potential
Class A Loan Event of Default) is continuing. On and from the Financial Covenant Test Date occurring after
the date of delivery of the Waiver End Date Certificate, the ability of Obligors to make Class A Restricted
Payments shall be subject to satisfaction of the Class A Restricted Payment Condition.

capital expenditure was assessed in February 2020 and remains at £18.5 million per annum; it will
next be assessed in 2028; and

(bb) it will comply with all environmental laws.

Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.

_Accession of Additional Site Entities_

Subject to certain conditions, if an additional site in the United Kingdom is owned by a non-Obligor, such
additional site must accede to the Obligor Group within three years of the later of the acquisition of the relevant
additional site or the date the additional site has become operational and has started to receive paying customers (subject
to certain exceptions). The conditions to an additional site acceding to the Obligor Group include (a) confirmation from

**_Original Class B Notes_**

The Issuer issued £280,000,000 11.625% Class B Fixed Rate Notes due 2042 (the “Original Class B Notes”) on
the Closing Date. On the Closing Date, the Issuer, the Original Borrowers, the Guarantors and the Borrower Security
Trustee, among others, entered into a junior loan agreement (the “Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer made available to the Original Borrowers a
subordinated secured facility in an aggregate principal amount of £280.0 million (the advance thereunder, the “Original
**Class B Loan”). The Original Class B Loan and the Original Class B Notes were refinanced in full (together with accrued**
interest and any Class B make-whole payment due in respect of the Original Class B Notes) by using the proceeds from
the issuance of the Class B2 Notes (described below).

**_Class B2 Notes_**

The Issuer issued the Class B2 Notes on the Third Closing Date.

On the Third Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Class B2 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make
advances to the Third Initial Borrowers pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of £560.0 million. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Class
B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer provided to the Third Initial Borrowers a secured facility (the “Class B2
**Loan”) which was contractually subordinated in terms of payments and security to the Class A Loans (other than the Topco**
Share Security).

The Center Parcs Group refinanced the Class B2 Loan and the Issuer redeemed the Class B2 Notes on the Fourth
Closing Date using the proceeds from the issuance of the Further Class A4 Notes, the Class B3 Notes and the Class B4
Notes.

**_Class B3 Notes and Class B4 Notes_**

On the Fourth Closing Date the Issuer issued the Class B3 Notes and the Class B4 Notes.

The proceeds of the issue of the Class B3 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make advances to the Third Initial
Borrowers pursuant to a secured facility (the “Class B3 Facility”) under the Third Amended and Restated Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of £480.0 million (“the Class B3 Loan”). The proceeds
of the issue of the Class B4 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make advances to the Third Initial Borrowers pursuant to
a secured facility (the “Class B4 Facility”) under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in an aggregate principal
amount of £250.0 million (the “Class B4 Loan”). Each of the Class B Loans is contractually subordinated to the Class A
Facilities pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Third Initial Borrowers must repay the Class B3 Loan in full on the Loan Interest Payment Date in February
2047 (the Class B3 Loan Final Maturity Date) to the extent not repaid, prepaid or otherwise discharged in full prior to
that date. The Third Initial Borrowers must repay the Class B4 Loan in full on the Loan Interest Payment Date in February
2047 (the Class B4 Loan Final Maturity Date) to the extent not repaid, prepaid or otherwise discharged in full prior to
that date.

The Class B3 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full on 28 August 2022 (the “Class B3 Note Expected
**Maturity Date”). The Class B4 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full on 28 August 2025 (the “Class B4 Note**
**Expected Maturity Date”).**

The Class B3 Notes accrue interest at the rate of 4.250% per annum from (and including) the Fourth Closing Date
up to (but excluding) 28 August 2022 and, thereafter, 4.250% per annum and the Class B4 Notes accrue interest at the rate
of 4.875% per annum from (and including) the Fourth Closing Date up to (but excluding) 28 August 2025 and, thereafter,
4.875% per annum.

The Class B3 Loan is expected to be redeemed in full by 24 August 2022 (the “Class B3 Loan Expected Maturity
**Date”) and the Class B4 Loan is expected to be redeemed in full by 25 August 2025 (the “Class B4 Loan Expected**

139


-----

**Maturity Date” and together with the Class B3 Loan Expected Maturity Date, each a “Class B Loan Expected Maturity**
**Date”). If, on the relevant Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date, the relevant Class B Loan remains outstanding, the**
relevant Class B Noteholders can enforce their rights under the Topco Share Security Agreement and the CP Cayman
Security Agreement, each as described in more detail below.

In respect of the Class B3 Notes, from (and including) the Class B3 Note Expected Maturity Date, the Issuer will
not make payments of interest in respect of the Class B3 Notes. Instead, interest will accrue on the Class B3 Notes at the
applicable rate (as set out above) but will be deferred and will be payable only on the earlier of (a) the date on which the
Class A Notes are repaid in full and (b) 28 February 2047. Interest will accrue on such deferred interest at the rate otherwise
payable on unpaid principal of the Class B3 Notes at such time.

In respect of the Class B4 Notes, from (and including) the Class B4 Note Expected Maturity Date, the Issuer will
not make payments of interest in respect of the Class B4 Notes. Instead, interest will accrue on the Class B4 Notes at the
applicable rate (as set out above) but will be deferred and will be payable only on the earlier of (a) the date on which the
Class A Notes are repaid in full and (b) 28 February 2047. Interest will accrue on such deferred interest at the rate otherwise
payable on unpaid principal of the Class B4 Notes at such time.

The economic terms and conditions of the Class B3 Loan and Class B4 Loan (including, among other things, in
relation to the payment of interest and the repayment and prepayment of principal) are broadly similar to the terms and
conditions of the Class B3 Notes and Class B4 Notes.

The Third Initial Borrowers may prepay all or a part of the Class B3 Facility on any one or more occasions at a
specified prepayment price (expressed as a percentages of principal amount depending on the year in which such
prepayment is made), plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, on the Class B3 Facility prepaid, to
the applicable date of prepayment. Upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax law, the Third Initial Borrowers may
prepay all of the Class B3 Facility at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

At any time prior to 28 August 2020, the Third Initial Borrowers may, at their option but subject to certain
conditions, prepay up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Class B4 Facility at a specified prepayment price
(expressed as a percentage of the principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the
date of prepayment with the proceeds of certain equity offerings.

At any time prior to 28 August 2020, the Third Initial Borrowers may, at their option, prepay all or part of the
Class B4 Facility on any one or more occasions at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Class
B4 Facility prepaid, plus the applicable premium and accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the
date of prepayment.

On or after 28 August 2020, the Third Initial Borrowers may prepay all or a part of the Class B4 Facility on any
one or more occasions at a specified prepayment price (expressed as a percentages of principal amount depending on the
year in which such prepayment is made), plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, on the Class B4
Facility prepaid, to the applicable date of prepayment. Upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax law, the Third Initial
Borrowers may prepay all of the Class B4 Facility at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Under the Class B IBLA, the Obligors are required to give certain representations and become subject to certain
covenants in respect of the Class B3 Loan and the Class B4 Loan, which are substantially the same as those in respect of
the Class B5 Loan and described in more detail in the section entitled “Description of the _Class B5 Loan”._

**Share Enforcement Event**

No event of default may occur with respect to the Class B Notes or Class B Loans while the Class A Loans or
Class A Notes are still outstanding (until after an acceleration of the Class A Notes or Class A Loans, respectively).
However, upon the occurrence of any event that would otherwise constitute an event of default (each, a “Share
**Enforcement Event”), the Class B Noteholders have the ability to demand repayment by Topco pursuant to the Topco**
Undertaking and direct the security trustee to enforce the security granted pursuant to the Topco Security Documents. The
events that could lead to such a Share Enforcement Event or, in certain cases, an event of default, are customary for high
yield debt instruments and subject to customary grace periods. See “Description of the Class B5 Loan” for a further
description of the Share Enforcement Events.

If at any time no Class A Loans or Additional Class A Loans remain outstanding, or an acceleration of the Class A
Loan has occurred, any such Share Enforcement Event will also constitute a Class B Loan Event of Default.

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Class B Notes and any non-contractual obligations arising out
of or in connection with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Class B Notes are governed by English law.

**Borrower Security Documents**

The obligations in respect of the Class B3 Loan and the Class B4 Loan benefit from the security described in the section
entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements – Borrower Security Documents”

**Liquidity Facility Agreement**

On the Second Issue Date, the Issuer entered into the Liquidity Facility Agreement with, among others, Barclays Bank
PLC, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, the Liquidity Facility Agent, the Cash Manager and the Issuer Security
Trustee, pursuant to which Barclays Bank PLC and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch agreed to make a liquidity
facility (the “Liquidity Facility”) available to meet certain liquidity shortfalls. On the Fourth Closing Date, Deutsche
Bank AG, London Branch transferred its commitment under the Liquidity Facility to NatWest Markets Plc and the
Liquidity Facility Agreement was amended to be on the terms described below, with certain further amendments, also
reflected below, made on the Fifth Closing Date to reflect an increase in the size and extension of the term of the
Liquidity Facility.

In May 2019, NatWest Markets Plc transferred its commitment under the Liquidity Facility to HSBC UK Bank Plc.
Following various transfers between Barclays Bank PLC and HSBC UK Bank Plc, HSBC UK Bank Plc and Barclays
Bank PLC each have 50 per cent. of the commitments under the Liquidity Facility Agreement. References to “Liquidity
**Facility Providers” below shall be to Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”) and HSBC UK Bank Plc (“HSBC”).**

Under the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Liquidity Facility Providers will provide a 364-day commitment
in an aggregate amount equal to £90 million, with Barclays providing a £45 million commitment and HSBC providing a
£45 million commitment. The Issuer will be permitted to make drawings to service interest due on the Class A Notes,
together with certain senior ranking expenses owed to other transaction parties, in the event of there being insufficient
cash flow received from the Obligors under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

The Liquidity Facility Agreement provides that the amounts drawn by the Issuer (such amounts, a “Liquidity Loan
**Drawing”) and repaid to the Liquidity Facility Providers may be redrawn.**

Each Liquidity Facility Provider must be a bank, the long term unsecured, unsubordinated and unguaranteed long term
obligations of which must be rated, in the case of S&P BBB and, in the case of Fitch, BBB (or, in each case, such other
lower rating which is consistent with the published criteria (relevant for the applicable counterparty) of the relevant
Rating Agency) (the “Requisite Rating”).

The Liquidity Facility Agreement provides that: if (i) at any time the relevant rating of a Liquidity Facility
Provider falls below the Requisite Rating; or (ii) a Liquidity Facility Provider does not agree to renew such Liquidity
Facility prior to the expiry of the 364 day period, the Issuer shall, if it is unable to enter into a substitute liquidity facility
in accordance with the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement, draw the available commitment of such Liquidity
Facility Provider and place the same on deposit (such drawing, a “Standby Drawing” and, together with a Liquidity
Loan Drawing, a “Drawing”) in the relevant Liquidity Standby Account. The Issuer may only withdraw amounts from
such Liquidity Standby Account to enable the Issuer to service interest due on the Class A Notes, together with certain
senior ranking expenses owed to other transaction parties, in the event of there being insufficient cash flow received from
the Obligors under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

In addition, in the event that a Standby Drawing was made following the downgrade of a Liquidity Facility
Provider, the Issuer will use its reasonable endeavours to help such Liquidity Facility Provider to find a suitable
replacement Liquidity Facility Provider or guarantor (as applicable) with the Requisite Rating.

Interest accrues on any Drawing at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin equal to 1.50% per annum (together
with certain mandatory costs). Under the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Issuer is also required to pay
additional amounts if: (i) a withholding or deduction for or on account of tax is imposed on payments required to be
made to any Liquidity Facility Provider; or (ii) any Liquidity Facility Provider suffers an increase in the cost of providing
its Commitment under the Liquidity Facility. From the Year 5 Step-Up Date the rate of interest applicable to any

26.12 **Indemnity required — Obligor level**

The Borrower Security Trustee will not be obliged to deliver a Loan Enforcement Notice, a Loan Acceleration

indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction against all Liabilities to which it may become liable or which it may
incur by giving any Loan Enforcement Notice, Loan Acceleration Notice or taking any Enforcement Action in
respect of the Borrower Security except that the Borrower Security Trustee agrees that, in respect of the
appointment of a Receiver pursuant to paragraph 26.5 (Appointment of Receiver to block an administrator —
_Obligor level) only, notwithstanding any other term of the ICA or any other Borrower Transaction Document, it_
is adequately indemnified and secured to its satisfaction.

**27.** **Enforcement Action if Class B Notes Outstanding**

27.1 **Introduction**

The ICA will provide that the exercise and enforcement of rights by the Instructing Group in respect of the
Borrower Security that has become enforceable is in certain circumstances subject to the provision of a Fairness
Opinion to the Class B Note Trustee (for the benefit of itself and the Class B Noteholders).

27.2 **Requirement for a Fairness Opinion**

If:

(a) there are any Class B Notes outstanding;

(b) the Borrower Security has become enforceable; and

(c) the Class A Instructing Group have instructed the Issuer Security Trustee to require the Borrower
Security Trustee to deliver a Class A Loan Enforcement Notice,

then, subject to paragraph 27.3 (Borrower Security Trustee may dispose under a Sales Process), the
Borrower Security Trustee will (or will procure that any agent, receiver or delegate appointed to act on
behalf of the Borrower Security Trustee pursuant to this Agreement will) comply with the following
conditions:

(i) before any disposal of any Borrower Secured Property of a value more than £10 million the
Borrower Security Trustee will procure the provision to the Class B Note Trustee (for the benefit
of itself and the Class B Noteholders), of a Fairness Opinion (having asked at least three
potential Financial Advisers for a quote in respect of the costs for the provision thereof);

200


-----

(ii) such Fairness Opinion must be delivered to the Class B Note Trustee at least two weeks before
the proposed disposal;

(iii) subject to and in accordance with paragraph 30.3 (Appointment of Receiver to block an
_administrator — Issuer level), the Borrower Security Trustee will be responsible for_
commissioning any Fairness Opinion;

(iv) neither the Class B Note Trustee nor any Class B Noteholder will be entitled to raise any
objections to any Fairness Opinion delivered by the Borrower Security Trustee in accordance
with paragraph (ii); and

(v) the cost of commissioning any Fairness Opinion will be for the account of the Borrower Security
Trustee provided always that the Borrower Security Trustee is prefunded to an amount equal to
the cost of such Fairness Opinion as an expense of the enforcement process except that if the
cost is more than £500,000 (excluding VAT), then:

(A) the excess cost will be for the account of the Class B Noteholders, provided that:

(I) where one of the potential Financial Advisers offered to produce a Fairness
Opinion for less than £500,000 (excluding VAT) but the Class A Noteholders
directed the Borrower Security Trustee to select another provider whose fees
for providing the opinion are in excess of £500,000, all such fees will be for
the account of the enforcement process generally (and not specifically for the
account of the Class B Noteholders); and

(II) if more than one potential Financial Adviser provides a quote and all the
quotes provided are in excess of £500,000, the Class B Noteholders will be
required to pay for all fees in excess of £500,000 save where the Class A
Noteholders select a Financial Adviser which has provided a quote which is
higher than another quote provided; and

(B) the Borrower Security Trustee will not be obliged to commission any Fairness Opinion
unless:

(I) it is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction and/or prefunded; and/or

(II) receives an undertaking from the Class B Noteholders that the Class B
Noteholders will indemnify, secure and/or pre-fund the Borrower Security
Trustee for any excess costs in relation to commissioning any Fairness
Opinion, if applicable.

27.3 **Borrower Security Trustee may dispose under a Sales Process**

If the Borrower Security Trustee:

(a) is unable to appoint a Financial Adviser when requested or unable to obtain a Fairness Opinion; or

(b) is notified in writing by the Class B Note Trustee on behalf of the Class B Noteholders that the Class B
Noteholders do not require the procurement of a Fairness Opinion; or

(c) intends to dispose of the assets for a value that is less than the proposed consideration specified in respect
of such assets in a Fairness Opinion, then:

(i) subject to applicable law, the Borrower Security Trustee or any Receiver will only dispose of
relevant assets through a competitive marketing and sales process typical for such type of assets
with a view to obtaining a fair market consideration for such assets under the then prevailing
market conditions (“Sales Process”) and will be entitled to appoint any investment bank,
accounting firm or any other third party professional organisation of international standing
engaged in the marketing and sale of businesses and assets, to advise the Borrower Security
Trustee or the Receiver in relation to such disposal; and

(ii) the Borrower Security Trustee or any Receiver will be entitled to dispose of the assets under
and in accordance with the Sales Process (including, at a value less than that stated in any
Fairness Opinion), provided that if there is more than one party willing to acquire the assets,

201


-----

then the Borrower Security Trustee or the Receiver will be required to accept the highest
executable offer.

27.4 **Fairness Opinion only required if Class A Notes are outstanding**

Except as set out in paragraph 27.2 (Requirement for a Fairness Opinion), in no other circumstances will a
Fairness Opinion be required prior to the disposal of any Borrower Secured Property.

27.5 **Class A Instructing Group may provide Directions to appoint Financial Adviser**

The Class A Instructing Group may provide any Direction to Issuer Security Trustee to require the Borrower
Security Trustee to appoint any Financial Adviser and the Borrower Security Trustee will act in accordance with
any such Direction.

(a) Further to paragraph 27.5 (Class A Instructing Group may provide Directions to appoint Financial
_Adviser), the Borrower Security Trustee will be entitled to seek any Direction from the Issuer Security_
Trustee in relation to any matter concerning the commissioning of a Fairness Opinion or otherwise, the
enforcement of the Borrower Security and the Borrower Security Trustee will be required to follow any
Direction given by the Issuer Security Trustee.

(b) The Issuer Security Trustee will be entitled to seek any Direction from the Class A Instructing Group in
relation to any request for any Direction made by the Borrower Security Trustee pursuant to paragraph
(a) above, concerning the commissioning of a Fairness Opinion or otherwise the enforcement of the
Borrower Security and the Issuer Security Trustee will be required to follow any Direction given to it by
the Class A Instructing Group.

**28.** **Loan Acceleration Notice**

28.1 **Loan Acceleration Notice**

Borrower Security Trustee is instructed to do so by the Issuer Security Trustee, and the Issuer Security Trustee
shall give such instruction to the Borrower Security Trustee if the Issuer Security Trustee is directed to do so by
the relevant Instructing Group, pursuant to paragraph 26.3 (Loan Enforcement Instruction Notices) (and as further
specified in paragraphs 26.4(c) and 26.4(d) (Instructions prior to the Class A Discharge Date)) and the indemnity
requirements set out in paragraph 26.12 (Indemnity required — Obligor level) have been satisfied, and unless and
until so instructed and indemnified, the Borrower Security Trustee will be under no obligation to and will not
deliver a Loan Acceleration Notice.

28.2 **Consequences of delivery of Loan Acceleration Notice**

(a) Upon the delivery of a Loan Acceleration Notice, all outstanding amounts under the Class A IBLA and/or
Class B IBLA as applicable will be declared immediately due and payable.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of the ICA or any other Transaction Document, if a Loan
Acceleration Notice has been served by the Borrower Security Trustee (but not otherwise), the other
Borrower Secured Creditors may serve a notice or notices declaring any amount payable to a Borrower
Secured Creditor under a Borrower Transaction Document to be payable in advance of its stated maturity
or requiring the payment of any termination amount under a relevant Borrower Transaction Document.

(c) The Borrower Security Trustee will deliver a copy of the Loan Acceleration Notice to:

(i) the Issuer Security Trustee;

(ii) the Rating Agencies;

The ICA will provide that notwithstanding that neither Security Trustee nor any other Secured Creditors may have
any right of recourse against the Rating Agencies in respect of any Rating Agency Confirmation or any Rating
Assessment given by any of them and relied upon by such Security Trustee, each Security Trustee will be entitled,
for the purposes of exercising any right, power, trust, authority, duty or discretion under or in relation to the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party or over which it has security:

(a) to have regard to any Rating Agency Confirmation or any Ratings Assessment if the Transaction
Documents require, or in any particular circumstance, where such Security Trustee considers, that a
Rating Agency Confirmation or a Ratings Assessment is an appropriate test or the only appropriate test

case may be, in giving the relevant consent; and

will not be monitored by Fitch and therefore will not be updated to reflect changed circumstances or
information that may affect the Ratings Assessment; and does not address other matters falling outside
of the Relevant Disposal (as defined in the Class A IBLA) that may be of relevance to the Noteholders;

(b) neither of the Security Trustees will have any right of recourse to or against Fitch in respect of a Ratings
Assessment which is relied upon by either Security Trustee; and

any actual or contingent liability to any person (including, without limitation, the Security Trustees) or

Loan Expected Maturity Date of such Class B Loan and (ii) the date on which Topco receives a valid notice of demand
from the Borrower Security Trustee following the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event or Class B Loan Event of

the Borrower Security Trustee by Topco over the shares Topco holds in CP Cayman Limited and the share security

registered in the name of a nominee for, the Common Depositary for Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear on the Sixth
Closing Date. Upon deposit of the Class B Global Notes, the Clearing Systems credited each subscriber of Class B Notes
with the principal amount of Notes of the relevant class equal to the aggregate principal amount thereof for which it had
subscribed and paid.

1.2 For so long as the Class B Notes are represented by a Class B Global Note and the Clearing Systems so permit,
the Class B Notes will be tradeable only in the minimum authorised denomination of £100,000 and higher integral multiples
of £1,000.

1.3 The Class B Registrar shall maintain a register in respect of the Class B Notes (the Class B Register) outside the
United Kingdom which shall be the sole register in respect of the Class B Notes in accordance with the provisions of the
Agency Agreement and shall record in the Class B Register the names and addresses of the Holders of the Class B Notes,
particulars of the Class B Notes and all transfers and redemptions thereof.

1.4 Title to the Class B Notes will pass by and upon registration in the Class B Register. The Holder of each Class B
Note shall (except as otherwise required by a court of competent jurisdiction or applicable law) be treated as the absolute
owner of such Class B Note for all purposes.

1.5 Interests in a Class B Global Note will be transferable in accordance with the rules and procedures for the time
being of the relevant Clearing Systems and the regulations concerning the transfer of Class B Notes set out in the Agency
Agreement.

1.6 If, while any of the Class B Notes are represented by a Class B Global Note (a) the Issuer has been notified that
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg have been closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than
by reason of holiday, whether statutory or otherwise) or have announced an intention permanently to cease business or
have in fact done so and, in any such case, no successor clearing system satisfactory to the Class B Note Trustee is available
or (b) by reason of a change in Tax law (or the application or official interpretation thereof), which change becomes
effective on or after the Fourth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B3 Notes and the Class B4 Notes) or the Sixth Closing
Date (in respect of the Class B5 Notes), the Issuer has or will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would
not be suffered were the Class B Notes in definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed by two directors of the
Issuer has been given to the Class B Note Trustee, then the Issuer will issue Class B Notes of the relevant class in definitive
form (Class B Definitive Notes) in exchange for such Class B Global Note (free of charge to the persons entitled to them)
within 30 days of the occurrence of the relevant event. These Class B Conditions and the Transaction Documents will be
amended in such manner as the Class B Note Trustee and the Issuer Security Trustee may require to take account of the
issue of Class B Definitive Notes.

1.7 Class B Definitive Notes, if issued, will only be printed and issued in denominations of £100,000 and integral
multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. Such Class B Notes will be serially numbered and will be issued in registered form.

1.8 The Issuer may, from time to time, create and issue Class B Further Notes (in accordance with Condition 19.1
(Class B Further Notes and Class B New Notes)) having the same terms and conditions as the Class B Notes or any subclass thereof in all respects (or in all respects except for the first payment of interest). Such Class B Further Notes shall be
consolidated with the Class B Notes or sub-class thereof and form one series with all prior issues of the relevant sub-class
of Class B Notes. In addition, the Issuer may, from time to time, create and issue Class B New Notes (in accordance with
Condition 19.1 (Class B Further Notes and Class B New Notes)) having terms that differ from the Class B3 Notes, the
Class B4 Notes and the Class B5 Notes and do not form a single series with any of them.

1.9 Accordingly the Class B Notes or any sub-class thereof may comprise a number of issues in addition to the initial
issue of such Class B Notes.

**2.** **STATUS,** **PRIORITY AND SECURITY**

**Status and relationship between the Class B Notes**

2.1 (a) The Class B Notes constitute direct, secured, limited recourse and unconditional obligations of the Issuer and are

secured by the same security over the assets of the Issuer. The Class B Notes rank pari passu without preference
or priority amongst themselves but are subordinated to the Class A Notes only as to payment provisions and as to
the ranking of their interest in the security provided of, and pursuant to, the Issuer Deed of Charge, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Note Trust Deed.

(b) The Note Trust Deed contains provisions requiring the Class B Note Trustee to have regard to the interests of the
Class B Noteholders equally as regards all rights, powers, trusts, authorities, duties and discretions of the Class B
Note Trustee (except where expressly provided otherwise). If there is more than one sub-class of Class B Notes
outstanding, the Class B Note Trustee shall have regard to the interests of the Class B Noteholders as a class,
subject to Class B Condition 14 (Amendment, Supplement and Waiver).

(c) In the event of an issue of Class B Further Notes or Class B New Notes, the provisions of the Note Trust Deed,
these Class B Conditions, the Issuer Deed of Charge and the other Transaction Documents, including (in the case
of Class B New Notes) those concerning:

(i) the basis on which the Class B Note Trustee and/or the Issuer Security Trustee (as applicable) will be
required to exercise or perform their respective rights, powers, trusts, authorities, duties and discretions
(including in circumstances where, in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee, there is a conflict between
the interests of any class of the Class B Noteholders and the holders of such Class B Further Notes or
Class B New Notes or of the other Issuer Secured Creditors);

(ii) the circumstances in which the Class B Note Trustee and/or the Issuer Security Trustee (as applicable)
will become bound to take action, as referred to in Condition 9 (Class B Note Events of Default) and
Condition 11 (Enforcement);

(iii) the passing of effective Class B Extraordinary Resolutions by Class B Noteholders (or a sub-class
thereof); and

(iv) the order of the Issuer Pre-Acceleration Priority of Payments or of the Issuer Post-Acceleration Priority
of Payments,

will be modified in such manner as the Class B Note Trustee or, as the case may be, the Issuer Security Trustee
considers necessary to reflect the issue of such Class B Further Notes or Class B New Notes and any new
Transaction Documents entered into in connection with such Class B Further Notes or Class B New Notes and
the ranking thereof and of the claims of any party to any of such new Transaction Documents in relation to each
class of the Class B Notes.

(d) If any Class B Further Notes or Class B New Notes are issued, the Issuer will immediately advise the Central
Bank and the Irish Stock Exchange or The International Stock Exchange (as the case may be) accordingly and
procure the publication of a notice of the issue in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders).

(e) The Class B Note Trustee and the Issuer Security Trustee shall be entitled to assume, for the purpose of exercising
any right, power, trust, authority, duty or discretion under or in relation to these Class B Conditions or any of the
Transaction Documents, that such exercise will not be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class B
Noteholders (or any class thereof) if the Rating Agencies have provided a Rating Agency Confirmation with
respect thereto.

(f) The Class B Notes are solely the obligation of the Issuer and are not the obligation of, nor guaranteed by, any of
the Class B Note Trustee, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Issuer Account Bank, the Cash Manager, the Class B
Registrar, the Class B Transfer Agent or the Principal Paying Agent.

(g) Prior to the delivery of a Class B Note Acceleration Notice pursuant to Condition 9 (Class B Note Events of
_Default), the Issuer shall be required to apply all amounts standing to the credit of the Issuer Transaction Account_

**Enforceable Security**

2.3 (a) The Class B Note Trustee shall, in the event of the Issuer Security becoming enforceable as provided in and

subject to the Issuer Deed of Charge and the Intercreditor Agreement (if directed by the Class B Noteholders),

Undertaking, and (ii) if such demand is not met in full, to enforce the Topco Security (including, but not limited

**4.** **CLASS B** **INTEREST**

**Period of accrual**

4.1 Each Class B Note (or, in the case of the redemption of only part of a Class B Note, that part only of such Class
B Note) will cease to bear interest from (and including) the due date for redemption unless, upon due presentation in
accordance with Condition 6 (Payments), payment of the principal in respect of the Class B Note is improperly withheld
or refused or default is otherwise made in respect of the payment, in which event interest shall continue to accrue as
provided in the Note Trust Deed.

**Class B Interest Rate and Note Interest Payment Dates**

4.2 (a) The Class B3 Notes bear interest on their respective Principal Amount Outstanding (i) from (and including) the

Fourth Closing Date until (but excluding) the Class B3 Note Step-Down Date at 4.250% per annum and (ii) from

238


-----

4.250% per annum (in each case, the applicable Class B3 Interest Rate). The Class B4 Notes bear interest on their
respective Principal Amount Outstanding (i) from (and including) the Fourth Closing Date until (but excluding)
the Class B4 Note Step-Down Date at 4.875% per annum and (ii) from (and including) the Class B4 Note StepDown Date to (and including) the Class B4 Note Final Maturity Date, at 4.875% per annum (in each case, the

together with the Class B3 Interest Rate and the B4 Interest Rate, the Class B Interest Rate.

(b) With respect to the Class B3 Notes and the Class B4 Notes, the period from and including the Fourth Closing

the Class B3 Notes on the corresponding Note Interest Payment Date. If on any Note Interest Payment Date, the
amount received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B3 Loan is not sufficient to pay the
interest accrued on the Class B3 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period in full, the amount
of interest accrued up to any such Note Interest Payment Date that is not paid by the Issuer on such Note Interest
Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest being a **_Class B3_** **_Deferred Interest_**
**_Amount) and such Class B3 Deferred Interest Amount shall continue to accrue interest at the then applicable Class_**
B3 Note Interest Rate until it is paid by the Issuer in full.

B3 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period; and

(ii) on such Note Interest Payment Date, a Class B3 Deferred Interest Amount in respect of any prior Note

and payable by the Issuer in pounds sterling on the Class B3 Note Final Maturity Date.

(e) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the Issuer receives a payment of interest (whether in whole or in part) on
the Class B4 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, then the
Issuer will be obliged to make a corresponding payment of interest (in whole or in part, as the case may be) on

amount received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B4 Loan is not sufficient to pay the
interest accrued on the Class B4 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period in full, the amount
of interest accrued up to any such Note Interest Payment Date that is not paid by the Issuer on such Note Interest
Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest being a **_Class B4_** **_Deferred Interest_**
**_Amount) and such Class B4 Deferred Interest Amount shall continue to accrue interest at the then applicable Class_**
B4 Note Interest Rate until it is paid by the Issuer in full.

(f) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date:

(i) the Issuer receives a payment of interest on the Class B4 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance with
the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in excess of the amount of interest accrued on the Class
B4 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period; and

(ii) on such Note Interest Payment Date, a Class B4 Deferred Interest Amount in respect of any prior Note
Interest Period remains outstanding,

then the Issuer shall apply such excess to reduce the then outstanding Class B4 Deferred Interest Amount. Any
accrued but unpaid interest and the aggregate amount of all Class B4 Deferred Interest Amounts then unpaid on
the Class B4 Notes and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts (if any) shall be due
and payable by the Issuer in pounds sterling on the Class B4 Note Final Maturity Date.

(g) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the Issuer receives a payment of interest (whether in whole or in part) on
the Class B5 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, then the
Issuer will be obliged to make a corresponding payment of interest (in whole or in part, as the case may be) on
the Class B5 Notes on the corresponding Note Interest Payment Date. If on any Note Interest Payment Date, the
amount received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B5 Loan is not sufficient to pay the
interest accrued on the Class B5 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period in full, the amount
of interest accrued up to any such Note Interest Payment Date that is not paid by the Issuer on such Note Interest
Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest being a **_Class B5_** **_Deferred Interest_**
**_Amount) and such Class B5 Deferred Interest Amount shall continue to accrue interest at the then applicable Class_**
B5 Note Interest Rate until it is paid by the Issuer in full.

(h) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date:

(i) the Issuer receives a payment of interest on the Class B5 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance with
the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in excess of the amount of interest accrued on the Class
B5 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period; and

(ii) on such Note Interest Payment Date, a Class B5 Deferred Interest Amount in respect of any prior Note
Interest Period remains outstanding,

then the Issuer shall apply such excess to reduce the then outstanding Class B5 Deferred Interest Amount. Any
accrued but unpaid interest and the aggregate amount of all Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts then unpaid on
the Class B5 Notes and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts (if any) shall be due
and payable by the Issuer in pounds sterling on the Class B5 Note Final Maturity Date.

**Calculation of Class B Interest**

4.3 Interest in respect of the Class B Notes and interest payable in respect of any overdue amount of principal or Class
B3 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B4 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts (as
applicable) shall be calculated by applying the applicable Class B Interest Rate to the aggregate Principal Amount
Outstanding of each sub-class of the Class B Notes or the aggregate amount of any overdue amount of principal or Class
B3 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B4 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts (as
applicable) in respect of the Class B3 Notes, the Class B4 Notes and the Class B5 Notes, as the case may be, and on the
basis of (a) the actual number of days in the period from (and including) the date from which interest begins to accrue
(being the Fourth Closing Date (in respect of the first such period for the Class B3 Notes and the Class B4 Notes), the Sixth
Closing Date (in respect of the first such period for the Class B5 Notes) or a Note Interest Payment Date (in respect of
subsequent such period)) (the Class B Accrual Date) to (but excluding) the date on which it falls due divided by (b) the
actual number of days from (and including) the Class B Accrual Date to (but excluding) the next following Note Interest
Payment Date multiplied by two; provided that in respect of accrued interest to the first Note Interest Payment Date, interest
shall be calculated on the basis of (a) in respect of the Class B3 Notes and the Class B4 Notes: (x) the actual number of
days from (and including) the Fourth Closing Date to (but excluding) 28 August 2017 divided by (y) the actual number of
days from (and including) 28 February 2017 to (but excluding) 28 August 2017 multiplied by two; and (b) in respect of the
Class B5 Notes: (x) the actual number of days from (and including) the Sixth Closing Date to (but excluding) 28 February
2021 divided by (y) the actual number of days from (and including) 28 February 2020 to (but excluding) 28 February 2021
multiplied by two. The resulting figure shall be rounded down to the nearest penny.

pursuant to Condition 9 (Class B Note Events of Default) including, for the avoidance of doubt, where such nonpayment occurs as a result of the Issuer not receiving any payment due under a Class B Loan on the relevant Class
B Loan Expected Maturity Date. If the Issuer receives (or is to receive) any monies from the Borrowers under
the Topco Payment Undertaking or the proceeds realised from any enforcement of the Topco Security Documents,
the Issuer shall upon giving not more than 10 nor less than 5 Business Days’ notice (which notice may, at the
Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent) to the Class B Noteholders
in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders), apply such monies to redeem on a pro rata
basis the Class B Notes at their respective Principal Amount Outstanding together with accrued but unpaid interest,
Class B3 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B4 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B5 Deferred Interest
Amounts (as applicable) and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any. In the event
that there are insufficient amounts to redeem all of the Class B Notes then outstanding, the Class B Notes shall be
redeemed on a pro rata basis in part in the proportion with which the repayment amount bears to the aggregate
Principal Amount Outstanding of all the Class B Notes then outstanding.

(c) If the proceeds realised following a Class B Trigger Event are insufficient to satisfy all amounts scheduled to be
paid under paragraph (a) above, the Issuer will be obliged to apply any further amounts, if any, it receives as a

-----

result of and pursuant to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement to repay any outstanding amounts on the
Class B Notes on a pro rata basis.

(d) In addition, promptly upon receipt by the Issuer of a notice of prepayment from a Borrower under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement of its intention to make prepayment in whole or in part of any Class B Loan in
accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer shall give not more than 60 nor less
than 10 days’ notice to the relevant Class B Noteholders, the Class B Note Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent
that it will apply the principal funds received from the prepayment of the Class B Loan to redeem a corresponding
Principal Amount Outstanding of the relevant Class B Notes together with accrued but unpaid interest, Class B3
Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B4 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts
(as applicable) in respect of the relevant sub-classes of Class B Notes and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon
and Additional Amounts, if any, on the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of such Class B Notes at the
applicable redemption prices set out in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (and (i) in respect of the
Class B3 Notes and the Class B4 Notes, as described in “Description of the Class B Loan — Prepayment —
_Optional Prepayment” in the 2017 Class B Offering Circular and; (ii) in respect of the Class B5 Notes, as_
described in “Description of the Class B Loan — Prepayment — Optional Prepayment” in the 2020 Class B
Offering Memorandum). Any redemption or notice under this Condition 5.2(d) will be subject to satisfaction of
any conditions precedent set forth in the notice of prepayment from the Borrowers under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
other conditions precedent.

(e) In the case of a partial redemption of a sub-class of Class B Notes, the Class B Notes of the relevant sub-class to
be redeemed (the Class B Redeemed Notes) will be selected individually by lot, in the case of Class B Redeemed
Notes represented by Class B Definitive Notes, and in accordance with the rules of Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg (to be reflected in the records of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg as either a pool factor or
a reduction in nominal amount, at their discretion) in the case of Class B Redeemed Notes represented by a Class
B Global Note, not more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (such date of selection, the Selection
**_Date). In the case of Class B Redeemed Notes represented by Class B Definitive Notes, a list of the serial numbers_**
of such Class B Redeemed Notes will be published in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B
_Noteholders) not less than 15 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. No exchange of the relevant Class B_
Global Note will be permitted during the period from (and including) the Selection Date to (and including) the
date fixed for redemption pursuant to this Condition 5.2(e) and notice to that effect shall be given by the Issuer to
the Class B Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders) at least five days prior
to the Selection Date.

(f) In respect of the Class B5 Notes, in connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer
(as such terms are defined in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) (each a Class B5 Tender Offer) if
not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B5 Notes are validly tendered (and
not validly withdrawn) and purchased by a Borrower pursuant to such Class B5 Tender Offer, if the Issuer receives
a notice of prepayment from the Borrowers under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement of their intention
to prepay the remaining Class B5 Loan, the Issuer shall give not more than 60 nor less than 10 days’ notice to the
relevant Class B Noteholders, the Class B Note Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent that it will apply the
principal funds received from the prepayment of the Class B5 Loan to redeem a corresponding Principal Amount
Outstanding of the Class B5 Notes together with accrued but unpaid interest, Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts
and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts if any, on the aggregate Principal Amount
of such Class B5 Notes to (but excluding) the date of redemption at a price equal to the purchase price offered to
holders of the Class B5 Notes pursuant to the Class B5 Tender Offer. In determining whether at least 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B5 Notes have been validly tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) pursuant to any Class B5 Tender Offer, any Class B5 Notes owned by an Affiliate of a Borrower or
by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of a Borrower, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be
outstanding for the purposes of such Class B5 Tender Offer.

**Optional Redemption for taxation or other reasons**

5.3 (a) If the Issuer at any time certifies to the Class B Note Trustee immediately prior to endeavouring to take the

reasonable measures available to it referred to below that:

(i) by reason of a change in tax laws or regulations (or the application or official interpretation thereof),
which change becomes effective on or after the Fourth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B3 Notes
and the Class B4 Notes) or the Sixth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B5 Notes), on the next Note
Interest Payment Date, the Issuer would be required to deduct or withhold from any payment of principal,

242


-----

interest or other amounts due and payable under the relevant Class B Notes, any amount for or on account
of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed,
levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the United Kingdom or Jersey or any political sub-division
thereof or any authority thereof or therein; or

(ii) by reason of a change in tax laws or regulations (or the application or official interpretation thereof),
which change becomes effective on or after the Fourth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B3 Notes
and the Class B4 Notes) or the Sixth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B5 Notes), on the next Note
Interest Payment Date, the Borrowers under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement would be
required to deduct or withhold from any payment of principal, interest or other sum due and payable
thereunder any amount for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the United
Kingdom or any political sub-division thereof or any authority of either thereof or therein; or

(iii) by reason of a change in tax laws or regulations, which change becomes effective on or after the Fourth
Closing Date (in respect of the Class B3 Notes and the Class B4 Notes) or the Sixth Closing Date (in
respect of the Class B5 Notes), it ceases to be a “securitisation company” (as defined in the Taxation of
Securitisation Companies Regulations 2006) or otherwise entitled to relief on any present or future taxes,
duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or
assessed by the United Kingdom or any political sub-division thereof or any authority thereof or therein

in a material rise in the tax liabilities of the Issuer; or

(iv) on or after the Fourth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B3 Notes and the Class B4 Notes) or the Sixth
Closing Date (in respect of the Class B5 Notes), it has become or will become unlawful for the Issuer to
make, fund or allow to remain outstanding all or any advances made or to be made by it under the Class
B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,

then the Issuer shall, in consultation with the Borrowers and the Class B Note Trustee, take reasonable measures
to avoid the effect of the relevant event described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, (including, without limitation,
appointing a Paying Agent in another jurisdiction and/or using its reasonable endeavours to arrange the
substitution of a company incorporated and/or tax resident in another jurisdiction (approved in writing by the
Class B Note Trustee) as principal debtor under the relevant Class B Notes and as lender under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement; provided that the Class B Note Trustee is satisfied that taking such measures
will not be materially prejudicial to the interests of the relevant Class B Noteholders.

(b) If the Issuer satisfies the Class B Note Trustee immediately before giving the notice referred to below, that one or
more of the events described in (a) above is continuing and that the effect of the relevant event cannot be avoided
by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it, then the Issuer may, on any Note Interest Payment Date
and having given not more than 60 nor less than 10 days’ notice (or, in the case of an event described in (a) above,
such shorter period expiring on or before the latest date permitted by relevant law) to the Class B Note Trustee
and the Class B Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders) (notice being
irrevocable), redeem all, but not some, of the affected Class B Notes at their respective Principal Amount
Outstanding together with accrued but unpaid interest, Class B3 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B4
Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts (as applicable) and any accrued but unpaid
interest thereon, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, up to but excluding the date of redemption. Prior to giving
any notice of redemption pursuant to this Condition 5.3 (Optional Redemption for taxation or other reasons), the
Issuer shall deliver to the Class B Note Trustee (A) a certificate signed by two directors of the Issuer stating that
(x) one or more of the events described in Clause (a) above is continuing and that the effect of the relevant event
cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it, and (y) the Issuer will have the
necessary funds to pay all principal and interest due, if any, in respect of the relevant Class B Notes on the relevant
Note Interest Payment Date and to discharge all other amounts required to be paid by it on the relevant Note
Interest Payment Date in priority to, or pari passu with, the Class B Notes under the Issuer Priorities of Payments;

Note Trustee) of independent legal advisors of recognised standing opining on the relevant event described in
(a)(i), (a)(ii), (a)(iii), and/or (a)(iv). The Class B Note Trustee shall be entitled to accept such certificate (without
enquiry or liability) and (if applicable) such opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set out in (x) and (y) above, and it shall be conclusive and binding on the Class B Noteholders.

**Early redemption following a Class B Loan Enforcement Event**

5.4 If the Issuer receives (or is to receive) any monies from any Obligor following the service of a Class B Loan
Enforcement Notice in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement in repayment of all or any part of the Class B Loans,
the Issuer shall, upon giving not more than 10 nor less than 5 Business Days’ notice to the Class B Note Trustee, the Issuer
Secured Creditors and the Class B Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders), apply
such monies in accordance with the Issuer Pre-Acceleration Priority of Payments or the Issuer Post-Acceleration Priority

B5 Deferred Interest Amounts (as applicable) in respect of such Class B Note and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon
and Additional Amounts, if any, on the relevant date for payment. In the event there are insufficient monies to redeem all
the Class B Notes of a particular sub-class, each relevant sub-class of the Class B Notes shall be redeemed in part in the
proportion with which the repayment amount bears to the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of such sub-class of
the Class B Notes then outstanding.

**Principal Amount Outstanding**

5.5 (a) The Principal Amount Outstanding of a Class B Note on any date shall be its original principal amount less the

amount of all principal payments (excluding premium payable in accordance with Condition 5.2 (Redemption)),
in respect of such Class B Note which have been paid since the Fourth Closing Date (in the case of the Class B3
Notes and the Class B4 Notes) or the Sixth Closing Date (in the case of the Class B5 Notes), except if and to the
extent that any such payment has been improperly withheld or refused.

(b) Each determination by or on behalf of the Issuer of the amount of any Class B Note principal payment and the
aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of a Class B Note shall in each case (in the absence of wilful default,
bad faith or demonstrable or manifest error) be final and binding on all persons. As soon as practicable following
a determination of a Class B Note principal payment and/or the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of a
Class B Note, the Issuer will cause such determination of a Class B Note principal payment and/or the aggregate
Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class B Note to be notified to the Class B Note Trustee, the Class B
Registrar and the Principal Paying Agent and will cause notice of each such determination to be given to Class B
Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders).

**Notice of Redemption**

5.6 Any such notice as is referred to in Condition 5.3 (Optional Redemption for taxation or other reasons) and
Condition 5.4 (Early redemption following a Class B Loan Enforcement Event) shall be irrevocable and, upon the expiration
of such notice, the Issuer shall be bound to redeem the relevant Class B Notes at the applicable amounts specified in these
Class B Conditions.

**No purchase by the Issuer**

_Class B4 Loan — Certain Covenants — Class B Restricted Payments” in the 2017 Class B Offering Circular; and_
(ii) in respect of the Class B5 Notes, as described in “Description of the Class B5 Loan — Certain Covenants —
_Class B Restricted Payments” in the 2020 Class B Offering Memorandum)._

(b) If an Obligor purchases any Class B Notes then it must immediately transfer such Class B Notes to the Issuer in
satisfaction, prepayment and discharge of an amount of such Obligor’s liability under the relevant Class B Loan
equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B Notes transferred by that Obligor together with accrued
but unpaid interest, Deferred Interest Amounts in respect of the relevant Class B Notes and any accrued but unpaid
interest thereon, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, up to but excluding the date of transfer.

**Cancellation**

5.8 Any Class B Notes redeemed by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 5.6 (Notice of Redemption) or Condition
16 (Replacement of Class B Notes), or transferred to the Issuer pursuant to Condition 5.7 (No purchase by the Issuer) will

holder of such Class B Global Note in respect of each amount paid.

**Payment only on a Class B Payment Business Date**

6.5 Where payment is to be made by transfer to an account, payment instructions (for value the date scheduled for
payment, or, if the date scheduled for payment is not a Class B Payment Business Day, for value the next succeeding Class
B Payment Business Day) will be initiated (i) (in the case of payments of principal and interest payable on redemption) on
the later of the due date for payment and the day on which the relevant Class B Note is surrendered (or, in the case of part
payment only, endorsed) at the specified office of a Class B Paying Agent and (ii) (in the case of payments of interest to
be paid other than on redemption) on the date scheduled for payment. A Holder of a Class B Note shall not be entitled to

6.6 The names of the Principal Paying Agent and the Class B Registrar and their respective initial specified offices
are set out at the end of these Class B Conditions. The Issuer reserves the right, subject to the prior written approval of the
Class B Note Trustee, at any time to vary or terminate the appointment of any Paying Agent or the Class B Registrar and
to appoint additional or other Paying Agents or Class B Registrars (including in circumstances where the Principal Paying
Agent, any Paying Agent or the Class B Registrar does not become, or ceases to be, a Participating FFI or otherwise exempt
from withholding or deduction of any Taxes (as that term is defined in Condition 7 (Taxation) below) in respect of FATCA

245


-----

at a time when the Issuer would be required to withhold or deduct any amount from any payment made by it to the Principal
Paying Agent, any Paying Agent or the Class B Registrar pursuant to FATCA) provided that:

(a) there will at all times be a person appointed to perform the obligations of the Principal Paying Agent and the Class
B Registrar;

(b) so long as the Class B Notes are listed on an exchange, there will at all times be at least one Paying Agent (which
may be the Principal Paying Agent) having its specified office in such place as may be required by the rules and
regulations of each relevant stock exchange and competent authority; and

(c) the Issuer will use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that at any time the Issuer would otherwise be required to
withhold tax on payments to the Principal Paying Agent or any other Paying Agent pursuant to FATCA, the
Principal Paying Agent and any other Paying Agents are Participating FFIs or are otherwise exempt from
withholding or deduction of any Taxes (as that term is defined in Condition 7 (Taxation) below) in respect of
FATCA.

6.7 Notice of any termination, variation or appointment and of any changes in specified offices will be given to the
Class B Noteholders promptly by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders).

**7.** **TAXATION**

All payments in respect of the Class B Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer shall be made without withholding or deduction
for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature (Taxes),
unless the withholding or deduction of the Taxes is required by applicable law. In such event, the Issuer shall account to
the relevant authorities for the amount required to be withheld or deducted. In such event, the Issuer will pay such additional
amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the Class B Noteholders after the withholding or
deduction shall equal the respective amounts which would have been receivable in respect of the Class B Notes in the
absence of the withholding or deduction; provided that no such additional amounts will be paid on account of:

(a) any Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any actual or deemed (pursuant to applicable
Tax law of the relevant Tax jurisdiction) present or former connection between the Class B Noteholder (including,
if applicable, a connection between partners (in the case of a partnership) or shareholders (in the case of a
corporation)) and the relevant Tax jurisdiction (including being a resident of such jurisdiction for Tax purposes),
other than holding of such Class B Note, the enforcement of rights under such Class B Note or the receipt of any
payments in respect of such Class B Note;

(b) any Taxes imposed as a result of the presentation of a Class B Note for payment more than 30 days after the
relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Class B Noteholder (except to the extent that the holder
would have been entitled to additional amounts had the Class B Note been presented on the last day of such 30
day period);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, personal property, transfer or similar Taxes;

(d) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to, the Class B
Notes;

(e) any Taxes imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Class B Noteholder, to comply with any reasonable
written request of the Issuer or the Class B Paying Agent addressed to the Class B Noteholders and made at least
30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable to satisfy any certification, identification,
information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative
practice of a relevant Tax jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction
or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the relevant Tax jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification
that the Class B Noteholder is not resident in the relevant Tax jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the
Class B Noteholder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(f) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment to the Class B Noteholder if such Class B Noteholder is a
fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes
would not have been imposed on such payment had such Class B Noteholder been the sole beneficial owner of
such Class B Notes;

(g) any Taxes payable under FATCA; or

246


-----

(h) any combination of items (a) through (g) above.

having been received, notice to that effect is duly given to the relevant Class B Noteholders in accordance with Condition
17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders).

**9.** **CLASS B** **NOTE EVENTS OF DEFAULT**

9.1 Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Class B Note Trustee at its absolute discretion may, and if so directed
in writing by the holders of at least 30% of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B Notes then
outstanding or if so directed by a Class B Extraordinary Resolution of the Class B Noteholders shall (subject, in each case,
to being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction in accordance with the Note Trust Deed) give a notice (a Class B
**_Note Acceleration Notice) to the Issuer declaring all of the Class B Notes immediately due and payable at any time after_**
the occurrence of any of the following events or circumstances specified below (each such event or circumstance, a Class

binding on it under any Class B Notes, Note Trust Deed, the Issuer Deed of Charge or any of the other Transaction

of Charge, the Issuer Security Trustee), capable of remedy, but which remains unremedied for a period of 21 days
following the giving of notice by the Class B Note Trustee (or the Issuer Security Trustee, as applicable) to the
Issuer requiring the same to be remedied and, in either case; provided that the Class B Note Trustee shall have
determined that such event is, in its opinion, materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class B Noteholders; or

(d) an Issuer Insolvency Event; or

(e) the delivery of the Class A Note Acceleration Notice in accordance with Condition 2.3 (Enforceable Security) of
the Class A Conditions; or

(f) it is or will become unlawful for the Issuer to perform or comply with its obligations under or in respect of these
Class B Conditions or any Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

9.2 Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, until the earlier of (i) the date on which all Class A Notes are redeemed
in full and (ii) the date on which the Class A Notes are accelerated, the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances
described in Condition 9.1 above, which otherwise give rise to a Class B Note Event of Default, will not constitute a Class
B Note Event of Default, but will constitute a Class B Trigger Event under Condition 5.2(b).

**10.** **ACCELERATION**

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, upon delivery of a Class B Note Acceleration Notice, the Class B Notes shall
become immediately due and payable at their Principal Amount Outstanding together with accrued interest, if any, Class

instructs it to take enforcement steps in relation to the Issuer Security, the Issuer Security Trustee is required to
give a notice (the Class B Note Enforcement Notice) to the Issuer declaring the whole of the Issuer Security to
be enforceable.

**No Class B Note Events of Default**

11.2 The Issuer, pursuant to the terms of the Note Trust Deed, shall provide on a semi-annual basis written confirmation
to the Class B Note Trustee that no Class B Note Event of Default has occurred.

**12.** **LIMITED RECOURSE**

12.1 Notwithstanding any other Condition or any provision of any Transaction Document, all obligations of the Issuer
to the Class B Noteholders are limited in recourse to the property, assets and undertakings of the Issuer that are the subject
of any security created by the Issuer Deed of Charge (the Issuer Secured Property). If:

(a) there is no Issuer Secured Property remaining which is capable of being realised or otherwise converted into cash;

(b) all amounts available from the Issuer Secured Property have been applied to meet or provide for the relevant
obligations specified in, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Issuer Deed of Charge; and

(c) there are insufficient amounts available from the Issuer Secured Property to pay in full, in accordance with the
provisions of the Issuer Deed of Charge, amounts outstanding under the Class B Notes (including payments of
principal and interest),

remain unpaid (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payments of principal and/or interest in respect of the Class B Notes)
and such unpaid amounts shall be discharged in full and any relevant payment rights shall be deemed to cease.

**13.** **NON-PETITION**

13.1 No Class B Noteholder nor any person acting on behalf of a Class B Noteholder (other than the Class B Note
Trustee or the Issuer Security Trustee or a Receiver), shall have any right to take or initiate any proceedings or steps against
the Issuer to enforce rights under the Transaction Documents including without limitation by way of attachment, execution
or diligence, provided that nothing shall prevent a Class B Noteholder from proving for the full amount owed to it by the
Issuer in the insolvency of the Issuer.

13.2 No Class B Noteholder, nor any person acting on behalf of a Class B Noteholder (other than the Issuer Security
Trustee or any Receiver appointed by the Issuer Security Trustee), shall initiate or join any person in initiating howsoever
an Issuer Insolvency Event and it shall not be entitled to take any steps or proceedings which would result in any of the
provisions described in the Intercreditor Agreement or this Condition not being observed.

**14.** **AMENDMENT,** **SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER**

14.1 The Note Trust Deed contains provisions for the Class B Noteholders of each sub-class to consider any matter
affecting their interests, including any modification of these Class B Conditions or the provisions of any of the Transaction

rights of holders of any Class B Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest, or Additional Amounts or
premium, if any, on any Class B Notes;

(g) impair the rights of any of the Class B Noteholders to institute a suit for the enforcement of any payment on or

14.5 Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Class B Note Trustee may agree, or may direct the Issuer
Security Trustee to agree, without the consent of the Class B Noteholders, to any modification which, in the opinion of the
Class B Note Trustee is:

(a) to correct a manifest error or to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency of a formal, minor or technical nature;

(b) to make any change that would provide the Class B Noteholders with any additional benefits or rights, or that
does not adversely affect the legal rights of any such holder in any material respect;

(c) to allow any member of the Group established or incorporated after the Closing Date to become an Obligor;

249


-----

(d) to provide the issuance of Class B Additional Notes in accordance with Condition 19 (Further Notes and New
_Notes); or_

(e) to provide for a successor Class B Note Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Note Trust Deed.

14.6 Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Class B Note Trustee may also, without the consent of
the Class B Noteholders, determine that a Class B Note Event of Default or a Share Enforcement Event shall not, or shall
not subject to specified conditions, be treated as such.

14.7 Any such modification, waiver, authorisation or determination shall be binding on the Class B Noteholders and,
unless the Class B Note Trustee agrees otherwise, any such modification shall be notified to the Class B Noteholders as
soon as practicable thereafter in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders).

14.8 The Class B Note Trustee shall be entitled to take into account, for the purpose of exercising or performing any
right, power, trust, authority, duty or discretion under or in relation to these Class B Conditions or any of the Transaction
Documents, among other things, to the extent that it considers, in its sole and absolute discretion, it is necessary and/or
appropriate, and/or relevant, any Rating Agency Confirmation (whether or not such confirmation is addressed to, or
provides that it may be relied upon by, the Class B Note Trustee and irrespective of the method by which such confirmation
is conveyed).

14.9 Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement in connection with any such substitution of principal debtor
as is referred to in Condition 5.3 (Optional Redemption for taxation or other reasons), the Class B Note Trustee and the
Issuer Security Trustee may also agree, without the consent of the Class B Noteholders, to a change in the laws governing
the Class B Notes, these Class B Conditions and/or the Transaction Documents, provided that such change would not, in
the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class B Noteholders.

14.10 Where the Class B Note Trustee is required to have regard to the interests of the Class B Noteholders, it shall have
regard to the interests of such Class B Noteholders as a class and, in particular but without prejudice to the generality of
the foregoing, shall not have regard to, or be in any way liable for, the consequences of such exercise for individual Class
B Noteholders resulting from their being for any purpose domiciled or resident in, or otherwise connected with, or subject
to the jurisdiction of, any particular territory, and the Class B Note Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any
Class B Noteholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer to any other person, any indemnification or payment in respect of
any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Class B Noteholders.

14.11 If and wherever the Issuer shall have issued and have outstanding more than one sub-class of Class B Notes, the
provisions of this Condition 14 shall have effect subject to the following modifications:

(a) a resolution which, in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee, affects only one sub-class of Class B Notes shall
be deemed to be duly approved if approved through a single vote of the holders of that sub-class of Class B Notes;

(b) a resolution which, in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee, affects the holders of more than one sub-class of
Class B Notes but does not give rise to a conflict of interest between the holders of any sub-class of Class B Notes
so affected shall be deemed to have been duly approved if approved through (as a single Class) a vote of the
holders of all the sub-classes of Class B Notes so affected;

(c) a resolution which, in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee, affects the holders of more than one sub-class of
Class B Notes and gives or may give rise to a conflict of interest between the holders of one sub-class of Class B
Notes so affected and the holders of another sub-class of Class B Notes shall be deemed to have been duly
approved only if approved through a separate vote of the holders of each of the sub-classes of Class B Notes;

(d) in respect of all approvals all the preceding provisions of this Condition shall apply mutatis mutandis as though
references to Class B Notes and Class B Noteholders were references to the sub-class of Class B Notes in question
or to the holders of such sub-class of Class B Notes, as the case may be; and

(e) no Class B Extraordinary Resolution involving a Class B Basic Terms Modification (other than where such Class
B Basic Terms Modification affects only one sub-class of Class B Notes) that is approved by the holders of one
sub-class of Class B Notes shall be effective unless it is approved by a Class B Extraordinary Resolution of the
holders of each other sub-class of Class B Notes (to the extent there are Class B Notes outstanding in each such
other sub-class).

**15.** **INDEMNIFICATION AND EXONERATION OF THE CLASS B** **NOTE TRUSTEE AND THE ISSUER SECURITY**
**TRUSTEE**

15.1 The Note Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement contain provisions governing the responsibility (and relief
from responsibility) of the Class B Note Trustee and the Issuer Security Trustee, respectively, and providing for their
indemnification in certain circumstances, including provisions relieving them from taking enforcement proceedings or, in
the case of the Issuer Security Trustee, enforcing the Issuer Security unless indemnified and/or secured to their satisfaction.

15.2 The Note Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement also contain provisions pursuant to which the Class B Note
Trustee and the Issuer Security Trustee and their related companies are entitled, amongst other things, to (a) enter into
business transactions with the Issuer and/or any other party to any of the Transaction Documents and to act as trustees for
the holders of any other securities issued or guaranteed by, or relating to, the Issuer and/or any other party to any of the
Transaction Documents, (b) exercise and enforce its rights, comply with its obligations and perform its duties under or in
relation to any such transactions or, as the case may be, any such trusteeship without regard to the interests of, or
consequences for, the Class B Noteholders, and (c) retain and not be liable to account for any profit made or any other
amount or benefit received thereby or in connection therewith.

**16.** **REPLACEMENT OF CLASS B** **NOTES**

If any Class B Note is mutilated, defaced, lost, stolen or destroyed, it may be replaced at the specified office of the Paying
Agent. Replacement of any mutilated, defaced, lost, stolen or destroyed Class B Note will only be made on payment of
such costs, by the respective Class B Noteholder, as may be incurred in connection therewith and on such terms as to
evidence and indemnity as the Issuer may reasonably require. Mutilated or defaced Class B Notes must be surrendered
before new ones will be issued.

**17.** **NOTICE TO CLASS B** **NOTEHOLDERS**

17.1 Any notice shall be deemed to have been duly given to the Class B Noteholders if sent to the Clearing Systems
for communication by them to the holders of the Class B Notes and shall be deemed to be given on the date on which it
was so sent and shall also be published in the following manner. In respect of Class B Definitive Notes, any notice to the
Class B Noteholders shall be validly given if published in a leading daily newspaper printed in the English language and
with general circulation in London and Ireland (which is expected to be the Financial Times and in the Irish Times,
respectively) and (so long as the relevant Class B Notes are admitted to trading on and listed on an exchange), any notice
shall also be published in accordance with the relevant listing rules and regulations of such exchange.

17.2 Class B Noteholders will be deemed for all purposes to have notice of the contents of any notice given to the
holders of Class B Notes in accordance with this Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders).

17.3 A copy of each notice given in accordance with this Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders) shall be
provided to the Rating Agencies, and to the Irish Stock Exchange, for so long as the Class B3 Notes and the Class B4 Notes
are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (to the extent required by the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange)
and to The International Stock Exchange for so long as the Class B5 Notes are listed on The International Stock Exchange
to the extent required by the listing rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited.

17.4 The Class B Note Trustee shall be at liberty to sanction some other method of giving notice to the Class B
Noteholders if, in its opinion, such other method is reasonable having regard to market practice then prevailing and to the
requirements of the stock exchange on which the relevant Class B Notes are then admitted to trading and listed and provided
that notice of such other method is given to the Class B Noteholders in such manner as the Class B Note Trustee shall
require.

**18.** **NOTIFICATION**

As soon as practicable after becoming aware that any part of a payment of interest or principal on the Class B Notes will
be deferred or that a payment previously deferred will be made in accordance with these Class B Conditions, the Issuer
will give notice thereof to the Class B Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders), and
to the Irish Stock Exchange, for so long as the Class B3 Notes and the Class B4 Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange
(to the extent required by the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange).

**19.** **FURTHER NOTES AND NEW NOTES**

**Class B Further Notes and Class B New Notes**

19.1 (a)The Issuer may, without the consent of the Class B Noteholders, but subject always to the provisions of these

Class B Conditions and the Note Trust Deed, at its option, raise further funds, from time to time, on any date by
the creation and issue of:

(i) further Class B Notes carrying the same terms and conditions in all respects (or in all respects except in
relation to the first Note Interest Period and first Note Interest Payment Date, the issue date, first coupon
and initial Principal Amount Outstanding) as, and so that the same shall be consolidated and form a single
series and rank pari passu with, any sub-class of the Class B Notes (the Class B Further Notes); and/or

(ii) new Class B Notes which may equally have terms and conditions that differ from the Class B3 Notes,
the Class B4 Notes and the Class B5 Notes and which do not form a single series with the Class B3
Notes, the Class B4 Notes or the Class B5 Notes (the Class B New Notes).

(b) It shall be a condition precedent to issue any Class B Further Notes and/or Class B New Notes (together, the Class
**_B Additional Notes) that:_**

(i) the aggregate principal amount of all such Class B Additional Notes to be issued on such date is not less
than £5.0 million;

(ii) in respect of any Class B Further Notes, the Rating Agencies have confirmed that such Class B Further
Notes are assigned the same ratings (or better) as are then applicable to the Class B Notes with which
they are to be consolidated and form a single series;

(iii) the Rating Agencies have provided a Rating Agency Confirmation in respect of the Class B Notes in
relation to the issue of Class B Further Notes or, as the case may be, Class B New Notes (provided that
no such Rating Agency Confirmation is required on the then existing Class B Notes where the purpose
of the Class B New Notes and the related loan to the Borrowers under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement is to refinance a Class B Loan and a sub-class of Class B Notes in full);

(iv) an amount equal to the gross proceeds of such Class B Further Notes or, as the case may be, the Class B
New Notes (with an amount in respect of any issue expenses or commissions agreed to be paid by way
of fee by the Borrowers pursuant to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) is applied by the
Issuer to make a loan to the Borrowers pursuant to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the
conditions precedent therein for an advance under any Additional Class B Facilities are satisfied;

(v) the Class B Note Trustee has received a legal opinion satisfactory to it in relation to, inter alia, the issue
of the Class B Further Notes, or as the case may be, the Class B New Notes from a reputable international
law firm; and

(vi) no Class B Note Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (which has not been waived) or would
occur as a result of such issue.

(c) Nothing in this Condition 19 (Class B Further Notes and Class B New Notes) prohibits the Issuer from issuing
Class A Further Notes and/or Class A New Notes in accordance with the Class A Conditions.

**Deeds and Security**

19.2 Any such Class B Additional Notes will be constituted by a further deed or deeds supplemental to the Note Trust
Deed and have the benefit of the security constituted by the Issuer Deed of Charge. Any of the Transaction Documents
may be amended as provided in Condition 2.1(c) (Status and relationship between the Class B Notes) or otherwise, and
further Transaction Documents may be entered into, in connection with the issue of such Class B Additional Notes and the
claims of any of the parties to any amended Transaction Document or any further Transaction Document may rank pari
_passu with or behind, the Class B Notes, provided, in each case, that the conditions set out in Condition 19.1(a) have been_
satisfied, mutatis mutandis.

252


-----

**20.** **CLASS B** **CALL OPTION**

20.1 The Class B Notes are issued with the benefit of the Class B Call Option (as defined in and set out in the
Intercreditor Agreement).

20.2 If a Class B Call Option Trigger Event occurs, then subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Class B
Call Option and the other terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Class B Noteholder will be entitled (but not obliged)
to purchase all (but not some only) of the then outstanding Class A Notes at a price equal to the then aggregate Principal
Amount Outstanding of the Class A Notes together with accrued but unpaid interest.

20.3 Following notification of the occurrence of any Class B Call Option Trigger Event by or on behalf of the Issuer
to the Class B Noteholders (such notification, the Class B Call Option Notice), any Class B Noteholders who wish to
exercise the Class B Call Option must comply with the terms (as to procedures and timing for payment and settlement) set
out in the Class B Call Option Notice in order to purchase the Class A Notes in such proportions as the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement may specify.

**21.** **SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE**

21.1 The Class B Notes of a sub-class, and the rights of the Class B Note Trustee and the Class B Noteholders under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Issuer Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be of further effect as to
all outstanding Class B Notes of such sub-class when (1) (i) all the Class B Notes of such sub-class have become due and
payable or (ii) are scheduled to be redeemed at the relevant Class B Note Expected Maturity Date in accordance with
Condition 5.2(a) (Redemption) within one year, or (iii) will become due and payable at the relevant Class B Note Final
Maturity Date within one year or (iv) are to be called for redemption or prepayment within one year under arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to the Class B Note Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Issuer Security Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by
the Issuer Security Trustee for this purpose), an amount in Sterling sufficient to pay and discharge the entire outstanding
principal amount on the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes, together with any redemption premium, if any, accrued and
unpaid interest, Class B3 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B4 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B5 Deferred
Interest Amounts (as applicable) in respect of such sub-class of Class B Notes, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon, to the date of deposit (in the case of Class B Notes that have become due and payable), or to the relevant Class B
Note Expected Maturity Date, the relevant Class B Note Final Maturity Date or prepayment date, as the case may be; (3)
the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Class B Conditions with respect to the relevant
sub-class of Class B Notes; (4) the Issuer has delivered an irrevocable notice of redemption to the relevant Class B
Noteholders and has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Issuer Security Trustee (or another entity designated or
appointed as agent by the Issuer Security Trustee for this purpose) to apply the funds deposited towards the payment of the
relevant sub-class of Class B Notes, at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has
delivered to the Issuer Security Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate (which the Issuer Security Trustee may rely on without
further inquiry and without liability) to the effect that all conditions precedent under these Class B Conditions relating to
the satisfaction and discharge of the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes have been complied with.

**22.** **NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS,** **OFFICERS,** **EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of Topco or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates,
as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Topco, Issuer or any Guarantor under the Class B Finance
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Class B
Noteholder by accepting a Class B Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Class B Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**23.** **RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES**

No rights are conferred on any person under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of the
Class B Notes or these Class B Conditions, but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party which exists or is
available apart from the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

**24.** **GOVERNING LAW**

Each of the Transaction Documents, the Class B Global Notes and these Class B Conditions (and, in each case, any noncontractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the relevant document) are governed by, and shall be construed
in accordance with, English law (other than the Issuer Jersey Corporate Services Agreement, the Issuer Deed of Charge (to

253


-----

the extent governed by Jersey law), the Security Interest Agreement and the Topco Share Security Agreement, which will
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, Jersey law and Cayman law, respectively).

**25.** **JURISDICTION**

The courts of England are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute including any dispute as to any non-contractual
obligations that may arise out of or in connection with the Class B Notes and the Transaction Documents (save to the extent
governed by Jersey law) to which the Issuer is party and, accordingly, any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in
connection with the Class B Notes and/or the Issuer Transaction Documents may be brought in such courts. The Issuer has
in each of the Issuer Transaction Documents to which it is a party irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE CLASS B5 LOAN**

_Under the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer agreed to make available to the_
_Borrowers on the Sixth Closing Date the facilities as described below. The following is a summary of certain provisions of_
_the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. It is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of the_
_Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. Capitalised terms used, but not defined in this “Description of the Class B5_
_Loan” shall have the meaning given to them in the section “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” or “Terms_
_and Conditions of the Class B Notes” set out in this Offering Memorandum, as applicable._

On the Sixth Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Class B5 Notes will be applied by the Issuer to make
advances to the Borrowers in an aggregate principal amount of £250,000,000, pursuant to the terms of the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the Issuer will provide to the Borrowers secured facilities
in an aggregate principal amount of £250,000,000 with the proceeds of the issue of the Class B5 Notes (the “Class B5
**Facility” and the advance thereunder, the “Class B5 Loan”), which will be contractually subordinated to the Class A**
Facilities pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The economic terms and conditions of the Class B5 Facility (including, among other things, in relation to the
payment of interest and the repayment and prepayment of principal) will be broadly similar to the terms and conditions of
the Class B5 Notes.

On the Fourth Closing Date, the Issuer issued the Class B3 Notes and the Class B4 Notes (collectively, the
“Existing **Class B** **Notes”). Pursuant to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer provided to the Borrowers**
secured facilities in an aggregate principal amount of £480,000,000 with the proceeds of the issue of the Class B3 Notes
(the “Class B3 Facility” and the advance thereunder the “Class B3 Loan”) and in an aggregate principal amount of
£250,000,000 with the proceeds of the issue of the Class B4 Notes (the “Class B4 Facility” and the advance thereunder,
the “Class B4 Loan” and together with the Class B3 Loan, collectively, the “Existing **Class B** **Loans”), which are each**
contractually subordinated to the Class A Facilities pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Class B3 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full by 28 August 2022 (the “Class B3 Note Expected
**Maturity Date”). The Class B4 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full by 28 August 2025 (the “Class B4 Note**
**Expected Maturity Date”). The Class B3 Loan is expected to be redeemed in full by 24 August 2022 (the “Class B3**
**Loan Expected Maturity Date”) and the Class B4 Loan is expected to be redeemed in full by 25 August 2025 (the “Class**
**B4 Loan Expected Maturity Date” and together with the Class B3 Loan Expected Maturity Date, and the Class B5 Loan**
Expected Maturity Date (as defined below), each a “Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date”).

**REPAYMENT**

The Borrowers must repay the Class B5 Loan in full on the Class B5 Loan Final Maturity Date to the extent not
repaid, prepaid or otherwise discharged in full prior to that date.

The occurrence of the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date does not in and of itself result in any outstanding
principal amounts under the Class B5 Loan becoming due. However, if, on the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date the
Class B5 Loan remains outstanding, Topco will be required, under the terms of the Topco Payment Undertaking, to procure
the payment of an amount equal to the aggregate of:

(a) the then outstanding aggregate principal balance on the Class B Loans;

(b) accrued but unpaid interest then outstanding in respect of the Class B Loans;

(c) any Additional Amounts; and

(c) all other amounts due and payable (including, without limitation, premium and interest on overdue
amounts) by the Obligors to the Issuer under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

Failure by Topco to pay such amount will give the right to the Borrower Security Trustee (on instruction from
the Class B Note Trustee as directed by the Class B Noteholders) to enforce the Topco Security granted to it (on trust for
the Issuer) by Topco over the shares Topco holds in Holdco and the shares Holdco holds in Intermediate Holdco, in each
case in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**PREPAYMENT**

**Optional prepayment**

At any time prior to 28 August 2022, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions prepay up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Class B5 Loan at a prepayment price equal to       % of the principal amount of the

255


-----

Class B5 Loan prepaid upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the date of prepayment (subject to the rights of the Issuer to receive interest on the relevant Loan
Interest Payment Date), with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the initial Class B5 Loan remains outstanding
immediately after the occurrence of such prepayment; and

(2) the prepayment occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

Prior to 28 August 2022, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions prepay during each calendar year up
to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Class B5 Loan (including the original principal amount of any
Additional Class B5 Loan), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price of 103.000% of the
principal amount of the Class B5 Loan so prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to,
but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of the Issuer to receive interest due on the relevant
Loan Interest Payment Date).

In addition, at any time prior to 28 August 2022, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions, at their
option, prepay all or a part of the Class B5 Loan upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a prepayment
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Class B5 Loan prepaid, plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of prepayment (subject to the rights of the Issuer to receive
interest due on the relevant Loan Interest Payment Date).

Except as described in the first, second and third paragraphs above and set out under “— Taxes — Repayment
_for taxation reasons”, the Class B5 Loan will not be pre-payable at the Borrowers’ option prior to 28 August 2022._

On or after 28 August 2022, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions prepay all or a part of the Class B5
Loan upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at the prepayment prices (expressed as percentages of
principal amount) set out below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest Amount, if any, and
any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B5 Loan prepaid, to (but excluding)
the applicable date of prepayment, if prepaid during the 12-month period beginning on 28 August of the years indicated
below, subject to the rights of the Issuer to receive interest on the relevant Loan Interest Payment Date:

**Year** **Redemption Price**

2022 ............................................................................................................................................... %
2023 ............................................................................................................................................... %
2024 and thereafter ........................................................................................................................ 100.000%

Unless the Borrowers default on the payment of the prepayment price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Class B5 Loan or portions thereof called for prepayment on the applicable prepayment date.

Any prepayment or notice may, at the Borrowers’ discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent.

Upon any prepayment of the Class B5 Loan pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer will redeem a pro rata portion
of the Class B5 Notes in accordance with the Class B Conditions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer
for the Class B5 Notes, if not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B5 Notes are
validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and purchased pursuant to such tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset
Sale Offer (as applicable) by a Borrower, the Borrowers may prepay the remaining principal amount of the Class B5 Loan,
in whole, but not in part, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (and provided that such notice is
delivered no later than 60 days following the purchase date in respect of such tender offer, Change of Control Offer or
Asset Sale Offer (as applicable)), at a price equal to the purchase price offered to holders of the Class B5 Notes pursuant
to the tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer (as applicable) (which may be less than par), plus accrued
and unpaid interest, Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest Amount, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, and
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B5 Loan prepaid to (but excluding) the applicable date of prepayment. In
accordance with the Class B Conditions, in determining whether at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Class B5 Notes have been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to any tender offer, Change
of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable, Notes owned by an Affiliate of a Borrower or by funds controlled or
managed by any Affiliate of a Borrower, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of
such tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable.

256


-----

**Mandatory Prepayment**

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Borrowers shall, within one Business Day of receipt of any monies
received by the Borrowers under the Topco Payment Undertaking, apply such monies to prepay the maximum amount of
the Class B Loans (together with all accrued and unpaid interest, Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon, and Additional Amounts, if any) that may be prepaid with such monies.

**INTEREST**

The rate of interest on the Class B5 Loan for each Loan Interest Period (as defined below) is the percentage per
annum as follows:

(1) in respect of any Loan Interest Period falling in the period starting on (and including) the Sixth
Closing Date and terminating on (and excluding) the Class B5 Loan Step-Down Date,       % per
annum; and

(2) in respect of any Loan Interest Period falling after (and including) the Class B5 Loan Step-Down
Date up to (but excluding) the Class B5 Loan Final Maturity Date,    % per annum,

(each, the applicable “Class B5 Interest Rate”).

The period from (and including) the Sixth Closing Date to (but excluding) the first Loan Interest Payment Date
and each successive period from (and including) a Loan Interest Payment Date to (but excluding) the next succeeding Loan
Interest Payment Date, is called a “Loan Interest Period”.

**Payment of interest**

Subject to the following three paragraphs, the Borrowers must pay accrued interest on the Class B Loans on
each Loan Interest Payment Date.

From (and including) the Sixth Closing Date to (but excluding) the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date (as
defined below), interest will accrue on any overdue amount of principal or interest (including Additional Amounts, if any)
in respect of the Class B5 Loan at the applicable Class B5 Interest Rate. For the avoidance of doubt, any failure to pay
interest on a Loan Interest Payment Date will not constitute a Class B Loan Event of Default for as long as any Class A
Notes remain outstanding but will constitute a Share Enforcement Event. The “Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date”
will be the date falling three Business Days prior to the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date. The “Class B5 Note Final
**Maturity Date” will be the Note Interest Payment Date falling on 28 August 2050.**

From (and including) the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date, interest will accrue on the principal amount
of the Class B5 Loan at the applicable Class B5 Interest Rate until (but excluding) the Class B5 Loan Final Maturity Date
but such accruing interest will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest being a “Class B5 Loan Deferred
**Interest Amount”) and such Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest Amount shall accrue interest at the then applicable Class B5**
Interest Rate until it is paid by the Borrowers in full. On each Loan Interest Payment Date, interest accrued on the Class B5
Loan Deferred Interest Amount during the immediately preceding Loan Interest Period shall be added to the then
outstanding Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and thereafter paid at the times and in the same manner as the
Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest Amount. The Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon will be payable by the Borrowers only on the earlier of (x) the date on which the Class A Loans are repaid in full
(the “Initial Payment Date”) and (y) the Class B5 Note Final Maturity Date (as defined above); provided that if on the
Initial Payment Date, the Borrowers do not have sufficient cash to pay the Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and
any accrued but unpaid interest thereon in full on such date in accordance with the Borrower Priorities of Payments, any
unpaid Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon will not fall due then but will
continue to be deferred and will only fall due for payment on any subsequent Loan Interest Payment Date to the extent of
the cash available to the Borrowers for such purpose determined in accordance with the Borrower Priorities of Payments.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Class B5 Loan, any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, any Class B5 Loan Deferred
Interest Amount and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon may be repaid prior to the Class B5 Note Final Maturity Date
using (A) New Equity Funds received by the Borrowers, (B) funds available following the enforcement of the Topco
Security, and/or (C) following the enforcement of the Borrower Security Documents to the extent funds are available for
this purpose pursuant to the applicable Priorities of Payments (as described under “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement”)._

-----

**PAYMENTS**

Unless a Class B Finance Document specifies that payments under it are to be made in another manner (including
any payments in specie pursuant to Condition 5.7 of the Class B Conditions), all payments by any Obligor to the Issuer
under the Class B Finance Documents must be made to the Issuer Transaction Account (or such other account as the Issuer
or, following a Class B Loan Event of Default, the Borrower Security Trustee may specify to the Borrowers by not less
than ten Business Days’ prior written notice).

**TAXES**

**Additional Amounts**

In the event that (i) any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes is required to be made from
payments made by the Issuer under or with respect to the Class B5 Notes and (ii) the Issuer is required under the Class B
Conditions to pay additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) on the Class B5 Notes such that the net amounts
received by each holder of Class B5 Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or
deduction in respect of such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in
respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction, the Issuer shall promptly give written notice of
such requirement to the Borrowers and each Borrower will pay such Additional Amounts as specified in such notice as
may be necessary for the Issuer to comply with its obligations under the Class B Conditions.

Each Obligor must make all payments to be made by it under the Class B Finance Documents without any Tax
Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by law.

If an Obligor or the Issuer (or any permitted assignee) is aware that an Obligor must make a Tax Deduction (or
that there is a change in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction), it must promptly notify the other Parties.

If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by an Obligor, the amount of the payment due from the Obligor
will be increased by an amount (also an Additional Amount) that (after making the Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal
to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.

If an Obligor is required to make a Tax Deduction, that Obligor must make the minimum Tax Deduction allowed
by law and must make any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction within the time allowed by law.

Within 30 days of making either a Tax Deduction or a payment required in connection with a Tax Deduction,
the Obligor making that Tax Deduction or payment must deliver to the Issuer evidence satisfactory to the Issuer that the
Tax Deduction has been made or (as applicable) the appropriate payment has been paid to the relevant taxing authority.

**Repayment for taxation reasons**

The Borrowers may repay the Class B5 Loan in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
repayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, Class B5 Loan
Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date fixed for repayment (a
“Tax **Repayment Date”) (subject to the right of the Issuer to receive interest due on the relevant Loan Interest Payment**
Date) and all Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Repayment Date as a result of
the repayment or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer, Borrowers or Guarantors determine in good faith that the Issuer has the
right to redeem the Class B5 Notes upon the occurrence of any of the events listed in Condition 5.3 of the Class B
Conditions as set out in the Note Trust Deed. The Borrowers will promptly notify the Issuer and the Borrower Security
Trustee if they elect to repay the Class B5 Loan pursuant to this covenant. If the Borrowers so elect to repay the Class B5
Loan, the Borrowers will deliver to the Borrower Security Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect
such repayment and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to repay have
been satisfied. The Borrower Security Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction
of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on
the Borrowers and thereafter the Borrowers must repay or prepay the Class B5 Loan in full on the date specified in the next
paragraph below and the Issuer will redeem all of the Class B5 Notes in accordance with the Class B Conditions.

The date for repayment or prepayment of the Class B5 Loan will be the earlier of:

(i) the relevant Loan Interest Payment Date in respect of the then current Loan Interest Period; or

(ii) the date specified by the respective Borrowers in their notification.

258


-----

**CLASS B CHANGE OF CONTROL**

If a Class B Change of Control occurs with respect to any sub-class of Class B Notes, the Borrowers will make
an offer to the holders of such sub-class of Class B Notes (a “Class B Change of Control Offer”) to repurchase all or any
part (equal to £100,000 or an integral multiple of £1,000 in excess thereof) of the Class B Notes held by such holders. In
the Class B Change of Control Offer, the Borrowers will offer a payment equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount
of Class B Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, the applicable Class B Note Deferred Interest Amount, if
any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B Notes of such sub-class
repurchased to the date of purchase (the “Class B Change of Control Payment”), subject to the rights of holders of the
Class B Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date; provided, however,
that the Borrowers will not be obliged to repurchase the Class B Notes as described under this “— Class B Change of
_Control” covenant in the event and to the extent that any Borrower has unconditionally exercised its right to prepay all of_
the Class B Loans as described under “— Prepayment — Optional prepayment” or all conditions to such repurchase have
been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Borrowers have unconditionally exercised their right to repay the Class B Loans in full as set out in
“— Prepayment — Optional prepayment” (and all of the relevant Class B Notes have been correspondingly redeemed by
the Issuer) or all conditions to such repayment have been satisfied or waived, within 30 days following any Class B Change
of Control, the Borrowers will be obliged to deliver a notice to the Issuer, the Class B Note Trustee and each holder of the
Class B Notes to which such Class B Change of Control applies in accordance with the Class B Conditions, stating:

(1) that a Class B Change of Control Offer is being made and that all Class B Notes tendered will be
accepted for payment;

(2) the purchase price and the prepayment date, which shall be no earlier than 10 days and no later than
60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the “Class B Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) that any Class B Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) that, unless the Borrowers default in the payment of the Class B Change of Control Payment, all
Class B Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Class B Change of Control Offer will cease to
accrue interest after the Class B Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that holders of Class B Notes electing to have any Class B Notes purchased pursuant to a Class B
Change of Control Offer will be required to transfer the Class B Notes to the nominated account as
specified in the notice of the Class B Change of Control Offer;

(6) that holders of Class B Notes will be entitled to withdraw their election if they deliver notice to the
Borrower (at such facsimile number or address as specified in the notice of the Class B Change of
Control Offer), not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Class B
Change of Control Payment Date, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the
holder of Class B Notes, the principal amount of Class B Notes delivered for purchase, and a
statement that such holder is withdrawing its election to have the Class B Notes purchased; and

(7) that holders of Class B Notes whose Class B Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued
new Class B Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Class B Notes
surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to £100,000 in principal amount or an
integral multiple of £1,000 in excess thereof.

The Borrowers will be required to comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those
laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the purchase of the Class B Notes as a result of a Class B Change
of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions described in
this section, the Borrowers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached their obligations under the provisions described in this section by virtue of such compliance.

On the Class B Change of Control Payment Date, to the extent lawful:

(1) the Borrowers will accept for purchase all or portions of Class B Notes properly tendered pursuant
to the Class B Change of Control Offer;

(2) the Borrowers will deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Class B Change
of Control Payment in respect of all or portions of the Class B Notes properly tendered by such
holder for payment into the account of each tendering holder of Class B Notes (as specified in such
holder’s acceptance of the Class B Change of Control Offer) no later than five days after the Class B

259


-----

Change of Control Payment Date and no later than 60 days from the date the notice set forth in the
second paragraph of this covenant has been mailed to holders of Class B Notes to which such
Class B Change of Control applies; and

(3) the Borrowers will deliver or cause to be delivered to the Issuer (in satisfaction, prepayment and
discharge of a pro rata portion of each Borrowers’ liability under the Class B Loans) the Class B
Notes properly accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Class B Notes being purchased by the Borrowers and the Issuer shall then deliver such
Class B Notes to the Principal Paying Agent and shall take all other actions and deliver all
documents and certificates as are required under the Note Trust Deed or requested by the Principal
Paying Agent to effect a cancellation of such Class B Notes.

The Borrowers will not be required to make a Class B Change of Control Offer with respect to any sub-class of
Class B Notes upon a Class B Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Class B Change of Control Offer for such
sub-class of Class B Notes in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set out in the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement applicable to a Class B Change of Control Offer made by the Borrowers and
purchases all Class B Notes of such sub-class properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Class B Change of Control
Offer or (2) notice of redemption with respect to such sub-class has been given pursuant to “— Prepayment — Optional
_prepayment”, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price by the Borrowers in_
connection with the repayment of the relevant Class B Loans, or by the Issuer in connection with the redemption of a pro
rata portion of the relevant Class B Notes.

The Issuer will be required to cooperate with the Borrowers in connection with any Class B Change of Control
Offer (including, without limitation, by delivering such notices to the Class B Note Trustee and the holders of Class B
Notes to which such Class B Change of Control applies as the Borrowers may require in order to enable the Borrowers to
comply with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph), and the Borrowers will bear the cost of any such Class B Change
of Control Offer.

**CERTAIN COVENANTS**

**Class B Financial Covenant**

_Required Class B FCF DSCR_

Prior to the occurrence of the Existing Class B Loans Discharge Date, subject to “— Cure right” as set out
below, the Borrowers must ensure that, on each Financial Covenant Test Date (other than, so long as the Class B Waiver
End Date has not occurred, the Financial Covenant Test Dates occurring in August 2020, February 2021 and August 2021),
the ratio of Class B FCF to the Class B Total Debt Service Charges (such ratio, expressed as a percentage, the “Class B
**FCF DSCR”) for the applicable FCF DSCR Period is equal to or greater than 100%.**

In respect of the calculation of the Class B FCF DSCR on the first and second Financial Covenant Test Date
after the Fourth Closing Date, the Class B Total Debt Service Charges will be deemed to be equal to the actual annualised
Consolidated Interest Expense payable by Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries with effect from the Fourth Closing Date.

For these purposes each of Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall set their relevant Accounting Periods such
that the end date of the Accounting Period immediately preceding each Financial Covenant Test Date shall be a date which
is not more than 12 weeks prior to such Financial Covenant Test Date.

_Cure right_

If:

(1) as at a Financial Covenant Test Date (as described in this paragraph, the “Relevant Financial
**Covenant Test Date”), the Class B FCF DSCR is less than 100%;**

(2) within the period of 30 days thereafter, the Borrowers procure that either:

(A) the Class A Loans and/or the Class B Loans are prepaid in part; and/or

(B) funds are deposited into (or remain in) the Defeasance Account,

using or having been funded by New Equity Funds (the amount so prepaid or deposited, the
“Class B Specified Amount”); and

(3) the Recalculated Class B FCF DSCR is not less than 100%,

260


-----

then for all purposes thereafter (including, without limitation, as to any determination of the occurrence of a Share
Enforcement Event or a Class B Loan Event of Default) the Class B FCF DSCR as at the Relevant Financial Covenant
Test Date shall be deemed to have been the same as the Recalculated Class B FCF DSCR.

The Borrower Security Trustee must, as soon as is reasonably practicable after being so requested, but in any
event not earlier than the Business Day immediately following the Relevant Financial Covenant Test Date, consent to the
release of funds from the Defeasance Account (deposited in the Defeasance Account pursuant to the preceding paragraph)
if and to the extent that, following such release, the Recalculated Class B FCF DSCR (disregarding the Class B Specified
Amount (if any) requested to be so released) remains at or greater than 100% (as certified by CP Opco in the Class B
Compliance Certificate to be provided in connection with such Relevant Financial Covenant Test Date).

**Limitation on Financial Indebtedness**

Topco will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Financial
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), _provided,_ _however, that Topco and any Obligor may Incur Financial_
Indebtedness if the Issuer obtains a Rating Agency Confirmation in respect of the Class B Notes.

The provisions described in the preceding paragraph will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Financial
Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Financial Indebtedness”):

(i) Financial Indebtedness Incurred by any Obligor pursuant to any Credit Facility (including letters of
credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created under any Credit Facility), and any Refinancing
Financial Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Financial Indebtedness,
in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding (1) prior to the
Existing Class B Loans Discharge Date, the greater of £50.0 million and 25.0% of EBITDA or (2)
on and after the Existing Class B Loans Discharge Date, the greater of £60.0 million and 25.0% of
EBITDA plus in the case of any refinancing of any Financial Indebtedness permitted under this
clause (i) or any portion thereof, fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and
expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(ii)

(A) Guarantees by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Financial Indebtedness of
Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in each case so long as the Incurrence of
such Financial Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement; or

(B) without limiting the provisions described in “— Limitations on Liens”, Financial
Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person
securing Financial Indebtedness of Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries so long
as the Incurrence of such Financial Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(iii) Financial Indebtedness of Topco owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Financial
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by Topco or by any Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided, however, that:_

(A) if any Obligor is the obligor of such Financial Indebtedness and the payee is not an
Obligor, such Financial Indebtedness must be unsecured and expressly subordinated to
the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement to the prior payment in full of the
Obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(B) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in
any such Financial Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than Topco
or a Restricted Subsidiary of Topco; and

(C) any sale or other transfer of any such Financial Indebtedness to a Person other than
Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary of Topco,

shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Financial
Indebtedness by Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, not permitted
as described in this clause (iii);

(iv) any Financial Indebtedness represented by (A) the Class A Loans and the Class B Loans (other than
any Additional Class A Loans and Additional Class B Loan), (B) any Financial Indebtedness (other

(b) Incurred to provide all or any portion of the funds utilised to consummate the transaction or
series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
otherwise acquired by Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary of Topco or Incurred otherwise in
connection with or contemplation of such acquisition; provided, however, with respect to this clause
(v), that at the time of such acquisition or other transaction pursuant to which such Financial
Indebtedness was deemed to be Incurred (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be greater than
2.0 to 1.0 after giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction or (y) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition
or other transaction on a pro forma basis;

(vi) Financial Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity
Hedging Agreements entered into for bona fide hedging purposes of Topco or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries and not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
or senior management of Intermediate Holdco);

the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets and (c) any
Refinancing Financial Indebtedness in respect of (a) or (b), in an aggregate outstanding principal
amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other Financial Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to this clause (vii) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any time the greater
of (A) £50.0 million and (B) 3.0% of Total Assets;

(viii) [reserved];

purposes of making Class B Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (i), (vi) and

-----

Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding the
greater of £50.0 million and 25.0% of EBITDA.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Financial
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, the covenant described in this section:

(i) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Financial Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Financial Indebtedness shall not be included;

(ii) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any credit facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clauses (i), (vii)
or (xii) of the second paragraph of this covenant and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
other similar instruments relate to other Financial Indebtedness, then such other Financial
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(iii) [reserved];

(iv) Financial Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be Incurred solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Financial Indebtedness but may be Incurred in part by one such provision
and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Financial Indebtedness;

(v) the amount of Financial Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof
will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS;

(vi) for the avoidance of doubt, the Incurrence of any Financial Indebtedness by Topco will only be
permitted if it also complies with the provisions described in “— Limitation on Holding Company
_Activities”;_

(vii) subject to clause (viii) below, in the event that Financial Indebtedness meets the criteria of more
than one of the types of Financial Indebtedness described in first and second paragraphs of this
covenant, Topco, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item
of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in the
first paragraph or second paragraph of this covenant; provided, that Financial Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to clause (i) of the second paragraph of this covenant may not be reclassified provided
further that on and after the Existing Class B Loans Discharge Date, this limitation on
reclassification shall only apply to Financial Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (i) of the
second paragraph of this covenant that was outstanding on the Sixth Closing Date;

(viii) all Financial Indebtedness outstanding on the Sixth Closing Date under the Class A Loans and the
Class B Loans shall be deemed initially Incurred on the Sixth Closing Date under clause (iv)(A) of
the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph of this covenant or clause (iv)(B)
of the second paragraph of this covenant, and without limiting any permitted refinancing pursuant
to clause (iv)(C) of the second paragraph of this covenant, may not be reclassified pursuant to clause
(vii) of this paragraph; and

(ix) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortisation of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Financial Indebtedness, the payment of dividends on
Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Preferred Stock or Disqualified
Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Financial Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS
will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Financial Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. The amount of any
Financial Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (i) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Financial
Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (ii) the principal amount or liquidation preference thereof, in the case
of any other Financial Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Financial Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of Topco as of such date (and, if such Financial
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, Topco shall be in default of this covenant).

-----

For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Financial Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of Financial Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Financial Indebtedness
was Incurred, in the case of term Financial Indebtedness, or, at the option of Topco, first committed, in the case of Financial
Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; _provided that (i) if such Financial Indebtedness is Incurred to_
refinance other Financial Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and such refinancing would cause
the applicable sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect
on the date of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long
as the principal amount of such Refinancing Financial Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Financial
Indebtedness being refinanced; (ii) the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Financial Indebtedness
outstanding on the Fourth Closing Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
Fourth Closing Date and the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Financial Indebtedness outstanding
on the Sixth Closing Date (that was not outstanding on the Fourth Closing Date) shall be calculated based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the Sixth Closing Date; and (iii) if and for so long as any such Financial Indebtedness
is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Financial Indebtedness is denominated
covering principal and interest on such Financial Indebtedness, the amount of such Financial Indebtedness, if denominated
in sterling, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise,
the Sterling Equivalent of such amount plus the Sterling Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable
but is not covered by such Currency Agreement. For purposes of calculating compliance with clause (i) of the second
paragraph (of this covenant or for calculating the amount of Financial Indebtedness outstanding under any Credit Facility,
to the extent a Credit Facility is utilised for the purpose of Guaranteeing or cash collateralising any letter of credit or
Guarantee, such Guarantee or collateralising and issuance of such letter of credit or Guarantee shall be deemed to be a
utilisation of such Credit Facility permitted under clause (i) of the second paragraph above.

Subject to the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, any Borrower may at any time serve
written notice to the Issuer with a copy to the Borrower Security Trustee requesting from the Issuer such further and/or
additional term loan facilities, each in a maximum aggregate principal amount not exceeding the principal amount of any
issue of Class B Additional Notes issued by the Issuer to fund its obligations under the Class B Issuer/ Borrower Loan
Agreement in respect of the relevant additional Class B Facility (each an “Additional Class B Facility”) if the following
conditions are satisfied (as certified by the Borrower), or will be satisfied by the time of such issue:

(1) the aggregate amount of any Additional Class B Facility is to be for a minimum aggregate principal
amount of £5.0 million;

(2) the conditions to the issue by the Issuer of the corresponding Class B Additional Notes have been
satisfied, or will be satisfied by the time of such issue;

(3) the payment of interest and principal with respect to any such Additional Class B Facilities will rank
pari passu with or after any then outstanding Class B Facility; and

(4) the Incurrence of Financial Indebtedness under such Additional Class B Facility is permitted under
“— Limitation on Financial Indebtedness”.

Notwithstanding the provisions described above, the maximum amount of Financial Indebtedness that Topco or
a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur under the provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement shall not be
deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Financial Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Financial Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Financial Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the
currencies in which such Refinancing Financial Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of the relevant
refinancing.

each case, as provided in the definition of Investment) not to exceed, in the case of any
Unrestricted Subsidiary, the amount of Investments previously made by Topco or any

Financial Indebtedness or other obligations owed to an Obligor;

270

(iii) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to an Obligor;

_provided that (A) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends_
or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (B) the subordination of (including the application of any
standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Financial Indebtedness
Incurred by Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions described in the paragraph above will not prohibit:

(i) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (A) any Credit Facility or (B) any other agreement or
instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Fourth Closing Date, including the

**Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement**
referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph or this clause (iii); _provided,_ _however, that the_
encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such
agreement or instrument are no less favourable in any material respect to the holders of the Class B
Notes, taken as a whole, than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement
or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification
relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of Intermediate Holdco);

(iv) any encumbrance or restriction:

(A) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, licence or similar contract, or the assignment
or transfer of any lease, licence or other contract;

(B) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under
the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or securing Financial Indebtedness of

regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(ix) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(x) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or
Commodity Hedging Agreements;

(xi) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Financial Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Sixth Closing Date as described
in “— Limitation on Financial Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any
such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favourable to the holders of
the Class B Notes than (A) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, together with
the security documents associated therewith as in effect on the Sixth Closing Date; (B) any
encumbrance or restriction contained in any Credit Facility, together with the security documents
associated therewith as in effect on the Sixth Closing Date or (C) as is customary in comparable
financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of Intermediate Holdco); or

(xii) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted as described in
“— Limitations on Liens”.

**Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets**

Topco will not, directly or indirectly: (i) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not Topco
is the surviving corporation), or (ii) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole in one or more related transactions, to
another Person, unless:

(i) either:

(A) Topco is the surviving corporation; or

(B) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than
Topco) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other
disposition has been made is an entity organised or existing under the laws of:

(I) a member state of Pre-Expansion European Union;

(II) Switzerland;

(III) Guernsey;

(IV) the Cayman Islands; or

(V) the United States;

(ii) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger with Topco or the Person to
which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made (in each
case, if other than an Obligor) assumes all the obligations of Topco under the Class B Notes, the
Class B Loans, the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Borrower Security Documents;

(iii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Class B Loan Default, Share Enforcement
Event or Class B Loan Event of Default, as the case may be, exists; and

(iv) Topco or the Person surviving any such consolidation or merger has obtained a Rating Agency
Confirmation.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (iii) and (iv) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this
sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of Topco may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or

272


-----

part of its properties and assets to Topco, (b) any Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or
transfer all or part of its properties and assets to Topco, a Borrower or a Guarantor and (c) Topco may consolidate or
otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organised for the purpose of changing the legal domicile
of Topco, reincorporating Topco in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of Topco.

An Obligor will not directly or indirectly: (A) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not
such Obligor is the surviving Person) or (B) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially
all of its assets to, another Person, unless:

(i) (A) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Class B Loan Default, Share Enforcement
Event or Class B Loan Event of Default, as the case may be, exists and (B) the Person acquiring the
property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation
or merger assumes all the obligations of such Obligor under the Class B Notes, the Class B Loans,
the Class B Issuer/ Borrower Loan Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Borrower
Security Documents; or

(ii) To the extent required by the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Net
Available Cash of such sale or other disposition is applied in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

Notwithstanding clause (i)(A) of the second paragraph of this covenant (which does not apply to transactions
referred to in this sentence), (i) any Obligor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part
of its properties and assets to another Obligor or Topco and (ii) an Obligor may consolidate or otherwise combine with or
merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organised for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Obligor,
reincorporating the Obligor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Obligor.

**Asset Sales**

Topco will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly make any Asset
Sale unless:

(i) Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way
of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the
date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of Intermediate Holdco, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Sale (including for
the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Sale is a Permitted Asset Swap); and

(ii) in any such Asset Sale, or series of related Asset Sales (except to the extent the Asset Sale is a
Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Sale (excluding any
consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Financial Indebtedness) received by Topco or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary
Cash Investments. For the purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(A) the assumption by the transferee of Financial Indebtedness of Topco or Financial
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of
Topco or an Obligor) and the release of Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary from all
liability on such Financial Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale;

(B) securities, notes or other obligations received by Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary of
Topco from the transferee that are converted by Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary
into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale;

(C) Financial Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that Topco and each other
Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Financial
Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale;

(D) consideration consisting of Financial Indebtedness of Topco (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) received after the Fourth Closing Date and that is cancelled from Persons
who are not Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

273


-----

(E) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by Topco or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together
with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant
that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of £36.0 million and 2.0% of
Total Assets (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value); and

(iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Sale is applied by Topco or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(A) to the extent Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is
required by the terms of any Financial Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary), (1) to
prepay, repay, redeem or purchase any Financial Indebtedness under the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, any Financial Indebtedness Incurred under clause
(i) of the second paragraph described under “— Limitation on Financial Indebtedness”
(or any Refinancing Financial Indebtedness in respect thereof) or any other Financial
Indebtedness secured by a first priority Lien on the Collateral within 365 days from the
later of (x) the date of such Asset Sale and (y) the receipt of such Net Available Cash;
_provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment or repayment of Financial_
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (1), Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire
such Financial Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) (except in
the case of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) to be permanently reduced
in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid or repaid; (2) to prepay, repay,
purchase or redeem Financial Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets which do not constitute
Collateral (in each case, other than Subordinated Indebtedness of Topco or a Guarantor
or Indebtedness that is owed to Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary); (3) to purchase the
Class B Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of the Class B Notes at a purchase price
in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount of the relevant sub-class of
Class B Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of
purchase, on such sub-class of Class B Notes; or (4) to prepay, repay, redeem or
purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more than 100% of the principal
amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
such prepayment, repayment or purchase; provided that Topco shall redeem repay or
repurchase Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (4) only if the Borrowers
make (at such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the
holders of the Class B Notes of each sub-class to purchase their Class B Notes in
accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer for an aggregate
principal amount of Class B Notes of the relevant sub-class at least equal to the
proportion that (i) the total aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes outstanding in
such sub-class bears to (ii) the sum of the total aggregate principal amount of Class B
Notes outstanding in such sub-class plus the total aggregate principal amount
outstanding of such Pari Passu Indebtedness as well as the total aggregate principal
amount of any other sub-class of Class B Notes; or

(B) to the extent Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary elects to invest in or commit to invest
in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a
Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by Topco or another Restricted
Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Sale and (2) the
receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such reinvestment in
Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment
approved by the Board of Directors of Intermediate Holdco that is executed or approved
within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is
consummated within 180 days of such 365th day; and provided further, that, if the Asset
Sale relates to Collateral, to the extent such Additional Assets are of the same type as
any asset constituting Collateral, such Additional Assets are substantially,
simultaneously with their acquisition, pledged under the Borrower Security Documents,
with the security interest on such Additional Assets securing the Class B Loans and the
Class B Notes with the same priority with respect to the Class B Loans and the Class B
Notes as the security interest on the Collateral subject to the Asset Sale, provided that
in the case of Net Available Cash received from an Asset Sale of Collateral, none of the

274


-----

Obligors may apply such Net Available Cash to repay Financial Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not an Obligor; or

(C) consummate any combination of the foregoing,

_provided further that pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance_
with clauses (A), (B) or (C), Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Financial
Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

Prior to the Existing Class B Loans Discharge Date, any Net Available Cash from Asset Sales that is not applied
or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in clause (iii) above will be deemed to constitute “Excess
**Proceeds” under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.**

On and after the Existing Class B Loans Discharge Date:

(a) to the extent that the Consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeds 7.5 to 1.00, any Net Available Cash from Asset
Sales that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in clause (iii) above;

(b) to the extent that the Consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeds 7.0 to 1.00 but does not exceed 7.5 to 1.00, 50%
of any Net Available Cash from Asset Sales that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as
provided in clause (iii) above; or

(c) to the extent that the Consolidated Leverage Ratio does not exceed 7.0 to 1.00, 0% of any Net Available
Cash from Asset Sales that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in clause
(iii) above,

will be deemed to constitute Excess Proceeds under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. On or prior
to the 366th day (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in clause (iii)(B) above has been entered into)
after the later of (A) an Asset Sale and (B) the receipt of Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds
under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement exceeds £20.0 million, the Borrowers will be required to make an offer
(or procure that an offer is made) (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of the Class B Notes and, to the extent the
Borrowers elect, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum
principal amount of the Class B Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Sale Offer applies that
may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of each sub-class of Class B Notes in an amount
at least equal to (and, in the case of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal
amount of such sub-class of Class B Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, the applicable Class B Loan Deferred Interest
Amount, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this covenant
or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and in minimum denominations of £100,000 and
in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

Each Asset Sale Offer will remain open for a period of at least 20 Business Days following its commencement
and not more than 30 Business Days, except to the extent that a longer period is required by applicable law (the “Offer
**Period”). No later than three Business Days after the termination of the Offer Period (the “Purchase Date”), the Borrowers**
will apply all Excess Proceeds (the “Offer Amount”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of Class B Notes and, if
applicable, any such Pari Passu Indebtedness (on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount of Class B Notes and such
Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered, if applicable) or, if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Class B Notes
and, if applicable, other Financial Indebtedness tendered in response to the Asset Sale Offer. Payment for any Class B
Notes and, if applicable, any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, so purchased will be made in the same manner as interest
payments are made. If the Purchase Date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the Person in whose name a Class B Note is registered at the
close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to holders of Class B Notes who tender
Class B Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer.

Upon the commencement of an Asset Sale Offer, the Borrowers shall (or upon request of the Borrowers, the
Issuer shall) send, by first class mail, a notice to the Issuer and (for the purposes of information only) to the Borrower
Security Trustee. The notice, which will govern the terms of the Asset Sale Offer, will state:

(i) that the Asset Sale Offer is being made pursuant to this covenant and the length of time the Asset
Sale Offer will remain open;

(ii) the Offer Amount, the purchase price and the Purchase Date;

275


-----

(iii) that any Class B Note not tendered or accepted for payment will continue to accrue interest;

(iv) that, unless the Borrowers default in making such payment, any Class B Note accepted for payment
pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Purchase Date;

(v) that holders of Class B Notes electing to have a Class B Note purchased pursuant to an Asset Sale
Offer may elect to have Class B Notes purchased in integral multiples of £1,000 only (provided that
Class B Notes of £100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part);

(vi) that holders of Class B Notes electing to have Class B Notes purchased pursuant to any Asset Sale
Offer will be required to transfer the Class B Notes to the nominated account as specified in the
notice of the Asset Sale Offer;

(vii) that holders of Class B Notes will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Issuer and/or the
Borrowers receive (at such facsimile number or address as specified in the notice of the Asset Sale
Offer), not later than the expiration of the Offer Period, a facsimile transmission or letter setting
forth the name of the holder of Class B Notes, the principal amount of Class B Notes delivered for
purchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing its election to have the Class B Notes
purchased;

(viii) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness
surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the Offer Amount, the Borrowers will select the Class B
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount
of Class B Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered (with such adjustments as may be
deemed appropriate by the Borrowers so that only Class B Notes in denominations of £1,000, or
integral multiples thereof, will be purchased (provided that Class B Notes of £100,000 or less may
only be redeemed in whole and not in part)); and

(ix) that holders of Class B Notes of any sub-class whose Class B Notes are being purchased only in
part will be issued new Class B Notes of such sub-class equal in principal amount to the unpurchased
portion of the Class B Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to £100,000 in
principal amount or an integral multiple of £1,000 in excess thereof.

On or before the Purchase Date, the Borrowers will, to the extent lawful:

(i) accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Offer Amount of Class B Notes
or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer, or if less than the Offer Amount has
been tendered, all Class B Notes tendered;

(ii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Issuer (in satisfaction, prepayment and discharge of a pro rata
portion of each Borrower’s liability under the applicable Class B Loans) the Class B Notes properly
accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Class B Notes or portions thereof
were accepted for payment by the Borrowers in accordance with the terms of this covenant and the
Issuer shall then deliver such Class B Notes to the Principal Paying Agent and shall take all other
action and deliver all documents and certificates required under the Note Trust Deed or required by
the Principal Paying Agent to effect cancellation of the Class B Notes; and

(iii) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the purchase price in respect of all
Class B Notes or portions of Class B Notes properly tendered by such holder for payment into the
account of each tendering holder of Class B Notes (as specified in such holder’s acceptance of the
Asset Sale Offer) no later than five days after the Purchase Date.

The Issuer shall cooperate with the Borrowers in relation to any Asset Sale Offer, and the Borrowers shall bear
the cost of such Asset Sale Offer (including, without limitation, by delivering such notices to holders of Class B Notes as
the Borrowers may require in order to enable the Borrowers to comply with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph).

If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.
If the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes tendered into (or to be redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale
Offer and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Class B Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on
a pro rata basis, based on the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes of each sub-class and Pari Passu Indebtedness
tendered. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

276


-----

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Class B Notes is denominated in
a currency other than sterling, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Class B Notes shall not exceed the net amount
of funds in sterling that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into sterling.

Following any acceptance by the holders of Class B Notes of any Asset Sale Offer, the Borrowers will be
required to prepay the applicable Class B Loans at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any) in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the aggregate principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any) of the relevant sub-class of
Class B Notes so tendered in such Asset Sale Offer.

**Transactions with Affiliates**

Topco will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to or sell, lease,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or
make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or Guarantee with, or for the benefit of,
any Affiliate of Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or
consideration in excess of £10.0 million, unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favourable to Topco
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of £25.0 million, the
terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors of Intermediate Holdco.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (ii) of the first
paragraph of this covenant if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors. If there
are no Disinterested Directors, any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in this
covenant if Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to the Borrower Security Trustee a
letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary
from a financial point of view or stating that the terms are not materially less favourable to Topco or its relevant Restricted
Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary
with an unrelated Person on an arm’s length basis.

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the
provisions of the first paragraph of this covenant:

(i) any Class B Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the provisions described in
“— Class B Restricted Payments”, any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (ix)(B)
of the definition of Permitted Payments) or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted
Investments as defined in clauses (a)(ii), (b) and (o) of the definition thereof);

(ii) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or
entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan,
programme, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other
compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of Topco,
any Restricted Subsidiary of Topco or any Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans,
stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans
(including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or
similar plans, programmes or arrangements) or payments of customary fees and reimbursements of
expenses to, or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants
approved by the Board of Directors, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(iii) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(iv) any transaction between or among Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or entity that becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries;

(v) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses
provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of Topco, any Restricted

Subsidiary of Topco or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person
owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(vi) the entry into and performance of obligations of Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under
the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding,
any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Fourth Closing Date, as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time
to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous
to the holders of the Class B Notes in any material respect in the good faith judgment of the Board
of Directors of Topco or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary and the entry into and performance of
any registration rights or other listing agreement in connection with any Public Offering;

(vii) the execution, delivery and performance of any tax sharing agreement to the extent not prohibited
by the definition of Permitted Payments or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group
for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of business;

(viii) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, providers of employees or other labour
(including, without limitation, with respect to the management, development, maintenance or
refurbishment of real property and other related services), suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods
or services (including, without limitation, with respect to insurance and reinsurance services), in
each case in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to Topco or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the senior management of
Topco or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favourable than those that could
reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(ix) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among Topco or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of Topco that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because
Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate
of any Permitted Holder owns an Equity Interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate;

(x) (A) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference
Shares) of Topco or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated
Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of such Subordinated
Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in their
reasonable determination and (B) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any
Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(xi) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (xii) hereof, (A) payments by
Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to any Parent or Permitted Holder (whether directly or
indirectly, including through any Parent) of customary annual management, consulting, monitoring
or advisory fees and related expenses and (B) customary payments by Topco or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to any Parent or Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through
any Parent) for financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of
other investment banking activities, including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which
payments in respect of this clause (B) are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors in good
faith;

(xii) payment to any Parent or Permitted Holder of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by
such Parent or Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in Topco and
its Subsidiaries;

(xiii) the Incurrence or amendment of any Subordinated Shareholder Funding;

(xiv) transactions between any of the Obligors and any person, a director of which is also a director of
the relevant Obligor or any direct or indirect parent of such Obligor; provided, however, that such
director abstains from voting as a director of the relevant Obligor or such direct or indirect parent,
as the case may be, on any matter involving such other person;

(xv) any Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisation;

(xvi) the Transaction Documents;

278


-----

(xvii) any transaction that is, directly or indirectly, related to the Ireland Site or an Additional Site and is
otherwise permitted by the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(xviii) any Affiliate Transaction with the Issuer provided it complies with the covenants set forth in the
Note Trust Deed;

(xix) the existence of, or the performance by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations
under the terms of, any stockholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or
purchase agreement related thereto) to which it (or any Parent of the Topco) is a party as of the
Fourth Closing Date and any similar agreements which it (or any Parent of Topco) may enter into
thereafter; provided that the existence of, or the performance by the Topco or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or such Parent) of obligations under any future amendment to any such existing
agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Fourth Closing Date shall only be
permitted by this clause (xx) to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement
are not otherwise disadvantageous in any material respect in the good faith judgment of Topco to
the Class B Lenders when taken as a whole; and

(xx) (i) the Transactions, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of Topco or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and any
payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on
the Fourth Closing Date or described in “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” in
the 2017 Class B Notes Offering Memorandum, as these agreements and instruments may be
amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in
accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the
Class B Noteholders in any material respect, and (iii) the entry into and performance of any
registration rights or other listing agreement.

**Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Certain Financial Indebtedness**

Topco will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to
Guarantee the payment of any Class A Loans, Additional Class A Loans or Financial Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit
Facility of a Guarantor or a Borrower (or, in each case, any Refinancing Financial Indebtedness Incurred in respect thereof)
unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers an accession agreement to the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement providing for the Guarantee of the payment of the Class B Loans and the Class B Notes
by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Guarantee will be pari passu with or junior to such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee
of such Class A Loans, Additional Class A Loans or Financial Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility (or, in each
case, any Refinancing Financial Indebtedness Incurred in respect thereof).

Each such additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognise certain defences generally available to
guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of creditors generally)
or other considerations under applicable law.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to any Guarantees of any Restricted Subsidiary:

(i) existing on the Fourth Closing Date; or

(ii) given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not
less than £250.0 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such Guarantee was given, of at least
“A” or the equivalent thereof by S&P and Fitch, in connection with the operation of cash
management programmes established for the benefit of the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Topco shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee
the payment of the Class B Loans or the Class B Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary
would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in:

(i) a violation of applicable law which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through
measures reasonably available to Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary; or

(ii) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary.

For so long as any Class B Loan is outstanding, Topco will provide to the Borrower Security Trustee and the
Class B Note Trustee (for the benefit of the Class B Noteholders) the following reports:

(i) within 120 days after the end of Intermediate Holdco’s financial year, annual reports containing the
following information: (A) audited consolidated balance sheets of Intermediate Holdco as of the
end of the two most recent financial years and audited consolidated income statements and
statements of cash flow of Intermediate Holdco for the two most recent financial years, including
complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the
financial statements; (B) pro forma income information and balance sheet information of
Intermediate Holdco (which, for the avoidance of doubt shall not include the provision of a full
income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions or dispositions that represent greater than 20% of the
consolidated revenues, EBITDA, or assets of Intermediate Holdco or recapitalisations that have
occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed financial year as to which such annual
report relates; (C) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a
discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of
Intermediate Holdco, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical
accounting policies and (D) a description of material risk factors and material recent developments
of the Group.

(ii) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three financial quarters in each financial year
of Intermediate Holdco, all quarterly reports of Intermediate Holdco containing the following
information: (A) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of such quarter and unaudited
condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter and year-to-date period
ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods,
together with condensed footnote disclosure; (B) pro forma income statement and balance sheet
information of Intermediate Holdco (which, for the avoidance of doubt shall not include the
provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together
with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions or dispositions that represents greater than
20% of the consolidated revenues, EBITDA or assets of Intermediate Holdco or recapitalisations
that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant quarter, in each case unless _pro forma_
information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clauses (i) and (iii) or this clause (ii);
(C) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion
of the results of operations and financial condition, EBITDA, and material changes in liquidity and
capital resources of Intermediate Holdco; and (D) material recent developments of Intermediate
Holdco;

(iii) within ten days after the occurrence of (A) a material acquisition, disposition or restructuring;
(B) any senior management change at Topco; (C) any change in the auditors of Intermediate

(E) any material events that any Obligor announces publicly, in each case, a report containing a
description of such events; and

(iv) on each Semi-Annual Investor Reporting Date, CP Opco must provide details of a telephone
conference into which the Class A Noteholders and Class B Noteholders may dial, on which the
senior management of the Obligors must present their financial results for the relevant period,
_provided that CP Opco shall only be required to hold telephone conferences if so required under the_
Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above will not be required to (A) contain any_
reconciliation to U.S. GAAP or (B) include separate financial statements for any Obligors or any Subsidiaries of
Intermediate Holdco that are not Obligors.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that material differences exist between the results of operations or
financial condition of Topco and Intermediate Holdco, the annual and quarterly reports shall give a reasonably detailed
description of such differences. Topco may at any time elect to become the reporting entity in place of Intermediate Holdco,
after which election, references to the “Intermediate Holdco” in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) and the proviso above shall be
deemed to refer to Topco.

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS. Except as provided for above, no report
need include separate financial statements for the Obligors or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any

280


-----

other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the 2017 Class B Notes Offering Memorandum or in this
Offering Memorandum.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Borrower Security Trustee of the reports specified in clause
(i), (ii) and (iii) above, Topco shall (1) make available copies of all reports required on its website or (2) otherwise provide
substantially comparable public availability of such reports (as determined by the Board of Directors of Intermediate
Holdco in good faith).

For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Class B Note Trustee nor the Borrower Security Trustee shall be
responsible for monitoring or confirming the validity or accuracy of the reports or information delivered pursuant to this
covenant or compliance by Topco with its obligations under this covenant.

In addition, Topco shall furnish to the Class B Noteholders and to prospective investors, upon the request of
such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as
the Class B Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the
Securities Act.

Subject to compliance with the immediately following paragraph of this covenant, in the event that, and for so
long as, the equity securities of Topco or any Parent or IPO Entity are listed on any Qualified Stock Exchange and the
listed entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading
on such Qualified Stock Exchange, for so long as it elects, Topco will make available to the Borrower Security Trustee and
the Class B Note Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that it or such Parent or IPO Entity
is, or would be, required to file with such Qualified Stock Exchange. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements,
and provided that such requirements require Topco or any Parent or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports,
information, documents and other reports with such Qualified Stock Exchange, Topco will be deemed to have complied
with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Topco may also comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this covenant by
providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent of Topco so long as such reports (if an annual,
half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of the first paragraph
of this covenant as if references to the Intermediate Holdco therein were references to such Parent and (b) include
condensed consolidated financial information together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent; (ii) Intermediate Holdco
and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Parent on a combined basis;
(iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement,
Topco will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

**Conduct of Business/Business Activities**

The Obligors will not engage in any business other than a Class B Permitted Business, except to the extent as
would not be material to the Obligors, taken as a whole.

**Limitation on Holding Company Activities**

Topco and Holdco must not carry on any business or own any assets other than:

(i) (a) with respect to Topco, the ownership of Capital Stock of Holdco and (b) with respect to Holdco,
the ownership of Intermediate Holdco;

(ii) conduct of their business as holding companies, including the provision of administrative services
(excluding treasury services but including the on-lending of monies to their respective Restricted
Subsidiaries) and management services to its Subsidiaries of a type customarily provided by a
holding company to its Subsidiaries and the ownership of assets necessary to provide such services;

(iii) activities undertaken with the purpose of fulfilling rights and obligations arising under the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party, asset and liabilities under the Transaction Documents,
and professional fees and administration costs in connection therewith and otherwise in the ordinary
course of business as a holding company;

(iv) credit balances in bank accounts and Investments in cash and Cash Equivalents;

(v) subject to the provisions described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, Incurring
Financial Indebtedness as described in “— Limitation on Financial Indebtedness” (including
activities reasonably incidental thereto, including performance of the terms and conditions of such
Financial Indebtedness, to the extent such activities are otherwise permissible under the Class B

281


-----

Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) and the granting of Liens as described in “— Limitations on
_Liens”;_

(vi) making Investments in the Class B Notes or Financial Indebtedness as described in “— Limitation
_on Financial Indebtedness”;_

(vii) directly related or reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of its or its
Subsidiaries’ corporate existence or for the purpose of transferring such property and assets to any
Parent or other Person;

(viii) activities pursuant to or in connection with the Transactions; or

(ix) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are de minimis in nature or ancillary to or
related to those listed in this covenant.

Neither Topco nor Holdco will, directly or indirectly, Incur any Financial Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness, but excluding any outstanding intercompany Financial Indebtedness existing on the Fourth Closing Date)
other than (i) the Incurrence of obligations or liabilities arising by operation of law, (ii) the Incurrence of liabilities to pay
Taxes and paying Taxes, (iii) the Incurrence such as may arise of liabilities under the Topco Payment Undertaking of the
Topco Transaction Documents, and neither Topco nor Holdco will issue any Disqualified Stock.

Neither Topco nor Holdco will, directly or indirectly, create, Incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist
or become effective any Lien of any kind securing Financial Indebtedness upon any of its property or assets, now owned
or hereinafter acquired, except to secure any Permitted Topco Lien.

Neither Topco nor Holdco will take, or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which action or
omission would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the collateral granted under the
relevant Topco Security Documents (it being understood that the Incurrence of Liens on the Topco Security permitted by
the definition of Permitted Topco Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest
with respect to the Topco Security) for the benefit of the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer, and neither Topco nor
Holdco will grant to any Person other than the Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the Issuer and the other
beneficiaries described in the Topco Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, any interest whatsoever in the Topco Security; _provided that (a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the_
discharge or release of the Topco Security in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Topco
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) Topco and Holdco
may Incur Permitted Topco Liens; provided further, however, that, subject to the foregoing, Topco Security Documents
may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced, or released (followed
by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) unless Topco or Holdco, as
applicable, contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, replacement, restatement, supplement, modification,
renewal or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the assets), delivers to
the Borrower Security Trustee (i) a certificate from the Board of Directors or chief financial officer of the relevant Person
(acting in good faith) that confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, replacement, supplement, modification or release, or (ii) an
opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee (subject to customary
exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing
the Topco Payment Undertaking created under the Topco Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, modified, replaced or released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any
limitation imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to
immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release
and retaking.

**Impairment of Security Interest**

Topco will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or negligently
omit to take, any action which action or omission would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with
respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of
Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect
to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Borrower Security Trustee and the holders of the Class B Notes, and Topco will not,
and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than the Borrower Security
Trustee, for the benefit of the Borrower Security Trustee and the Class B Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the
Borrower Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest
whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge or release of the

282


-----

Collateral in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Borrower Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur
Permitted Collateral Liens; provided further, however, that, subject to the foregoing, no Borrower Security Document may
be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced, or released (followed by an
immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) unless Topco contemporaneously with
such amendment, extension, replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, renewal or release (followed by an
immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the assets), delivers to the Borrower Security Trustee (i) a
certificate from the Board of Directors or chief financial officer of the relevant Person (acting in good faith) that confirms
the solvency of the Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, replacement, supplement, modification or release, or (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming
that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification, replacement or release and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the Class B Loans created under the Borrower
Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced or released and retaken
are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at
law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking.

At the direction of Topco and without the consent of the holders of the Class B Notes, the Borrower Security
Trustee may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Borrower Security Documents to:

(i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein;

(ii) subject to compliance with the provisions described in the first paragraph of this covenant, provide
for Permitted Collateral Liens;

(iii) add to the Collateral; or

(iv) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Class B
Notes in any material respect.

In the event that Topco complies with the provisions described in “— Impairment of Security Interest”, the
Borrower Security Trustee shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release with no need for instructions from the
holders of Class B Notes.

**Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Acquisitions**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Class B Loans, in each case in connection
with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Share Enforcement
Event or Class B Loan Default or Class B Loan Event of Default shall, at the option of Topco, be the date the definitive
agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated with such
_pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma provisions set forth in the definitions of Fixed_
Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio after giving effect
to such Limited Condition Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any
incurrence of Financial Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable
period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition (and not for purposes
of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios
are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in EBITDA of Topco or the
target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited
Condition Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations
solely for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Acquisition is permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets
or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or related transactions;
provided further that if Topco elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement,
any such transactions (including any incurrence of Financial Indebtedness and the use of proceeds therefrom) shall be
deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of
calculating any baskets or ratios under the Class B Loans after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of
such Limited Condition Acquisition.

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

At the request of Topco, in connection with the Incurrence or refinancing by Topco or its Restricted Subsidiaries
of any Financial Indebtedness secured or permitted to be secured on the Collateral, Topco, the relevant Restricted
Subsidiaries and the Borrower Security Trustee shall enter into an intercreditor or similar agreement (an “Additional

283


-----

**Intercreditor Agreement”) with the creditors of such Financial Indebtedness (or their duly authorised representatives) on**
substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or on terms not materially less favourable to the holders of
the Class B Notes), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to the application of the proceeds of the
collateral held thereunder and the means of enforcement; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not
impose any personal obligations on the Borrower Security Trustee or, in the opinion of the Borrower Security Trustee,
adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Borrower Security Trustee under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement. As used herein, the term Intercreditor Agreement shall
include references to any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that supplements or replaces the Intercreditor Agreement.

At the written direction of Topco and without the consent of the holders of the Class B Notes, the Borrower
Security Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to:

(i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement;

(ii) increase the amount or types of Financial Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be
Incurred by Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries that are subject to any such agreement (provided
that such Financial Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement) (including the addition of provisions relating to new Financial Indebtedness ranking
junior or pari passu in right of payment with the Class B Loans and the Class B Notes);

(iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iv) further secure the Class B Loans (including any Additional Class B Loans) in accordance with the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(v) make provision for equal and rateable pledges of the Collateral to secure Class B Additional Notes
and any Additional Class B Loans or to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens;

(vi) grant any Additional Class B Facility or amend any existing Class B Facility to provide for further
advances; and/or

(vii) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of the
Class B Notes in any material respect. Topco shall not otherwise direct the Borrower Security
Trustee to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of holders
of the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Class B
Notes of such sub-class then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted as described in
“— Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and
Topco may only direct the Borrower Security Trustee to enter into any amendment to the extent
such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Borrower Security Trustee or, in
the opinion of the Borrower Security Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Borrower Security Trustee under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement
relating to the Class B Loans, the Class B Notes or any Intercreditor Agreement.

Each holder of the Class B Notes, by accepting a Class B Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted
the terms and conditions of any Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant
to the provisions described herein).

**SHARE ENFORCEMENT EVENT AND CLASS B LOAN EVENT OF DEFAULT**

**Share Enforcement Event**

For so long as any Class A Loans or Additional Class A Loans are outstanding, each of the following is a “Share
**Enforcement Event” under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement:**

(i) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Class B Loan when due
and payable, continued for 30 days;

(ii) if any amount (including, without limitation, any principal amount or premium of a Class B Loan)
remains outstanding (whether or not then due and payable) under a Class B Loan as at close of
business on the Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date of such Class B Loan;

(iii) failure to pay the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Class B Loan upon optional
redemption, upon required repurchase or upon declaration;

284


-----

(iv) failure by Topco and/or Holdco to comply with the provisions described in “— Certain Covenants
— Limitation on Holding Company Activities”;

(v) failure to comply for 30 days after written notice by the Borrower Security Trustee on behalf of the

Class B Notes with Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ obligations described in “— Class B
_Change of Control” (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Class B Notes which will_
constitute a Share Enforcement Event under clause (ii) above);

(vi) failure to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Borrower Security Trustee on behalf of the
holders of the Class B Notes or by the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding
Class B Notes with Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ other agreements contained in the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, subject to the cure rights described in “— Certain Covenants —
_Class B Financial Covenant — Cure right”;_

(vii) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Financial Indebtedness for money borrowed by Topco or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by Topco or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Financial Indebtedness owed to Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary
whether such Financial Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof,
which default:

(A) is caused by a failure to pay principal on such Financial Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Financial Indebtedness
(“Payment Default”); or

(B) results in the acceleration of such Financial Indebtedness prior to its maturity (“Cross**Acceleration”),**

and, in each case, (I) the aggregate principal amount of any such Financial
Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Financial
Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which
has been so accelerated, equals £25.0 million or more and (II) other than a Payment
Default with respect to Financial Indebtedness Incurred under the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or under any Credit Facility;

(viii) Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that taken as a whole constitutes a Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the
meaning of Bankruptcy Law:

(A) commences a voluntary case;

(B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case;

(C) consents to the appointment of a custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its
property; or

(D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;

(ix) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:

(A) is for relief against Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary
or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary in an involuntary case;

(B) appoints a custodian of Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary or for all or substantially all of the property of Topco or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that taken as a whole constitutes a Significant Subsidiary; or

(C) orders the liquidation of Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary,

285


-----

and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days;

(x) failure by Topco or any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as
a whole constitutes a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
£25.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged
liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the
judgment becomes final;

(xi) any security interest under the Borrower Security Documents on any material Collateral shall, at
any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant
Borrower Security Document and the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) for any reason
other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement or the release or amendment of any such security interest in accordance with the terms
of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or such Borrower Security Document or any such
security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or Topco shall assert
in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Class B Loan
Default continues for ten days;

(xii) any Class B Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or Topco or a Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under
its Class B Guarantee in writing, other than in accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of
the Class B Guarantee in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement; and

(xiii) a Class B Note Event of Default (not giving effect, for these purposes, to the provisions of Condition
11.2 of the Class B Conditions) or a Class B Trigger Event has occurred (subject to any relevant
grace period or cure rights).

However, a default under any of the provisions described under clauses (v), (vi), (vii) or (x) above will not
constitute a Share Enforcement Event until the Borrower Security Trustee or the holders of 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Class B Notes notify Topco of the default and, with respect to clauses (v), (vi), (vii) and (x), Topco does not
cure such default (or procures that such default is cured) within the time specified in clauses (v), (vi), (vii) or (x), as
applicable, after receipt of such notice.

In the event of a declaration of enforcement of the Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco Security
Documents because a Share Enforcement Event described in clause (vii) above has occurred and is continuing, the
declaration of enforcement of the Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco Security Documents shall be automatically
annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Share Enforcement Event pursuant to clause (vii) shall
be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Financial Indebtedness, or the Financial Indebtedness that gave rise
to such Share Enforcement Event shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration
with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the declaration of enforcement of the Topco Payment Undertaking and the
Topco Security Documents would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) any
other then existing Share Enforcement Events have been cured or waived.

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will provide that (i) if a Share Enforcement Event occurs for a
failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial
Default is cured, such Share Enforcement Event for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with
the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Share Enforcement Event for the failure to
comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver
any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement shall be deemed
to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even
though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

If a Share Enforcement Event occurs and is continuing, the Borrower Security Trustee acting upon the
instructions of the Issuer Security Trustee as directed by the Class B Note Trustee, who shall be required to act if directed
by the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Class B Notes, may by notice to Topco enforce the
Topco Payment Undertaking and Topco Security Documents in accordance with their terms and the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**Class B Loan Event of Default**

If at any time either (i) no amounts remain outstanding under any Class A Loans or Additional Class A Loans
or (ii) an acceleration of the amounts that remain outstanding under any Class A Loans has occurred, each of the Share
Enforcement Events set out in “— Share Enforcement Event” above will also constitute a “Class B Loan Event of
**Default”.**

286


-----

In addition, whether or not any amounts remain outstanding under any Class A Loans or Additional Class A
Loans, any default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Class B Loan borrowed under the
Class B Issuer/ Borrower Loan Agreement when due on the applicable Class B Loan Final Maturity Date shall be a Class B
Loan Event of Default.

If a Class B Loan Event of Default (other than a Class B Loan Event of Default described in clauses (viii) or
(ix) of the first paragraph of “— Share Enforcement Event”, above) occurs and is continuing, the Borrower Security Trustee
by notice to Topco on the instruction of the Issuer Security Trustee (who acts on the instructions of the Class B Note
Trustee, as directed by the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Class B Notes) in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, may declare the principal or premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Class B Loans to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal,
premium and accrued and unpaid interest, the applicable Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and Additional
Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately.

If a Class B Loan Event of Default described in clauses (viii) or (ix) of the first paragraph of “— Share
_Enforcement Event” above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, the_
applicable Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B Loans will
become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Borrower Security
Trustee or any holders of Class B Notes.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Class B Loans because a Class B Loan Event of Default
described in clause (vii) of the first paragraph of “— Share Enforcement Event” above has occurred and is continuing, the
declaration of acceleration of the Class B Loans shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default
triggering such Class B Loan Event of Default pursuant to clause (vii) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders
of the Financial Indebtedness, or the Financial Indebtedness that gave rise to such Class B Loan Event of Default shall
have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the
annulment of the acceleration of the Class B Loans would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction and (2) all existing Class B Loan Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on
the Class B Loans that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Class B Loans, have been cured or waived.

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured,
such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed
in the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any
other provision of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such
report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the
prescribed period specified in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

No Class B Loan Event of Default may occur with respect to the Class B Loans while any amounts remain
outstanding under any of the Class A Loans (until after an acceleration of the Class A Loans) although this is without
prejudice to the ability of the Borrower Security Trustee, at the direction of the Class B Noteholders, to enforce the security
granted pursuant to the Topco Security Documents in certain circumstances including, without limitation, where there has
been a failure to pay cash interest on the Class B3 Loan prior to the Class B3 Loan Expected Maturity Date, on the Class B4
Loan prior to the Class B4 Loan Expected Maturity Date or on the Class B5 Loan prior to the Class B5 Loan Expected
Maturity Date or a failure to repay principal and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon on such date. Where there is such
a failure to pay and for so long as such Class B Loan remains outstanding thereafter (whether or not security is being
enforced), any overdue amount of principal or interest and such Class B Loan will bear interest at the interest rates set out
in the second and third paragraphs under “— Interest — Payment of interest” above, as applicable.

**AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS**

**Procedure**

Any term of the Class B Finance Documents may be amended or waived with the agreement of the Borrowers
(or CP Opco on their behalf), the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Each Guarantor agrees to (and authorises CP Opco to execute on its behalf) any amendment or waiver allowed
by this covenant which is agreed to by the Borrowers (or CP Opco on their behalf). This includes any amendment or waiver
which would, but for this paragraph, require the consent of each Guarantor if the Class B Guarantee under the Class B
Finance Documents is to remain in full force and effect.

For the purposes of any amendment, waiver, consent, modification or variation in respect of the Class B
Financial Covenant described above under “—Certain Covenants—Class B Financial Covenant”, the Class B5

287


-----

Noteholders shall not be considered part of the relevant Class B Noteholders for the purposes of the Class B Instructing
Group in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**POST-CLOSING REORGANISATIONS**

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement also provides that a number of post-closing transactions will be
permitted (subject to certain conditions being satisfied), including:

**Longleat Headlease Transfer and grant of the New Longleat Opco Lease**

If CP Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that it intends to arrange the transfer either
directly or indirectly by means of a surrender and re-grant of the Longleat Headlease Interest from Longleat Propco to a
new property-holding Obligor (a “Longleat Headlease Transfer”) and the grant of the Opco Lease between that new
Obligor and CP Opco (the “New Longleat Opco Lease”) in each case with the consent of the landlord, then provided that
CP Opco certifies that the provisions relating thereto in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with, the Borrower Security
Trustee must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice but subject to the second paragraph of this
covenant, at the cost of the Borrowers, sign and execute all such documents, instruments and consents (including Land
Registry forms) as are necessary or desirable in order to enable the transfer of the Longleat Headlease Interest and the grant
of the New Longleat Opco Lease as aforesaid.

In connection with the Longleat Headlease Transfer and the New Longleat Opco Lease, such new Obligor must:

(i) execute and deliver in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the Borrower
Secured Creditors a Longleat Legal Charge; and

(ii) provide the Borrower Security Trustee with a legal opinion (in a form satisfactory to the Borrower
Security Trustee) on the enforceability of the Longleat Legal Charge,

in each case, at the same time as any relevant release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee, and
provide, as soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of the Longleat Headlease Transfer, the Borrower Security
Trustee with a new certificate of title in industry standard form evidencing that that new Obligor is entitled to be registered
as the registered proprietor of the Longleat Headlease Interest and CP Opco is entitled to be registered as the registered
proprietor of the New Longleat Opco Lease, and the Borrower Security Trustee is entitled (but not obliged) to be registered
as the proprietor of the Longleat Legal Charge.

In connection with the grant of the New Longleat Opco Lease, CP Opco must execute and deliver in favour of
the Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the Borrower Secured Creditors a charge by way of legal mortgage in
respect of the New Longleat Opco Lease substantially in the form set out in the Borrower Deed of Charge at the same time
as any relevant release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee.

**Release of Designated Obligors**

If:

(i) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the Obligor Group intends to
wind up and ultimately dissolve some or all of the Designated Obligors; and

(ii) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the provisions relating thereto
as set out in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with,

then the Borrower Security Trustee must as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice, at the cost of
the Borrowers:

(A) release:

(I) all Liens granted by the relevant Designated Obligors under the Borrower Security
Documents; and

(II) all Liens granted in respect of any share capital of the relevant Designated Obligors
under the Borrower Security Documents; and

(B) irrevocably release and discharge the relevant Designated Obligors from all liabilities which they
may have under the Class B Finance Documents.

288


-----

The above provisions may be utilised on more than one occasion in connection with different Designated
Obligors.

**Capital reductions**

If CP Opco (on behalf of the Obligors) notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee in writing (and
with reasonable detail as to what is proposed) that an Obligor proposes to undertake any capital reduction procedures then,
subject to (b), (c) and (d) below, the Borrower Security Trustee must sign and/or execute such documents or instruments
and give such consents (if any) as are or may be necessary or desirable in the opinion of CP Opco (acting reasonably) in
order to implement the relevant capital reduction.

Any costs of the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee in respect of any such capital reduction must be met
by the Obligors.

CP Opco must first provide the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee with appropriate evidence (which may
be, if required in writing by the Borrower Security Trustee, an opinion issued by the professional tax advisor of the Group)
satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee (acting reasonably) that the proposed capital reduction will not give rise to
any adverse tax liability in the Obligors or the Issuer, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Tax Deed of
Covenant.

The provisions of this covenant are without prejudice to the provisions of “— _Certain Covenants — Class B_
_Restricted Payments”._

The provisions of this covenant shall not apply on and after the Existing Class B Loans Discharge Date.

**Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisations**

If CP Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that, without prejudice to the Group’s
obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Obligor Group intends to enter into a transaction, or
a series of transactions, in connection with a sale of a Propco or a Propco’s interest in a Holiday Park (such transaction or
series of transactions, a “Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisation”) in each case with landlord consent (where such consent is
required), then the Borrower Security Trustee must as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice, at the
cost of the Borrowers, provide all necessary consents, waivers and permissions (including any release and simultaneous
re-taking of security which may be required) which are necessary to enable such Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisation to take
place, but only to the extent that:

(i) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the provisions relating thereto
as set out in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with; and

(ii) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that any such release is not
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the position of the Borrower Secured
Creditors.

The above provisions may be utilised on more than one occasion in connection with different Permitted PreSale Reorganisations.

**Permitted Post-Closing Reorganisations**

If CP Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that, without prejudice to the Group’s
obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Group intends to enter into a transaction, or a series
of transactions, as part of the reorganisation of the Group as envisaged in Section 14 of the Permitted Post-Closing
Reorganisation Paper (a “Permitted Post-Closing Reorganisation”), then the Borrower Security Trustee must as soon as
reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice, at the cost of the Borrowers, provide all necessary consents, waivers
and permissions (including any release and simultaneous re-taking of security which may be required) which are necessary
to enable the Permitted Post-Closing Reorganisations to take place, but only to the extent that:

(i) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the provisions relating thereto
as set out in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with; and

(ii) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that any such release is not
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the position of the Borrower Secured
Creditors.

The above provisions may be utilised on more than one occasion in connection with different Permitted PostClosing Reorganisations.

289


-----

**Woburn Headlease Transfer and grant of the Woburn Opco Lease**

If CP Woburn Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that it intends to arrange the
assignment of the Woburn Headlease from CP Woburn Opco to a new property-holding Obligor (a “Woburn Headlease
**Transfer”) and/or the grant of an Opco Lease between that new Obligor or CP Woburn Opco, as the case may be, and CP**
Opco (the “Woburn Opco Lease”) in each case with the consent of the landlord, then provided that CP Woburn Opco
certifies that the provisions relating thereto in the First Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with, the
Borrower Security Trustee must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice but subject to the
paragraph below, at the cost of the Borrowers, sign and execute all such documents, instruments and consents (including
Land Registry forms) as are necessary or desirable in order to enable the transfer of the Woburn Headlease and/or the grant
of the Woburn Opco Lease as aforesaid. In connection with the Woburn Headlease Transfer and/or the Woburn Opco
Lease, such new Obligor must:

(i) execute and deliver in favour of the (i) Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the Borrower
Secured Creditors a mortgage over the relevant Property; and

(ii) provide the Borrower Security Trustee with a legal opinion (in a form satisfactory to the Borrower
Security Trustee) on the enforceability of that mortgage,

in each case, at the same time as any relevant release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee, and
provide, as soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of the Woburn Headlease Transfer, the Borrower Security
Trustee with a new certificate of title in industry standard form evidencing that that new Obligor is entitled to be registered
as the registered proprietor of the Woburn Headlease and CP Opco is entitled to be registered as the registered proprietor
of the Woburn Opco Lease, and the Borrower Security Trustee is entitled (but not obliged) to be registered as the proprietor
of the Woburn Legal Charge.

In connection with the grant of the Woburn Opco Lease, CP Opco must execute and deliver in favour of the
Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the Borrower Secured Creditors a charge by way of legal mortgage in respect
of the Woburn Opco Lease substantially in the form set out in the Borrower Deed of Charge at the same time as any relevant
release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee.

**ADDITIONAL SITE COVENANTS**

**Costs and payments**

Notwithstanding anything in “— Certain Covenants — Class B Restricted Payments” to the contrary, any
Obligor may, in connection with any Additional Site, incur Relevant Costs (on behalf of an Additional Site Entity) provided
that:

(i) the Net Exposure Amount does not at any time exceed £1.0 million; and

(ii) the Long Term Net Exposure Amount does not at any time exceed £5.0 million, each such amount
to be indexed, upwards only, at the end of each financial year based on the CPI applicable to that
Financial Year.

For the purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant:

“Long Term Net Exposure Amount” means, at any time:

(i) the aggregate of Relevant Costs (x) which have been incurred and paid by the Obligors under the
first paragraph of this covenant which have been funded otherwise than by utilisation of funds which
at the time they have been paid by the Obligors have been able to be distributed as Class B Restricted
Payments and (y) which have been contracted to be paid but are not yet payable by the Obligors;
less

(ii) the aggregate of amounts reimbursed to the Obligors by the relevant Additional Site Entities.

“Net Exposure Amount” means, at any time:

(i) the aggregate of Relevant Costs incurred and paid by the Obligors under the first paragraph of this
covenant which have been funded otherwise than by utilisation of funds which at the time they have
been paid by the Obligors have been able to be distributed as Class B Restricted Payments; less

(ii) the aggregate of amounts reimbursed to the Obligors by the relevant Additional Site Entities.

290


-----

“Relevant Costs” means costs:

(i) which relate only to services provided to or in respect of an Additional Site; and/or

(ii) which represent the proportion of costs incurred in respect of obligations to third parties which are
attributable to an Additional Site;

and which, in either case, are not costs relating to management, internal accounting (including tax,
but not external, audit), personnel, compliance support, supply arrangements, health & safety, IT
site maintenance services, concessionary arrangements, customer services, legal and information
technology, sales and/or marketing central costs incurred by an Obligor in respect of the Center
Parcs Group generally, a proportion of which may be recharged to the relevant Additional Site
Entity.

**Additional Obligors**

If a person who is not an original party to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, either following its
acquisition by an Obligor or through its incorporation, becomes a Subsidiary of Intermediate Holdco, it shall promptly
execute and deliver to the Borrower Security Trustee an Accession Deed (together with any supporting documentation
referred to in that Accession Deed) and, upon such execution and delivery, such person shall be bound by the provisions
of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement as if the terms set out in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement
were incorporated in full into the arrangements made between that person and the Borrower Secured Creditors.

In the event that the accession of any person to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement requires the
Borrower Security Trustee, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Cash Manager, the Class B Registrar, the Class B Transfer
Agent, the Borrower Account Bank, the Issuer Account Bank or the Principal Paying Agent to comply with “know your
customer” or other similar identification procedures and in such circumstances where the necessary information is not
already available to it, the Obligor Group Agent shall promptly upon the request of the Borrower Security Trustee supply,
or procure the supply of, such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Borrower Security
Trustee in order for it to carry out and be satisfied that it has complied with all the necessary “know your customer” or
similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to any relevant person pursuant to the accession of such
person to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement as an Additional Obligor or Additional Non-Obligor Group Entity
and such person shall not become an Additional Obligor or Additional Non-Obligor Group Entity until the Borrower
Security Trustee has completed its “know your customer” or similar checks.

Each party acknowledges that such Accession Deed shall, if so requested by the Borrower Security Trustee or
the Issuer, be accompanied by: (i) legal tax and accounting opinions, addressed to the Borrower Security Trustee and the
Issuer, and in a form satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee; (ii) any documentation required to accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Borrower Deed of Charge (if relevant); and (iii) a certificate signed by the Borrowers
confirming that no Share Enforcement Event, Class B Loan Default or Class B Loan Event of Default is outstanding.

Such Obligor shall accede to the Original Tax Deed of Covenant in accordance with clause 2.8 of the Original
Tax Deed of Covenant, to the First Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant in accordance with Clause 8 of the First
Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant, to the Second Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant in accordance with Clause 7 of
the Second Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant, to the Third Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant in accordance with
Clause 7 of the Third Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant, to the Fourth Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant in
accordance with Clause 7 of the Fourth Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant and to the Fifth Supplemental Tax Deed of
Covenant in accordance with Clause 7 of the Fifth Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant.

**Resignation of Obligors**

Any Borrower may request that a non-Material Obligor ceases to be an Obligor under the terms of the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement by giving to the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee a duly completed Obligor
Resignation Request.

The Borrower Security Trustee must accept an Obligor Resignation Request (in substantially the same form as
provided in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) and notify the Borrowers and the Issuer of its acceptance if the
conditions referred to in the Obligor Resignation Request are satisfied. The relevant Obligor will cease to be an Obligor
when the Borrower Security Trustee gives the notification.

**CLASS A DISCHARGE DATE**

The Obligors will not permit the Class A Discharge Date to occur unless the Issuer has received a Rating Agency
Confirmation in respect of the Class B Notes from S&P with respect thereto.

291


-----

**CLASS A COVENANTS**

From the date on which a Share Enforcement Event also constitutes a Class B Loan Event of Default, the general
and property covenants set out in the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (the “Class A Covenants”) shall be
deemed to be incorporated into the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement mutatis mutandis as further described below,
until such time as the Issuer receives a Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P in relation to the disapplication of the
Class A Covenants.

Where the Class A Covenants are incorporated into the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement as described
above:

(a) capitalised terms used in the Class A Covenants shall have the same meaning and construction as
incorporated into the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, subject to paragraphs (b) to (e)
below;

(b) references to “Class A Loans”, “Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement”, “Class A IBLA” and
“Class A Notes” shall be deemed to be references to “Class B Loans”, “Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement”, “Class B IBLA” and “Class B Notes”, respectively;

(c) references to a “Class A Loan Event of Default” and “Class A Loan Potential Event of Default”
shall be deemed to be references to a “Class B Loan Event of Default” and a “Class B Loan Default”
respectively;

(d) where a Class A Covenant (or a defined term referred to in a Class A Covenant) refers to both
“Class A” and “Class B”, the references to “Class B” shall be deemed to be deleted and the
references to “Class A” shall be deemed to be references to “Class B”;

(e) the Borrower Security Trustee shall have the power to enforce the Class A Covenants on behalf of
the Issuer and (indirectly) the Class B Noteholders as if the Class B Loan constituted a Class A Loan
on the terms of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement may be amended by the parties thereto in accordance with the
Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement from time to time without the consent of the
Class B Noteholders. To the extent any Class A Covenants are amended following the Sixth Closing Date, the Class A
Covenants incorporated into the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in the manner described above, shall be the
Class A Covenants as amended, restated or supplemented on the date of such incorporation into the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

If the Class A Covenants are amended following the Sixth Closing Date, the CP Opco shall notify the Issuer and
the Class B Note Trustee of such amendments, and the Issuer shall give notice to the Class B Noteholders in the manner
set out in the Class B Conditions.

**RELEASE OF LIENS**

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, liens on the Collateral securing the obligations under the Class B Finance
Documents (or if other Borrower Secured Liabilities remain outstanding, all claims of the Issuer in respect of those Liens
to the extent of its claims under the Class B Finance Documents) will be automatically and unconditionally released:

(a) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on each Class B Loan under the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or discharge thereof;

(b) upon release of a Guarantee in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (with
respect to the Liens securing the assets, property and Capital Stock of the Guarantor that is released
from such Guarantee);

(c) in connection with any disposition of Collateral to any Person other than Topco or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (but excluding any transaction subject to the provisions described under “—
_Certain Covenants — Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” that is permitted by the Class B_
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (with respect to the Liens on such Collateral));

(d) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property
or assets to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) Topco or any
Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition that is not prohibited by, or does not otherwise
violate the provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement relating to asset sales;

292


-----

(e) if Topco designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(f) as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(g) otherwise permitted under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

The Borrower Security Trustee will, subject to its receipt of an Officer’s certificate or opinion of counsel or
other documentation reasonably requested, take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing
the obligations under the Class B Finance Documents in accordance with the provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Borrower
Security Documents. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Borrower Security Trustee without the
consent of the Issuer.

**DEFEASANCE**

The Borrowers may at any time terminate all obligations of the Borrowers and the Guarantors under the Class B
Loans and the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Share Enforcement
Events and Class B Loan Event of Defaults, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust,
the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Borrower Security Trustee and the obligations of the
Borrowers in connection therewith. Subject to the foregoing, if the Borrowers exercise their legal defeasance option, the
Class B Finance Document and the rights of the Borrower Security Trustee and the Class B Noteholders under the
Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust) in so far as
they apply to the Class B Loans, the Class B Notes and the Class B Noteholders.

The Borrowers at any time may terminate their and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described
under “— Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (i) and (ii) of the first paragraph of “— Certain Covenants — Merger,
_Consolidation or Sale of Assets”) and “— Change B Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such_
covenants described under “— Share Enforcement Event And Class B Loan Event Of Default”, the operation of the crossdefault upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Borrowers
and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision
described under “— Share Enforcement Event And Class B Loan Event Of Default — _Share Enforcement Event”_
(“covenant defeasance”).

The Borrowers at their option at any time may exercise their legal defeasance option notwithstanding their prior
exercise of the covenant defeasance option. If the Borrowers exercises their legal defeasance option, payment of the Class B
Loans may not be accelerated because of a Share Enforcement Event or Class B Loan Event of Default with respect to such
Class B Loans and the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event would not give the right to enforce the Topco Payment
Undertakings and Topco Security. If the Borrowers exercise their covenant defeasance option with respect to the Class B
Loans, payment of the Class B Loans may not be accelerated because of a Share Enforcement Event specified in clauses
(vi) (other than with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “— Certain
_Covenants — Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”), (vii), (viii) (with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (x),_
(xi) or (xii) under the first paragraph of “— Share Enforcement Event And Class B Loan Event Of Default — Share
_Enforcement Event”._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Borrowers must irrevocably deposit in trust by way of security
(the “defeasance trust”) with the Borrower Security Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the
Borrower Security Trustee for this purpose) cash in Sterling in an amount sufficient for the payment of principal, premium,
if any, and interest, the applicable Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon on the relevant Class B Loans to maturity and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the
Borrower Security Trustee of:

(1) an opinion of U.S. counsel to the effect that the lenders of the relevant Class B Loans will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such opinion of U.S. counsel must be based on
a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax
law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate of each Borrower stating that the deposit was not made by the Borrowers
with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the
Borrowers;

293


-----

(3) an Officer’s Certificate of each Borrower and an opinion of counsel (which opinion of counsel may
be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent
provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been
complied with;

(4) an opinion of U.S. counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute,
or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended; and

(5) all other documents or other information that the Borrower Security Trustee may reasonably require
in connection with either defeasance option.

**SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE**

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, and the rights of the Borrower Security Trustee, the Issuer and
the Class B Noteholders under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Borrower Security Documents, will be discharged and
cease to be of further effect with respect to all outstanding Class B5 Loans when (1) (i) all of the Class B5 Loans have
become due and payable or (ii) all of the Class B5 Loans will become due and payable at the Class B5 Loan Expected
Maturity Date or the Class B5 Loan Final Maturity Date, in each case within one year or (iii) all of the Class B5 Loans are
to be called for prepayment within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee
for the giving of notice of prepayment by the Borrowers; (2) the Borrowers have deposited or caused to be deposited with
the Borrower Security Trustee (or another entity designated by the Borrower Security Trustee for this purpose), an amount
in Sterling sufficient to pay and discharge the entire outstanding principal amount on the Class B5 Loans, together with
any prepayment premium, if any, accrued and unpaid interest, the Class B5 Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and
any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, to the date of deposit (in the case of Class B5 Loans that have become due and
payable), or to the Class B5 Loan Final Maturity Date, or prepayment date, as the case may be; (3) the Borrowers have
paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement with respect to the
Class B5 Loans; (4) the Borrowers have delivered an irrevocable notice of prepayment to the Borrower Security Trustee
and have delivered irrevocable instructions to apply the funds deposited towards the payment of the Class B5 Loans on the
prepayment date; and (5) the Borrowers have delivered to the Borrower Security Trustee an Officer’s Certificate of each
Borrower (which the Borrower Security Trustee may rely on without further inquiry) to the effect that all conditions
precedent under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Class B5
Loans have been complied with.

**NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of Topco or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Topco, the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Class B
Finance Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Class B
Noteholder by accepting a Class B Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Class B Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**GOVERNING LAW**

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Class B5 Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement will be

Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio is being calculated, but on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio is made (the “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date”), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, redemption, defeasance, retirement
or extinguishment of Financial Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as
if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period; _provided, however, that the pro forma_

Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date, shall be calculated on a pro forma basis (including anticipated synergies and
expenses and cost savings) assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, consolidations and
disposed or discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in EBITDA
resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period. If since the beginning of such period
any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into Topco or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,
consolidation or disposed or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period (including anticipated
synergies and expenses and cost savings) as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation or disposed
operation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period. Any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary
on the Fixed Charge Coverage Calculation Date will be deemed to be a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such fourquarter period. Any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Fixed Charge Coverage Calculation Date will be
deemed not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such four-quarter period.

calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of Topco (including any
anticipated _pro forma synergies and expenses and cost savings). If any Financial Indebtedness bears a floating rate of_
interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Financial Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in
effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into
account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Financial Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalised Lease Obligation
shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of
Topco to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalised Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. For the purposes of
making the computation referred to above, interest on any Financial Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed
with a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Financial Indebtedness during the
applicable period, except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Financial Indebtedness that may
optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered
rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such
optional rate chosen as Topco may designate.

“Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum of:

The Offered Notes sold to persons who are not U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation
S will be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Global Note”). The
Global Note will be deposited on the Sixth Closing Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the account of Euroclear and Clearstream (each, a “Clearing System”).

Ownership of interests in the Global Note (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through such participants.

Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Note on behalf of their respective participants
through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except
under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive certificated form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained
in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain
states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in
definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry
Interests. In addition, while the Offered Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered
the owners or “holders” of Offered Notes for any purpose.

By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Global Note, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to represent,
among other things, that it is not a U.S. person, that it is located outside the United States and that, if it determines to
transfer such beneficial interest prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period (as such terms are defined in
Rules 902 and 903 of Regulation S), deemed to include the 40-day period after the commencement of the offering of the
Offered Notes or the Sixth Closing Date, whichever is later (the “distribution compliance period”), it will transfer such
interest only to a person who is not a U.S. person in an offshore transaction in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of
Regulation S, in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States. See
“Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions”.

So long as the Offered Notes are held in global form, the common depositories for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable (or their respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Note for all
purposes under the Note Trust Deed governing the Offered Notes. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the
participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders
of Offered Notes under the Note Trust Deed.

By acquiring an Offered Note (or any interest therein), each purchaser and transferee is deemed to represent,
warrant and agree, for so long as it holds such Offered Note (or any interest therein), that (a) either (1) it is not, and is not
acting on behalf of, any Plan or (2) its acquisition, holding and disposition of the Offered Note (or any interest therein)
will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code or a violation of any Similar Law, and (b) it will not sell or otherwise transfer the Offered Note (or any interest
therein) to any transferee that is a Plan or any person acting on behalf of any Plan.

None of the Issuer, the Paying Agents, the Class B Registrar, the Class B Transfer Agent or the Class B Note
Trustee will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Note**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by
them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption
of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in
connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). Center Parcs understands that, under the
existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all the Offered Notes are to be redeemed at any time,
Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to
prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry
Interest of £100,000 principal amount or less may be redeemed in part.

-----

**Payments on Global Note**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures. The
Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or
future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as
described under the captions “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes — Taxes — Additional Amounts” in Annex A
hereto. If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under the captions
“Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes — Taxes — Additional Amounts” in Annex A hereto, as applicable, the
Issuer will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the
Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such
holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may
be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices
will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Each payment in respect of any Global Note will be made to the person shown as the holder of a Global Note
at the close of business on the Clearing System Business Day (the “Global Note Record Date”) immediately prior to the
due date for payment where “Clearing System Business Day” means a day on which each Clearing System for which
the Global Note is being held is open for business.

Under the terms of the Note Trust Deed, the Issuer, the Class B Note Trustee, the Class B Registrar, the Class
B Transfer Agent and the relevant Paying Agent, will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (e.g. Euroclear or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other
purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Class B Note Trustee, the Class B Registrar, the Class B Transfer Agent
or any of their respective Paying Agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for (1) any aspect of the records of
Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a BookEntry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, (2) Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant or (3) the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Note**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Note
will be paid to the holders of interests in such Offered Notes in pounds sterling.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of Offered Notes (including the presentation of Offered Notes for exchange as described herein) only at the
direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests are credited and only in respect of such
portion of the aggregate principal amount of Offered Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given
such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the
taking of any other action in respect of the Global Note. However, if there is an event of default under the Note Trust
Deed, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right, at the request of the holders of the Offered Notes, to
exchange the Global Note for definitive registered notes in certificated form (“Definitive Notes”) and to distribute
Definitive Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive
Notes for any reason, including to sell Offered Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require physical delivery of
securities or to pledge such Offered Notes, such holder must transfer its interests in the Global Note in accordance with
the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set out in the Note Trust
Deed.

Each Global Note will have a legend to the effect set out under “Notice to Investors and Transfer
_Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification_
requirements discussed under “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions.” Transfers of Book-Entry Interests will at
all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

329


-----

Any Book-Entry Interest in a Global Note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned
Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to
all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as
long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Notes**

Under the terms of the Note Trust Deed, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Notes if:

         - the Issuer has been notified that Euroclear or Clearstream have been closed for business for a continuous
period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, whether statutory or otherwise) or have announced
an intention permanently to cease business or have in fact done so and, in any such case, no successor
clearing system satisfactory to the Class B Note Trustee is available; or

         - the Issuer has or will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would not be suffered were the
Offered Note represented by the Global Note in definitive form.

In such an event, the Class B Registrar will issue Definitive Notes, registered in the name or names and issued
in denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear,
Clearstream or the Issuer (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received
from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Notes will bear the
restrictive legend as provided in the Note Trust Deed, unless that legend is not required by such Note Trust Deed or
applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Class B Note Trustee, the Class B Transfer Agent, any Paying
Agent and the Class B Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner
thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be
evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of
evidencing title to the Offered Notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Offered Notes; however, owners of the
Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. Center Parcs provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience
of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may
be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners, the Paying Agents,
the Class B Transfer Agent or the Class B Registrar is responsible for those operations or procedures.

Center Parcs understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream
hold securities for participating organisations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions
between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear
and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance,
settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic
securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream
is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian
relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who, in turn, act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such
interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that
certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial
interests to such persons may be limited.

-----

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Offered Notes represented by the Global Note are expected to be listed and admitted for trading on the
Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Note between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream
will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers
of interests in the Global Note among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at
any time. None of the Issuer, the Obligors, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners, the Class B Note
Trustee or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their
respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing
their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Offered Notes will be made in pounds sterling. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional notes in registered
form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on
the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in sameday funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any
Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be
made on the desired value date.

331


-----

**TAXATION**

_If you are a prospective investor, you should consult your tax advisor on the possible tax consequences of_
_buying, holding or selling the Offered Notes under the laws of your country of citizenship, residence or domicile,_
_including the effect of any local taxes applicable to you. The discussions that follow do not purport to be a_
_comprehensive description of all tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or sell the_
_Offered Notes. In particular, these discussions do not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to_
_you. The discussions that follow for each jurisdiction are based upon the applicable laws and interpretations thereof as_
_in effect as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. These tax laws and interpretations are subject to change, possibly_
_with retroactive or retrospective effect._

**United Kingdom Taxation**

The following applies only to persons who are the beneficial owners of the Offered Notes and is a summary of
the Issuer’s understanding of current United Kingdom law and HMRC published practice in the United Kingdom relating
only to United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments of interest on the Offered Notes. The following is not
exhaustive and does not deal with any other United Kingdom taxation implications of acquiring, holding or disposing of
the Offered Notes. The United Kingdom tax treatment of prospective Noteholders depends on their individual
circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. Prospective Noteholders who may be subject to tax in a
jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom or who may be unsure as to their tax position should seek their own
professional advice.

**_Payment of Interest on the Offered Notes_**

Payments of interest on the Offered Notes may be made without deduction of or withholding on account of
United Kingdom income tax provided that the Offered Notes are and continue to be listed on a “recognised stock exchange”
within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The International Stock Exchange is a recognised stock
exchange. The Offered Notes will satisfy this requirement if they are officially listed in Guernsey in accordance with
provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in EEA states and are admitted to trading on the International Stock
Exchange. Provided, therefore, that the Offered Notes are and remain so listed, interest on the Offered Notes will be payable
without withholding or deduction on account of United Kingdom tax.

In other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Offered Notes that have
a UK source on account of United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), subject to any available
exemptions and reliefs. However, where an applicable double tax treaty provides for a lower rate of withholding tax (or
for no tax to be withheld) in relation to a Noteholder, HMRC can issue a notice to the Issuer to pay interest to the Noteholder
without deduction of tax (or for the interest to be paid with tax deducted at the rate provided for in the relevant double tax
treaty).

The references to “interest” in this United Kingdom Taxation section means “interest” as that term is
understood for United Kingdom tax purposes, and in particular any premium element of the redemption amount of any
Notes redeemable at a premium may constitute a payment of interest subject to the withholding tax provisions discussed
above. In certain cases, the same could be true for amounts of discount where Notes are issued at a discount. The
statements above do not take any account of any different definitions of “interest” or “principal” which may prevail
under any other law or which may be created by the terms and conditions of the Notes or any related documentation.

**Certain Jersey taxation considerations**

The following summary of the anticipated treatment of the Issuer and holders of the Offered Notes (other than
residents of Jersey) is based on Jersey taxation law and practice as they are understood to apply at the date of this
document and is subject to changes in such taxation law and practice. It does not constitute legal or tax advice and does
not address all aspects of Jersey tax law and practice. Prospective investors in the Offered Notes should consult their
professional advisers on the implications of acquiring, buying, selling or otherwise disposing of the Offered Notes under
the laws of any jurisdiction in which they may be liable to taxation.

**_Taxation of the Issuer_**

The Issuer is not regarded as resident for tax purposes in Jersey. Therefore, the Issuer will not be liable to
Jersey income tax other than on Jersey source income (except where such income is exempted from income tax pursuant
to the Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961, as amended) and payments in respect of the Offered Notes may be paid by the
Issuer without withholding or deduction for or on account of Jersey income tax. The holders of the Offered Notes (other
than residents of Jersey) will not be subject to any tax in Jersey in respect of the holding, sale or other disposition of such
Offered Notes.

332


-----

**_Stamp Duty_**

In Jersey, no stamp duty is levied on the issue or transfer of the Offered Notes except that stamp duty is
payable on Jersey grants of probate and letters of administration, which will generally be required to transfer the Offered
Notes on the death of a holder of such Offered Notes where such Offered Notes are situated in Jersey. In the case of a
grant of probate or letters of administration, stamp duty is levied according to the size of the estate (wherever situated in
respect of a holder of Offered Notes domiciled in Jersey, or situated in Jersey in respect of a holder of Offered Notes
domiciled outside Jersey) and is payable on a sliding scale at a rate of up to 0.75% of such estate and such duty is capped
at £100,000. Where the Offered Notes are in registered form and the register is not maintained in Jersey such Offered
Notes should not be considered to be situated in Jersey for these purposes.

Jersey does not otherwise levy taxes upon capital, inheritances, capital gains or gifts nor are there other estate
duties.

**The proposed financial transaction tax**

On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a
Directive for a common financial transaction tax (“FTT”) in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy,
Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (each, other than Estonia, a “participating Member State”). However, Estonia
has since stated that it will not participate.

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the
Offered Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Primary market transactions referred
to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 are expected to be exempt.

Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and
outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Offered Notes where at
least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial
institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances,
including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial
instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States. It may
therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States
may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of the Offered Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the
FTT.

333


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of Offered Notes
by (i) “employee benefit plans” that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended (“ERISA”), (ii) “plans” (including individual retirement accounts) as defined in and subject to Section
4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”), (iii) entities whose underlying assets
include the assets of any such employee benefit plan subject to ERISA or other plan subject to Section 4975 of the
Code, and (iv) governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section
3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA)) that, while not subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may be subject to other federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations that are
substantially similar to the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Law”) (each of
(i)-(iv), a “Plan”). This summary is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of
these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is
particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Offered Notes on behalf of, or with
the assets of, any Plan, consult with their own counsel to determine whether such acquisition will violate Title I of
ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or any Similar Law.

**General Fiduciary Considerations**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan
and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary
authority or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of an
ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, to an ERISA Plan, is
generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

When considering an investment in the Offered Notes with the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine
whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Law relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without
limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the
Code and any Similar Law.

**Prohibited Transaction Considerations**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of Section
3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or
administrative exemption or exception is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who
engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under
ERISA and the Code.

The acquisition or holding of the Offered Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, Center
Parcs or any of their respective affiliates are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or
result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless
the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory or administrative exemption or
exception. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor (the “DOL”) has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions
(“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Offered Notes. These exemptions include, without
limitation, PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to
transactions effected by an “independent qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments
by an insurance company general account), PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager)
and PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts). In addition, Section 408(b)(17)
of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code could provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section
406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and non-fiduciary service
providers to the ERISA Plan; _provided that_ neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or
indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the
assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no more than
adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that any of the PTCEs or any other
exemption or exception will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Offered Notes, or that,
if any of the PTCEs or another exemption or exception is available, it will cover all aspects of any particular transaction.
Prospective investors should consult with their advisors regarding the prohibited transaction rules and these exemptions.

334


-----

Because of the foregoing, the Offered Notes should not be acquired, held or disposed of by any Plan or any
person acting on behalf of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and disposition would not constitute or result in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any Similar
Law.

**Plan Asset Considerations**

Regulations promulgated under ERISA by the DOL at 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section
3(42) of ERISA (together, the “Plan Asset Regulations”), provide that when an ERISA Plan acquires an “equity interest”
in an entity that is neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment company registered under
the Investment Company Act, the ERISA Plan’s assets include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each
of the underlying assets of the entity unless it is established either that equity participation in the entity by “benefit plan
investors” is not “significant” or that the entity is an “operating company,” in each case as defined in the Plan Asset
Regulations. For purposes of the Plan Asset Regulations, equity participation in an entity by benefit plan investors will
not be significant if benefit plan investors hold, in the aggregate, less than 25% of the total value of each class of equity
interests of such entity, excluding equity interests held by any person (other than a “benefit plan investor”) who has
discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the entity or who provides investment advice for a fee
(direct or indirect) with respect to such assets, and any “affiliates” (as defined in the Plan Asset Regulations) of such
person. For purposes of this 25% test, “benefit plan investors” include ERISA Plans and any entity whose underlying
assets include, or are deemed for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code to include, “plan assets” by
reason of an ERISA Plan’s investment in the entity under the Plan Asset Regulations, but exclude governmental, church
and non-U.S. plans.

While the discussion under “Taxation” assumes the Offered Notes will be treated as debt for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, such characterisation is not entirely clear, and no assurances can be given that the IRS would not
assert, or that a court would not uphold, a different characterisation of the Offered Notes. In addition, it is anticipated
that (i) the Offered Notes will not constitute “publicly offered securities” for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulations
and (ii) the Issuer will not be an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act.

If the Issuer’s assets were deemed to be “plan assets” of an ERISA Plan holding the Offered Notes, this would
result in, among other things, (i) the application of the prudence and other fiduciary responsibility standards of ERISA
to investments made by the Issuer, and (ii) the possibility that certain transactions that the Issuer might enter into, or may
have entered into, in the ordinary course of business might constitute or result in non-exempt prohibited
transactions under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code and might have to be rescinded.

Because of the foregoing, the Offered Notes may not be purchased by, transferred to or otherwise held by any
Plan or any person acting on behalf of any Plan, unless the acquisition, holding and disposition of the Offered Notes
would not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code or a violation of any Similar Law. Any purported purchase, transfer or holding in violation of these limitations
will be void. If such purchase or transfer is not treated as being void for any reason, the Offered Notes will automatically
be transferred to a charitable trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and the Plan will acquire no right in the
Offered Notes.

**Representations**

Accordingly, each purchaser and holder of the Offered Notes (or any interest therein) will be deemed to have
represented, warranted and agreed, for so long as it holds such Offered Notes (or any interest therein), that (A) either (i)
it is not, and is not acting on behalf of, any Plan, or (ii) its acquisition, holding and disposition of the Offered Notes (or
any interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any Similar Law, and (B) it will not sell or otherwise transfer the Offered
Notes (or any interest therein) to any transferee that is a Plan or any person acting on behalf of any Plan.

Any purported purchase, transfer, holding or disposition in violation of these representations will be void. If
such purchase, transfer, holding or disposition is not treated as being void for any reason, the Offered Notes will
automatically be transferred to a charitable trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and the purported holder will
acquire no right in the Offered Notes.

**LIMITATION ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the security interests in_
_each of the jurisdictions in which collateral is being provided. It is a summary only and does not purport to be complete_
_or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity or enforceability of the Offered Notes or_
_guarantees in respect of the Offered Notes. The laws of more than one jurisdiction could potentially apply in respect of_
_certain matters which could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your_
_ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Offered Notes and the security interests on the_
_collateral. Prospective investors in the Offered Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to all such_
_limitations and considerations._

**Jersey Insolvency**

The Issuer and one of the Obligors is incorporated under the laws of Jersey. In the event of an insolvency of
the Issuer or the Jersey Obligor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There are two principal regimes for
corporate insolvency in Jersey: désastre and winding up (including just and equitable winding up and creditors’ winding
up). The principal type of insolvency procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the application for an Act of the
Royal Court of Jersey under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”)
declaring the property of a debtor to be “en désastre” (a “declaration”). On a declaration of désastre, title and possession
of the property of the debtor vest automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the “Viscount”). With
effect from the date of declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may
not commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover
the debt.

Additionally, the shareholders of a Jersey company (but not its creditors) can instigate a winding up of an
insolvent company, which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of the Companies
(Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Jersey Companies Law”). On a creditors’ winding up, a liquidator is nominated,
usually by the shareholders. The creditors may approve such a liquidator or apply to appoint a different liquidator. The
liquidator will stand in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding up, gather assets, make appropriate disposals
of assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate. After the commencement of the winding up, no action can be
taken or continued against the company except with the leave of court. The shareholders must however give creditors 14
days’ notice of the meeting to commence the creditors’ winding up. The corporate state and capacity of the company
continues until the end of the winding up procedure, when the company is dissolved. The Jersey Companies Law requires
a creditor of a company (subject to appeal) to be bound by an arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors
immediately before or in the course of its winding up if, inter alia, three quarters in number and value of the creditors
acceded to the arrangement.

**_Transactions at an Undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court may,
on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”) or
liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up, a procedure which is instigated by shareholders not creditors), set aside
a transaction (including any guarantee or security interest) entered into by a company with any person (the “other party”)
at an undervalue. There is a five-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration
of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The
Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that
define what constitutes a transaction at an undervalue, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into
such a transaction with a person connected with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Preference_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law, the court
may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”) or
liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a preference (including any guarantee or security interest)

336


-----

given by the company to any person (the “other party”). There is a 12-month look-back period from the date of
commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination
pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed
provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a preference, the operation of the relevant
time and the effect of entering into a preference with a person connected with the company or with an associate of the
company.

**_Extortionate Credit Transactions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court
may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”) or
liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction providing credit to the debtor company which is
or was extortionate. There is a three-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or
declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule. The Jersey
Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define
what constitutes a transaction which is extortionate.

**_Disclaimer of Onerous Property_**

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the date of the
declaration of désastre and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may within six months
following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous property of the company. “Onerous
property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract lease or other immoveable property if it is situated
outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it might give rise to a liability to pay money or
perform any other onerous act, and includes an unprofitable contract.

A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the “rights, interests and liabilities of the
company/debtor in or in respect of the property disclaimed” and discharges the company/Viscount from all liability in
respect of the property as of the date of the commencement of the creditors’ winding up/from the date of the declaration
but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company/debtor from liability, affect the rights
or liabilities of any other person. A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of a disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor
of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and shall have standing as a creditor in the désastre or creditors’
winding up. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without
limitation) in relation to the power to disclaim onerous property.

**_Fraudulent Dispositions_**

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey customary
law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention of defeating creditors’ claims
may be set aside.

**_Security Over Non Jersey Situs Assets_**

Under the laws of Jersey, a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey is deemed to have capacity to
grant security governed by foreign law over property situated outside Jersey, but to the extent that any floating charge or
other security interest governed by a foreign law is expressed to apply to any asset, property and undertaking of a person
incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey such floating charge or other security interest is not likely to be held valid
and enforceable by the Courts of Jersey in respect of Jersey situs assets.

**_Administrators, Receivers and Statutory and Non-statutory Requests for Assistance_**

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the
Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators are not part of
the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Courts of Jersey may not recognise the powers of an administrator, administrative
receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets (although see below in the case of fixed charge
receivers).

However, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Jersey court may assist the courts of
prescribed countries and territories and, applying general principles of comity, assist the courts in other jurisdictions, in
all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Jersey court thinks fit. These prescribed
jurisdictions include the United Kingdom. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL
model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey.

337


-----

If the request comes from a non-prescribed country, then common law and principles of comity will be
considered by the Royal Court by virtue of its inherent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in
another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend
on the nature of the requesting country’s insolvency regime.

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should not be assumed that the
UNCITRAL provisions will automatically be followed. That is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. It would
also be wrong to assume for European countries that the position will be in accordance with EU Insolvency Regulation.
Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the purposes of implementation of its directions. Accordingly,
the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and the automatic test of centre of main
interests does not apply as a result.

**_Enforcement of Security and Security in Insolvency_**

Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
liquidation, dissolution, re-organisation or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the rights of creditors,
and laws in relation to transactions at undervalue, preference, extortionate credit transactions, disclaimer of onerous
property and fraudulent dispositions also apply in Jersey. Insolvency or bankruptcy alone will not render such security
interest invalid or non-binding on the parties thereto or any liquidator of a Jersey company or the Viscount in a désastre
of a Jersey company’s property. This is subject to certain statutory exceptions, which include (but are not limited to):

        - Article 159(4) of the Jersey Companies Law provides that after the commencement of a creditors’
winding up of a Jersey company no action shall be taken or proceeded with against the company except
by leave of the court and subject to such terms as that court may impose; and

        - Article 10(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law provides that with effect from the date of a declaration of
_désastre against a person (the “bankrupt”), a creditor shall not have any other remedy against the_
property or person of the bankrupt or commence or (except with the consent of the Viscount or by order
of the court) continue any action or legal proceedings to recover such creditor’s debt; and

         - Generally a transfer of shares in a Jersey company, not being a transfer made to or with the sanction of
the liquidator of the company in a creditors’ winding up (insolvent winding up) under the Jersey
Companies Law, or the Viscount after the property of the company is declared to be en désastre under
the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, and an alteration in the status of the company’s members made after the
commencement of the creditors’ winding up or after such declaration of en désastre, is void.

In the enforcement of foreign security in Jersey, the Courts of Jersey — properly applying the relevant
provisions of foreign law — are likely to uphold (subject to the comments above) a claim that the relevant security
interest (and other than in respect of any property or assets situated or deemed to be situated in Jersey) is binding on a
Jersey company and any liquidator or other similar person having control of the assets of a Jersey company.

**Cayman Islands Insolvency**

The Topco Obligors are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Accordingly, any insolvency
proceedings with respect to the Topco Obligors are likely to be pursuant to the Companies Law and the Companies
Winding Up Rules, 2018 of the Cayman Islands. Under Cayman Islands law, insolvency proceedings involve the
appointment of a liquidator whose function it is to act as the agent of the company in order to: (i) realise the company’s
unsecured assets; (ii) identify the company’s unsecured creditors and the amounts of their claims; and (iii) distribute the
proceeds of realisation of the company’s unsecured assets (net of expenses and claims of preferred creditors) to the
company’s unsecured creditors pro rata and, after the creditors have been paid in full, to distribute the remaining balance
(if any) to the company’s shareholders. Cayman Islands legislation provides for three different procedural systems for
winding up companies, namely: (i) compulsory winding up by order of the Court; (ii) voluntary winding up initiated by,
for example, a resolution of the shareholders or in accordance with the provisions of the company’s articles of
association; and (iii) voluntary winding up originally initiated by, for example, a resolution of the shareholders that is
subsequently made subject to the supervision of the Court. A winding up petition may be presented to the Court by the
company itself or a creditor (including a contingent or prospective creditor) or a shareholder of the company. A winding
up order is usually sought on the basis that the company is unable to pay its debts, or because it is otherwise just and
equitable to make a winding up order. When considering the inability of the company to pay debts, Cayman Islands law
requires that the Court have regard to the company’s cash-flow position. When a winding up order is made by the Court,
an automatic moratorium on proceedings against the company is imposed and proceedings may not be commenced or
continued against the company except with the express permission of the Court. Following the making of a winding up
order, dispositions of property, transfers of shares and alterations in the status of shareholders made after the presentation
of the petition for winding up are void unless approved by the Court. The moratorium does not affect any valid

338


-----

contractual rights of set-off or subordination agreements acquired or entered into before the commencement of the
liquidation. A secured creditor is entitled to enforce his security without the leave of the Court and without reference to
the liquidator.

It is a fundamental rule of Cayman Islands insolvency law that all ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated
creditors are treated equally irrespective of the nature of their claims. This is referred to as the pari passu rule. Local
creditors (save in certain cases for a minimal category of statutorily preferred creditors, including statutory fees and very
limited amounts owed to Cayman Islands employees) do not have any preference or priority over foreign creditors. This
rule applies in relation to ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated creditors existing as at the date of the presentation of
the winding-up petition, or whose claims arise out of causes of action that accrued before the date of the presentation of
the winding-up petition. These will include creditors whose claims against the company arise out of contract, common
law and statutory torts, equitable claims, etc. Generally speaking, a creditor having a validly created security interest over
property of a company in liquidation is entitled to enforce his security without reference to the official liquidators and
without the leave of the Court.

As set out in greater detail below, preferred creditors under Cayman Islands law will rank ahead of unsecured
creditors of a company. Preferred creditors under the Companies Law will rank ahead of unsecured creditors and secured
creditors where the secured creditors’ security is in the nature of a floating charge. Furthermore, all costs, charges and
expenses properly incurred in the voluntary winding up of a company, including the remuneration of the liquidators, are
payable out of the assets of the company in priority to all other unsecured claims.

Enforcement against a Cayman Islands company may be limited by Section 86 of the Companies Law which
provides that a compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors or any class of them shall, if sanctioned
by the Court, be binding on all the creditors or any class of creditors. If there are creditors who form a class, the class will
be bound by the scheme if a majority in number representing 75% in value of the creditors or class of creditors who
attended and voted (whether in person or by proxy), approved the scheme. Cayman Islands authority suggests that a class
is constituted by “those persons whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together
with a view to their acting in their common interest.” Two or more creditors are likely to constitute separate classes in a
compromise or arrangement if they hold security over different assets or hold security over the same asset but do not rank
equally (see "Scheme of Arrangement" below).

Enforcement may be limited by Section 99 of the Companies Law which provides that, when a winding up
order has been made, any disposition of the company’s property and any transfer of shares or alteration in the status of
the company’s members made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless the Court otherwise orders, void.

Section 97 of the Companies Law provides:

(i) “when a winding up order is made or a provisional liquidator is appointed no suit, action or other
proceedings, including criminal proceedings, shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company
except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court may impose; and

(ii) when a winding up order has been made, any attachment, distress or execution put in force against the
estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the winding up is void.”

However, Section 142(1) of the Companies Law confirms that, notwithstanding that a winding up order has been
made, a creditor who has security over the whole or part of the assets of a company is entitled to enforce his security
without the leave of the Court and without reference to the liquidator.

It should also be noted that Section 96 of the Companies Law provides that a court in the Cayman Islands may
upon an application from the company or any creditor of contributory at any time after the presentation of the petition for
the winding up of a company and before the making of a winding up order, where any action or proceedings are pending
in a summary court, the Court, the Court of Appeal, the Privy Council or in a foreign court, restrain such proceedings
accordingly “on such terms as [the court] thinks fit.” In practice, the scope and effect of the stay under Section 96 is the
same as Section 97.

A liquidator may at any time give notice to a creditor whose debt is secured that he proposes, at the expiration of
28 days from the date of the notice, to redeem the security at the value put upon it in the creditor’s proof.

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

Under Cayman Islands law there is no formal debtor-in-possession form of rehabilitation for companies in
financial distress. However, it is possible for an insolvent company to enter into a scheme of arrangement to try and
restructure its debts. Section 86 of the Companies Law provides for the approval of schemes of arrangement,
compromise and reconstruction agreed between a company and its members or a company and its creditors. The

339


-----

application can be made by the company, a creditor or, if the company is in liquidation, by the liquidator. There is no
statutory obligation on a company or its directors to propose a scheme of arrangement.

Before the Court considers whether or not to sanction a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on
the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending
on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are
given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by, among others, the company or its creditors. If a majority
in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of
creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approved thresholds contained in the
finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the Court) be binding on all affected creditors,
including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The
scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the Court at a sanction hearing where the Court will review the fairness of the
scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The Court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved,
make an order conditional upon modifications being made to the scheme or reject the scheme.

**_Priority of claims on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of liquidation under Cayman Islands law is to realise the assets of the insolvent
company and to distribute the cash realisations made from those assets to its creditors. Under Cayman Islands insolvency
law, creditors are placed into different classes and the proceeds from the realisation of the insolvent company’s property
is applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. Distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors
until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise,
distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each
creditor within a class.

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

(a) First, in satisfaction of the rights of fixed charge creditors (although such assets are, strictly speaking, outside of
the liquidation) (Section 140(2) of the Companies Law);

(b) Secondly, in satisfaction of the claims of preferred creditors (to the extent that there are insufficient assets to make
payment of all preferential debts) (Section 140(2) of the Companies Law);

(c) Thirdly, in satisfaction of the claims of floating charge creditors (Section 140(2), Section 141(1) of the Companies
Law);

(d) Fourthly, in satisfaction of the provable debts of the unsecured creditors of the company (but having regard to
priority where a creditor is subordinated to other creditors) (Section 140(1) of the Companies Law);

(e) Fifthly, in paying statutory interest on the proved debts (Section 149(2) of the Companies Law); and

(f) Sixthly, distribution of surplus assets to shareholders in accordance with their rights and interests.

There are circumstances under Cayman Islands law in which the granting by a Cayman Islands company of
security can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company becomes insolvent or is placed into
liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) following the granting of the security.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under Cayman Islands law in respects of Cayman
Islands law governed security interests:

**_Voidable preferences_**

Pursuant to Section 145(1) of the Companies Law, a transaction will constitute a voidable preference in the
following circumstances:

(i) a conveyance or transfer of property (or charge thereon) or payment obligation was made,
incurred, taken or suffered by the relevant company in favour of a creditor within 6 months
immediately preceding the commencement of liquidation of the company;

(ii) at the time when the conveyance or transfer of property or payment obligation was made,
incurred, taken or suffered, the company was insolvent (that is, unable to pay its debts); and

(iii) the conveyance or transfer of property or payment obligation was made, incurred, taken or
suffered with a view to giving the creditor a preference over other creditors. Please note that if the

340


-----

creditor is a “related party” (that is, an entity who has the ability to control the relevant company
or exercise significant influence over the relevant company in making financial and operating
decisions), the transfer of property or payment obligation will be deemed to have been made with
a view to giving such a creditor a preference.

If the above criteria can be satisfied with respect to the transfer of property or payment obligation, the
transaction will be invalid and a liquidator would be able to claw back the property or payment transferred.

**_Fraudulent dispositions_**

Under the Fraudulent Dispositions Law (1996 Revision) (the “Fraudulent Dispositions Law”) (in respect of
creditor actions) and pursuant to Section 146 of the Companies Law (in respect of liquidator actions), a transaction will
constitute a disposition at an undervalue in the following circumstances:

(i) a disposition (being any type of transfer, conveyance, assignment, lease, mortgage, pledge or other
transaction by which any legal or equitable interest in property is created, transferred or
extinguished) of property is made;

(ii) the disposition was made by the relevant company at an undervalue (which means for no
consideration or for consideration the value of which in money or monies worth is significantly
less than the value of the property the subject of the disposition); and

(iii) the disposition was made with an intent to defraud its creditors (that is, an intention to wilfully
defeat an obligation or liability (which includes a contingent liability) owed to a creditor which
existed on or prior to the date of the disposition).

If the above criteria can be satisfied with respect to the disposition of property, the disposition shall be
voidable at the instance of the liquidator (under Section 146 of the Companies Law) and/or by the creditor thereby
prejudiced (under the Fraudulent Dispositions Law). No action or proceeding can be commenced by a liquidator or
creditor seeking to establish that a disposition of property constituted a disposition made at an undervalue more than 6
years after the date of disposition. The burden of establishing the intent to defraud lies with the official liquidator and/or
the creditor (as applicable).

**_Fraudulent trading_**

Pursuant to Section 147 of the Companies Law, if in the course of winding up of the company it appears that
any business of the company has been carried on with an intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any
other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the liquidator may apply to the Court to make such orders as it thinks fit to
restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of
the victims of the transaction. It is notable that this form of order does not involve the imposition of liability for the
company’s debts as such, but enables the Court to form a judgment as to the extent to which it is appropriate to require
each participant in a company’s fraudulent trading to contribute personally to the assets, so as to augment the funds
available for distribution to unpaid creditors/members (as applicable). Section 147 of the Companies Law uses the term
“persons” which enables liability to be imposed upon a wider circle of participants in any such activity than merely
directors and officers. It should be noted further that Section 147 of the Companies Law imposes no restrictions in terms
of the period of time prior to the company’s winding up during which the events must have taken place in order for
liability to be imposed.

An application seeking this type of relief is brought by a liquidator for the benefit of the company’s estate as a
whole and not merely for the benefit of individual creditors (in an insolvent liquidation) or individual members (in a
solvent liquidation).

**_Constructive trusts_**

A liquidator may cause the company to commence a proceeding against the directors of the company for
breach of fiduciary duty where, for example, the company (by its directors) knowingly divests itself of an asset at an
undervalue in breach of the directors’ duty to act in the best interests of the company. If the recipient of the asset knew
he/she/it was receiving it as a result of a breach of fiduciary duty, the Court may determine that the asset should be
impressed with a constructive trust such that the recipient will be deemed to be holding the asset on trust for the
company.

**_Equitable nature of mortgage over shares_**

The mortgage created by Topco over the shares of CP Cayman Limited to secure the obligations of Topco
under the Topco Payment Undertaking is governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands and comprises an equitable not a

341


-----

legal mortgage. An equitable mortgage has certain disadvantages compared with a legal mortgage, including the fact that
an earlier security will have priority and a subsequent third party purchaser for value or legal mortgagee of the shares
mortgaged, who does not have notice of the equitable mortgage, will not be subject to it. The Court will not recognise or
enforce foreclosure (meaning the assumption by the mortgagee of beneficial ownership of the mortgaged property and
the extinction of the mortgagor’s equity of redemption therein) against the shares mortgaged pursuant to the mortgage
over the shares in CP Cayman Limited in the absence of foreclosure proceedings against Topco in the Court, or a
judgment in respect of foreclosure proceedings against Topco in the courts of another jurisdiction which the Court is
prepared to enforce in accordance with the usual principles applicable to the enforcement of foreign judgments in the
Cayman Islands.

**_Registration of security_**

The Cayman Islands does not have a central public filing system for registration of mortgages and charges
granted by Cayman Islands companies or relating to assets held by a Cayman Islands company (save for ships, planes
and intellectual property and land registered in the Cayman Islands and some other asset classes which would not appear
relevant to the current transaction). Where a security interest is created by a company (regardless of where the asset is
located), it is necessary under the Companies Law to enter any security interest granted by the company in the register of
mortgages and charges of the company (maintained by the company at its registered office in the Cayman Islands) (the
"ROMC"), although failure to make such a registration is a technical breach of the Companies Law and from a Cayman
perspective such failure would not adversely impact the validity or priority of such a security interest. Accordingly, it is
possible for the Company to have created prior ranking valid security interests over the same assets which is not
identifiable from a review of the ROMC. Other than entering particulars of any agreements entered into by a company
creating security interests in its ROMC, it is not necessary that any transaction documents creating a security interest be
filed, recorded or enrolled with any governmental, regulatory or judicial authority in the Cayman Islands in order to
ensure the validity of the security interest.

Under the Companies Law, a person who has agreed to become a member of a Cayman Islands company and
whose name is entered on the Register of Members is deemed to be a member of that Cayman Islands company.
Accordingly, a failure to effect such an entry in the Register of Members may restrict the ability of the mortgagee to
enforce its rights over the shares in a Cayman Islands company in respect of the legal title thereto or realise its security
by selling the legal title of such shares to third parties. If the Cayman Islands company or its registered office provider
refuses to enter the mortgagee or its nominee in the Register of Members following enforcement of such security over
shares in a Cayman Islands company, it may be necessary to obtain a court order to compel such action. In addition,
section 99 of the Companies Law provides that when a winding up order has been made, any disposition of a Cayman
Islands company's property and any transfer of shares or alteration in the status of a Cayman Islands company's members
made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless the Court otherwise orders, void. Further, section 125 of the
Companies Law provides that any transfer of shares, not being a transfer of shares with the sanction of the liquidator, and
any alteration in the status of a Cayman Islands company's members made after the commencement of a voluntary
winding up is void. Depending on the circumstances, such provisions could affect the ability of the mortgagee to enforce
the security created over the shares in the Cayman Islands company.

It does not necessarily follow that, as a matter of Cayman Islands conflict of laws rules, priorities of competing
interests in the shares in a Cayman Islands company will be determined according to Cayman Islands domestic rules as
the jurisdiction of incorporation of a Cayman Islands company. In certain circumstances the issue of priority may be
determined according to the laws of the jurisdiction where the Register of Members of a Cayman Islands company is
situated, the laws of the jurisdiction where the relevant share certificates are situated or the laws of a contract governing
the deposit or custody of the shares in a Cayman Islands company.

**_Security over shares_**

As noted above, the security granted by Topco over the shares of CP Cayman Limited is an equitable share
mortgage, pursuant to which Topco as mortgagor will remain the registered holder of the mortgaged shares in CP
Cayman Limited's Register of Members until enforcement following an event of default. On the occurrence of an event
of default whilst the mortgagee or its nominee will have the right to be entered as the holder of the mortgaged shares on
the internal Register of Members, it would hold the shares as 'mortgagee in possession' subject to the 'equity of
redemption' (detailed above). As mortgagee in possession the mortgagee cannot be regarded as the absolute owner of the
shares and would need to sell the shares to satisfy the debt returning the excess proceeds from the sale of the shares to the
mortgagor.

**_Fixed security and recharacterisation risk_**

It is the essence of a fixed charge that the person creating the charge does not have liberty to deal with the assets
which are the subject matter of the security in the sense of disposing of such assets or expending or appropriating the

342


-----

moneys or claims constituting such assets and accordingly, if and to the extent that such liberty is given to Topco, any
charge constituted pursuant to the Topco Share Security Agreement entered into by Topco may operate as a floating,
rather than a fixed, charge. Depending upon the level of control actually exercised by the chargor, there is therefore a
possibility that the security granted thereunder would be regarded under the Cayman Islands law as a floating charge.
Floating charges have certain weaknesses, including the following:

(i) they have weak priority against purchasers and chargees (who are not on notice of any negative
pledge contained in the floating charge) of the assets concerned and against lien holders, execution
creditors and creditors with rights of set off;

(ii) the claims of a floating charge holder may be subject to prior claims of preferred creditors under
Cayman Islands law (explained in further detail below); and

(iii) they rank after fixed charges.

**_Preferred creditors_**

Under Cayman Islands law, upon the liquidation of a Cayman Islands company such as Topco, when applying
the proceeds of assets realised in the course of a winding up subject to a debenture or floating charge created by the
company, the claims of a limited category of preferred creditors will take priority over the claims of creditors holding the
relevant security. On a winding up of Topco in the Cayman Islands, the following debts are preferential debts:

(i) any sum due by Topco to an employee, whether employed in the Cayman Islands or elsewhere, in
respect of salaries, wages and gratuities accrued during the four months immediately preceding the
liquidation;

(ii) any sum due and payable by Topco on behalf of an employee in respect of medical health
insurance or pension fund contributions;

(iii) any sum due in respect of severance pay and earned vacation leave where the employee’s contract
has been terminated as a result of the winding up;

(iv) any compensation payable to a workman in respect of injuries incurred at work pursuant to the
Workmen’s Compensation Law (1996 Revision); and

(v) certain taxes due to the Cayman Islands Government comprising sums payable under the Customs
and Border Control Law, 2018, the Companies Law, the Stamp Duty Law (2019 Revision) and the
Tourist Accommodation (Taxation) Law (2013 Revision), and any licence fees payable under
regulatory laws.

**_Payment of dividends under Cayman Islands law_**

Under Cayman Islands law, dividends may only be declared by a Cayman Islands company out of funds
legally available for distribution so long as the company has the ability to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary
course of business.

**European Union**

Certain of the Guarantors of the Offered Notes are incorporated under the laws of a Member State of the
European Union.

Pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 20 May 2015
(the Recast EUIR), which replaced the Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 (EUIR) on insolvency
proceedings, “main” insolvency proceedings in respect of a debtor should be opened in the member state in which its
centre of main interests (“COMI”) is located. The forms of insolvency proceedings which can comprise main
proceedings are listed in Annex A to the Recast EUIR and include, in respect of the UK, administration, compulsory
liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation with confirmation by the court (see further “Administration” and
“Liquidation” below). Under the Recast EUIR, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company’s COMI is in the place
where its registered office is located. This rebuttable presumption only applied if the registered office has not been
moved to another member state within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of main insolvency
proceedings. The EUIR remains applicable to insolvency proceedings opened before the Recast EUIR came into effect.

It is possible to rebut the presumption that a company’s COMI is in the place of its registered office if factors
which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties (meaning that they are already in the public domain and what
a typical third party would learn as a result of dealing with the company, without making specific enquiries) indicate that
the company’s COMI is elsewhere (Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ECJ C-341/2004). Factors which may be taken into account

343


-----

include the location of any regulatory authorities and the places where the company’s business is managed and operated,
board meetings held and the accounts prepared and audited.

The Recast EUIR specifically states in the Recitals (Recital 30) that the presumption of the COMI being at the
place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in a member state
other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors
establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and
supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other member state. In this regard, special
consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a company conducts the administration of its
interests. In the event of a shift in the COMI, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the
company is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g. by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial
correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means).

Where the bodies responsible for the management and supervision of a company are in the same place as its
registered office, and where the management decisions of the company are taken from there, the presumption cannot be
rebutted (Interedil Srl (in liquidation) v Fallimento Interedil Srl and another C-396/09). The point at which a company’s
COMI falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened – although note that under
the Recast EUIR there is the three month look back period as regards the presumption of the company’s COMI.

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the Recast EUIR are to be recognised in other
Member States, although secondary proceedings may additionally be opened in any Member State where the company
has an “establishment”. An establishment is a place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the
3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human
means and goods. This means a fixed place of business and dealings with third parties (as opposed to purely internal
administration). The effect of secondary proceedings is limited to the assets located in that Member State. The forms of
insolvency proceedings which can comprise secondary proceedings are listed in Annex B to the Recast EUIR.

The Recast EUIR contains provisions dealing with the co-ordination of main and secondary proceedings. The
Recast EUIR further contains provisions dealing with insolvency proceedings of members of a group of companies.

**England and Wales**

Certain of the Guarantors of the Offered Notes are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.
Therefore, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the such Guarantors would likely be commenced in England
and conducted in accordance with the requirements of English insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the Recast EUIR,
where an English company conducts business in another member state of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the
English courts may be limited if the company’s COMI is found to be in another Member State. There are a number of
factors that are taken into account to ascertain COMI. The COMI should correspond to the place where the company
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The place of
the registered office of the company is presumed to be the COMI in the absence of proof to the contrary. The point at
which a company’s COMI falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened –
although note that under the Recast EUIR there is the three month look back period as regards the presumption of the
company’s COMI. See “European Union” for further details.

**The Insolvency Test**

The Insolvency Act 1986 has no test for or definition of insolvency per se but instead relies on the concept of a
company’s ‘inability to pay its debts’ as the keystone for many of its provisions. Pursuant to section 123 of the
Insolvency Act 1986, the circumstances in which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts include, among others, the
following: (i) if a creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served a statutory
demand on the company requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has failed for three weeks to pay,
secure or compound the sum; (ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts
as they fall due; or (iii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the
amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.

**Liquidation/Winding-Up**

Liquidation is a terminal insolvency process pursuant to which the assets of a company are realised by the
liquidator and the proceeds distributed to creditors in accordance with a statutory order of priority (see ‘Statutory order of
priorities’ below), with any surplus paid to the shareholders. Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company
will be dissolved and removed from the register of companies.

There are two different types of liquidation: (i) compulsory; and (ii) voluntary, which is in turn divided into
members’ voluntary liquidation (MVL) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (CVL).

344


-----

Regardless of how a liquidator is appointed, a liquidator owes his or her duties to the company and its
creditors as a whole and has wide powers to do whatever necessary for the conduct of the liquidation. This includes the
power to: (i) agree, compromise and pay creditor claims; (ii) sell any of the company’s property; (iii) bring or defend any
legal proceedings on behalf of the company; (iv) disclaim onerous property or contracts in accordance with section 178
of the Insolvency Act 1986; (v) bring actions against the directors or former directors; and (vi) bring actions to set aside
certain transactions.

In a compulsory liquidation, there is an automatic stay on proceedings being commenced or continued against
the company or its property except with the permission of the court. In a voluntary liquidation, there is no such automatic
stay although the court may, upon the application of the liquidator or any creditor, or contributory of the company, order
a stay under its general discretionary power in section 112 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

_Compulsory liquidation_

Compulsory liquidation is a court-based procedure pursuant to which a creditor or one of the other parties set out in
section 124 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (including the company itself or the directors of the company collectively)
petitions for the winding up of a company and the court makes a winding up order. The grounds which entitle the court to
make a winding up order are set out in section 122 of the Insolvency Act 1986. The most common grounds are that: (i)
the company is unable to pay its debts (see “The Insolvency Test” above for the meaning of this term); and (ii) it is just
and equitable for the company to be wound up.

Pursuant to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, no petition for the winding up of a registered
company may be presented under section 124 of the Insolvency Act 1986 on or after 27 April 2020 on the basis of a
statutory demand served between 1 March 2020 and 30 September 2020 (the Relevant Period).

A creditor may not present a petition under section 124 during the Relevant Period for the winding up of a
registered company on a ground specified in section 123(1)(a) to (d) of the Insolvency Act 1986 unless the creditor has
reasonable grounds for believing that (i) coronavirus has not had a financial effect on the company, or (ii) the facts by
reference to which the relevant ground applies would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had a financial effect on the
company. A creditor may also not present a petition under section 124 during the Relevant Period for the winding up of a
registered company on a ground specified in section 123(1)(e) or (2) of the Insolvency Act 1986 unless the creditor has
reasonable grounds for believing that (i) coronavirus has not had a financial effect on the company; or (ii) the relevant
ground would apply even if coronavirus had not had a financial effect on the company.

Under section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986, any disposition of the company’s property, any transfer of the company’s
shares and any altering of the status of company members is void if made following the ‘commencement of a winding
up’ unless the court orders otherwise. Subject to certain exceptions, if a winding up order is made, it is deemed to have
commenced on the date on which the winding up petition was presented. This gives section 127 retrospective effect,
meaning that any of the specified transactions carried out after the presentation of a winding up petition will be void if a
winding up order is subsequently made unless the company (or an interested party) has first obtained a validation order
from the court.

_Members’ voluntary liquidation_

A MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders pass a special
resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court.

Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the majority of the directors must swear a
statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after making full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they have formed the
opinion that it will be able to pay its debts in full, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the
liquidation.

_Creditors’ voluntary liquidation_

A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders passing a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and has
no court involvement. In contrast to a MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration of solvency for a
CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent) and, after the shareholders’ meeting, the creditors’ must also
resolve to place the company into liquidation. If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator from the
shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail unless any director, member or creditor of the company successfully applies
to the court for an order otherwise.

**_Administration_**

The relevant English insolvency statute empowers English courts, upon receiving an application, to make an
administration order in respect of an English company in certain circumstances (the ‘in-court route’). An administrator

345


-----

can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (the ‘out-ofcourt route’). The in-court route is commenced by an application to court by the company itself, a majority of its
directors, one or more of its creditors including contingent or prospective creditors, the Financial Conduct Authority or
the Prudential Regulation Authority or certain other designated persons. The out-of-court method of appointment is
available only to the directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying floating charge (QFC) (see further below
for the meaning of this term). No physical court hearing is required and the administrator’s appointment takes effect
when the court stamps receipt of the relevant forms.

A QFC is defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 as being a floating charge created by an
instrument which: (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it; and/or (ii) purports to empower the holder of the
floating charge to appoint an administrative receiver and/or an administrator of the company. A person is the holder of a
QFC if that person holds one or more debentures of the company secured by charges and other forms of security which
together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at least one of which is a qualifying
floating charge.

When any person other than a holder of a QFC makes an administration appointment (whether by the in-court or out-ofcourt route), it will be necessary to show that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts (see ‘The
Insolvency test’ above). Regardless of how an administrator is appointed, the administrator will need to consent to act as
administrator and to state that, in his or her opinion, one of the following statutory objectives can be satisfied (the second
objective can only be considered if the first objective is not reasonably practicable and similarly for the third objective):
(i) to rescue the company as a going concern; (ii) to achieve a better result for creditors as a whole than would be likely if
the company were wound up without first being in administration; or (iii) to realise property to make a distribution to one
or more secured or preferential creditors (see ‘Statutory order of priorities’ below).

An interim moratorium takes effect when an application to appoint an administrator is made or a notice of intention to
appoint an administrator is filed at court. This becomes final once the company is in administration. The moratorium
means, among other things, that no other legal process or proceedings may be commenced or continued against the
company and no step can be taken to enforce security over the company’s property (in each case except with the consent
of the administrator or the permission of the court), no administrative receiver can be appointed, no resolution can be
passed for the winding-up of the company and, except in certain limited circumstances, no order be made for the
winding-up of the company.

Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realise their security over that company’s property
notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the administration moratorium in
relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” (generally, cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or
tradable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2)
Regulations 2003 (Financial Collateral Regulations). Note that the Financial Collateral Regulations are secondary
legislation implementing EU Directive 2002/47/EC. During the administration of a company, a creditor would not be
able to enforce any security interest (other than security financial collateral arrangements) without the consent of the
administrator or the permission of the court.

An administrator owes his or her duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. Upon appointment, an administrator
takes control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control of all property to which the
administrator thinks the company is entitled. He or she has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets, except
in respect of assets which are subject to fixed charge security. The permission of the court is required to dispose of any
such fixed charge assets, such permission will only be granted if disposing of the property in question is likely to
promote the administration’s purpose and the proceeds of sale are paid to the fixed charge holder. An administrator’s
powers further extend to investigating why the company failed and, where appropriate, bringing actions against the
directors or former directors or seeking to set aside certain transactions.

An administration does not itself terminate any contracts and, unlike a liquidator, an administrator does not have the
power to disclaim or terminate contracts (although he or she can choose to breach a contract if he or she considers it to be
in the best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an unsecured debt – see
‘Statutory order of priorities’ below).

**_Administrative Receivership_**

Section 72A(1) of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides that the holder of a QFC in respect of a company’s property may not
appoint an administrative receiver of the company subject to certain exemptions set out in sections 72B to 72GA.

Pursuant to section 72B of the Insolvency Act 1986, the first exception to this general prohibition is in the context of
capital markets. There are three limbs that have to be satisfied in order to qualify for this exception: (i) the appointment is
in pursuance of an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement; (ii) a party incurs, or when the

346


-----

agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £50 million under the arrangement; and (iii) the
arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment.

Each of the above three limbs is considered further below.

Pursuant to paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A to the Insolvency Act 1986, an arrangement is a capital market arrangement if:
(i) it involves a grant of security to (A) a person holding it as trustee for a person who holds a capital market investment
issued by a party to the arrangement; or (B) a party to the arrangement who issues a capital market investment; or (C) a
person who holds the security as trustee for a party to the arrangement in connection with the issue of a capital market
investment; or (D) a person who holds the security as trustee for a party to the arrangement who agrees to provide finance
to another party; or (ii) at least one party guarantees the performance of obligations of another party; or (iii) at least one
party provides security in respect of the performance of the obligations of another party; or (iv) it involves an investment
of a kind described in articles 83 to 85 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001
(SI 2001/544), which relates to options, futures and contract for differences (the Regulated Activities Order).

Paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 2A to the Insolvency Act 1986 states that a party to an arrangement includes a party to an
agreement which forms part of the arrangement, provides for the raising of finance as part of the arrangement, or is
necessary for the purposes of implementing the arrangement. Center Parcs notes that there is no statutory definition or
case law on the meaning of the term “arrangement”, however it is clear that an arrangement can be more than just one
agreement and in Center Parcs’ view the term is apposite to describe a series of inter-related transactions.

Pursuant to paragraph 5 of Schedule 2A to the Insolvency Act 1986, the requirement to incur debt of at least £50 million
may be incurred at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement and may be expressed wholly or partly in
foreign currency (in which case the sterling equivalent shall be calculated as at the time when the arrangement is entered
into).

Pursuant to paragraph 2 of Schedule 2A to the Insolvency Act 1986, an investment is a capital market investment if it: (i)
is within article 77 or 77A of the Regulated Activities Order; and (ii) is rated, listed or traded or designed to be rated,
listed or traded.

To place a company into administrative receivership, the holder of a QFC must execute a document appointing an
administrative receiver in accordance with the terms of the security document pursuant to which the QFC was created.
This appointment document must then be delivered to the proposed administrative receiver and the appointment takes
effect upon receipt (provided that the administrative receiver formally accepts the appointment by the end of the next
business day). There is no statutory moratorium that takes effect in relation to or as a result of the appointment of an
administrative receiver.

The principal duty of an administrative receiver is to realise the assets of the company in order to repay the principal and
interest secured by the document pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed. An administrative receiver
generally has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets which derive from both the security document
pursuant to which he or she was appointed and Schedule 1 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (except insofar as this is
inconsistent with the terms of that security document). In exercising such powers, an administrative receiver acts as agent
of the company, unless and until it goes into liquidation. However, an administrative receiver can only dispose of assets
which are subject to prior ranking security with the permission of the court if the court is satisfied that the disposal (with
or without other property) would be likely to promote a more advantageous realisation of the company’s property than
would otherwise be effected and on the condition that the proceeds of sale and any difference between those and the open
market value are paid to the holder of that security. Further, unlike an administrator, an administrative receiver’s powers
do not extend to bringing actions against the directors or former directors or (except in very limited circumstances)
seeking to set aside certain transactions.

Assets coming into the hands of the administrative receiver are applied in payment of Secured Debt, less any costs of
realisation, the preferential debts and the prescribed part (as to the meaning of which see ‘Statutory order of priorities’
below).

**_Schemes of arrangement_**

Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction the compromise of a
company’s liabilities where such company (i) is liable to be wound-up under the Insolvency Act 1986; and (ii) has
“sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this
test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England,
the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in
accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular
facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second
limb are satisfied in the present case.

347


-----

An English court will continue to have jurisdiction during the Brexit implementation period, which ends on 31 December
2020. Recognition of an English scheme in an EU member state will, in part, be dependent on the relevant countries’
private internal law rules. Where a contract is English law governed, Regulation (EC) 593/2008 on the Law Applicable to
Contractual Obligations (the Rome I) continues to apply following the UK’s exit from the EU. While not historically
relied on, it is considered possible that UK schemes would be recognised in EU Member States under Rome I. This may
increase the risk of competing EU processes – leaving some non-UK companies’ applications to English courts to
sanction schemes more open to challenge in their relevant state of incorporation.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and reasonableness of
the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on a detailed debt compromise in respect of their claims in a
single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed
scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the
company or its creditors. If 75% or more by value and over 50% in number of those creditors present and voting at the
creditor meeting(s) vote in favour of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds
contained in the finance documents, that compromise will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected
creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of arrangement and those
who voted against the scheme of arrangement. In certain circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can also result in the
release of guarantees in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise.

**_Restructuring Plan_**

Pursuant to Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a compromise or
arrangement (a “Restructuring Plan”) proposed between a company and its creditors (or any class of them) or its
members (or any class of them) in circumstances where the company has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial
difficulties that affect, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern. The purpose of the
Restructuring Plan is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of these financial difficulties. Similar to a
scheme of arrangement, a sufficient connection to England and Wales is required.

For a consensual plan (ie one where each class votes in favour) to be capable of being sanctioned by the court, the
Restructuring Plan must be approved by 75% by value of creditors or shareholders in each class (there is no majority by
number test as is the case with a scheme of arrangement). The applicant may also apply to the court to exclude a class
from voting if they have no genuine economic interest in the company. Unlike a scheme, if not all classes have approved
the Restructuring Plan as required for a consensual plan, dissenting classes may be crammed down provided that: (i) no
members of the dissenting class would be worse off under the Restructuring Plan than they would be in the most likely
alternative scenario (in the court’s view) if the Restructuring Plan is not sanctioned (the ‘relevant alternative’); and (ii)
the Restructuring Plan is agreed by 75% by value of a class of creditors or (as the case may be) shareholders who would
receive a payment, or has a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative. Even if the
voting threshold is met, the court may nevertheless refuse to sanction the Restructuring Plan if it is not ‘just and
equitable’. If the Restructuring Plan is sanctioned, it will be binding on all affected parties, including those who did not
participate in the vote on the Restructuring Plan and those who voted against the Restructuring Plan.

**_Company voluntary arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act 1986, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator as applicable)
may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise,
or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite
majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the
proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except
with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of
the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected
creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement. However, a secured
creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary
arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security.

**_Supplier contracts_**

One of the common challenges involved in using a formal process to rescue and restructure a company is that it can
trigger termination or other consequences under supply contracts. This makes the company vulnerable to ransom
creditors

_Essential suppliers_

348


-----

The essential supplier regime under sections 233 and 233A of the Insolvency Act 1986 prevents the suppliers from: (i)
making it a condition of the giving of the supply, or do anything which has the effect of making it a condition of the
giving of the supply, that any outstanding charges in in respect of a supply given to the company before the effective date
are paid; and (ii) compelling continued supply by restricting the effect of existing insolvency-related terms in an essential
supply contract.

Essential supplies include such things as water, gas, electricity, communications services, wi-fi and chip-and-pin devices.

_Other suppliers_

Section 233B of the Insolvency Act 1986 says that, if a company enters a qualifying form of insolvency process
(including the moratorium, restructuring plan, CVA, administration and liquidation), suppliers are unable to (i) terminate
or do any other thing (for example, change payment or supply terms) as a result of the commencement of the insolvency
process, or pre-commencement events; or (ii) impose ransoms by demanding payment of outstanding amounts in respect
of pre-moratorium supply as a condition of continuing supply.

The prohibitions apply to both new and pre-existing contracts and last for the duration of the process, which in some
cases could be measured in years. The prohibitions will continue to apply if the company enters into a second insolvency
process. The providers of financial products and services (including lenders), suppliers under the current essential supply
regime (see above) and certain types of entities (such as banks or insurance companies) are excluded from this regime.

Suppliers may still terminate contracts or exercise other contractual rights (which would otherwise be restricted by the
provisions) if: (i) they receive consent from the company or officeholder; or (ii) the court is satisfied that the continuation
of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. Supplier rights relating to events arising after the insolvency process
begins are not affected.

**_Statutory order of priorities_**

A liquidator or administrator will need to comply with the following statutory order of priority when he or she distributes
the proceeds of realised assets to a company’s creditors: (i) proceeds of realisations from assets subject to a fixed charge
are paid to the fixed charge holder (less any costs of realisation); (ii) moratorium debts and certain “priority premoratorium debts” in circumstances where a company has entered into a restructuring moratorium and subsequently
entered into administration or liquidation within 12 weeks from the end of the moratorium (iii) expenses of the
liquidation or the administration, which includes monies arising under a contract entered into by the administrator or
liquidator, or any necessary disbursements made in the ordinary insolvency process; (iv) ordinary preferential debts,
which include (but are not limited to) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes, employment claims (up to
a certain statutory maximum) and bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) up to the statutory limit; (v) secondary preferential debts, being bank and
building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that the claims exceed the statutory
limit, and deposits made through a non-EEA branch of a credit institution that would otherwise have been eligible for
FSCS compensation; (vi) the prescribed part, which is a ring fenced amount of money that the administrator or liquidator
must set aside from realisations from floating charge assets to distribute to unsecured creditors – calculated as 50% of the
first £10,000 of net realisations and 20% of the net realisations thereafter, up to a maximum of £800,000; (vii) proceeds
of floating charge asset realisations (less any costs of realisation, the preferential debts and the prescribed part); (viii)
provable debts of unsecured creditors (these rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in
place between any of them) and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including
accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings; (ix)
statutory interest that arises on debts after the insolvency at either the higher of the contractual and the official rate; and
(x) non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and which are therefore
only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid.

Any surplus will be paid to the shareholders in accordance with the company’s articles of association. There are no
equitable subordination provisions under English law, meaning that an unsecured shareholder loan ranks as a provable
debt alongside other unsecured creditors and will not be subordinated by law.

**_Fixed and floating charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security:
(a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash, or use
cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate
the charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a
fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the
charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s or administrator’s remuneration) properly
incurred in a winding up or administration are payable out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the

subject of the floating charge) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallises, a
company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business,
meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good title to
the assets free of the floating charge and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority
to the floating charge security; (e) in comparison to fixed charge security, floating charge security is subject to certain
additional challenges under English insolvency law; and (f) floating charge security is subject to the claims of
preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions and salaries owed to employees) and to ringfencing. This summary does not set out an exhaustive statement of consequences of the distinction between fixed and
floating security interests.

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterise fixed security interests purported to
be created by a security document as floating charges; the description given to security interests by the parties is not
determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating
security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the
relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is
exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets or their proceeds in the
course of its business without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallisation, the court is likely to hold that the
security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in
the security documents.

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be required to
ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security (after making full provision for
preferential creditors and expenses (floating charge realisations)) for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current
law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realisations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with
a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 where the first ranking floating charge was created on or after 6 April 2020
(£600,000 if created before then).

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into administration
or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) following the granting of the guarantee or
security.

The following potential grounds for challenge set out in the Insolvency Act 1986 may apply to guarantees and
security interests.

**_Transaction at an Undervalue (section 238)_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court
for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee, if such liquidator or administrator believes that
the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. Section 118 of the Small
Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (the “SBEEA”) introduced section 246ZD to the Insolvency Act 1986
from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of action in respect of any
transaction under section 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Where a foreign officeholder has been granted recognition
under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations, he or she also has standing to bring a claim for a transaction at an
undervalue.

There will only be a transaction at an undervalue, if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the
transaction, the English company was or became unable to pay its debts as a result of such transaction within the
meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986. The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into
liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the English company grants the
security interest or the guarantee. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the
company makes a gift to a person, if the receives no consideration of if the company receives consideration of
significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company.

However, a court generally will not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in
good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for
believing that the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an
undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the
transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the
company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act
1986, as amended), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the
solvency of the company in such proceedings.

350


-----

**_Preference (section 239)_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an order
to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of
such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. Section 118 of the SBEEA introduced section 246ZD to
the Insolvency Act 1986 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of
action in respect of any preference under section 239 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Where a foreign officeholder has been
granted recognition under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations he or she also has standing to bring a preference
claim.

There will only be a preference if, at the time the transaction was entered into, the company was or became
unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 as a consequence of its entry into
the transaction. The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings
within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years
(if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the company takes the decision to grant the security interest or the
guarantee ending with the onset of insolvency. A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a
creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities) in a better position
(in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise
have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a
preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not
been given, which could, in this case, include reducing payments under the Offered Notes (although there is protection
for a third-party who enters into one of the transactions in good faith and without notice). However, for the court to do
so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the company was influenced by a desire to produce the
preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was
insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless
the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was
influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings
that there was no such influence.

The desire to prefer requires a “positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the company’s
insolvent liquidation” (Re Fairway Magazines Ltd [1993] BCLC 643). A preferential effect for a creditor may be
foreseen by the company without being desired. Where a company is influenced by “proper commercial considerations”
there will be no desire to prefer and therefore no voidable preference (Re MC Bacon [1990] BCLC 324).

**_Transaction Defrauding Creditors (section 423)_**

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made
for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company,
or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the
transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. The fact that the transaction was not
entered into with a dishonest motive is no defence to the claim. It will suffice that the company’s subjective purpose was
to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the
sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice.

An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by an administrator, a
liquidator the supervisor of a voluntary arrangement in certain circumstances and, subject to certain conditions, the
Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any
person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the permission of the court in the case
of a company in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. A foreign
officeholder recognised under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations also has standing to apply to court.

There is no time limit in the English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made and the
relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction (subject to the normal statutory limitation
periods). If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such
orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to
protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any
obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an
order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor in good faith, for
value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the
transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person
was a party to the transaction.

**_Avoidance of Floating Charge (section 245)_**

Under English insolvency law, if a company is unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the
Insolvency Act 1986 at the time of (or as a result of) granting a floating charge, and the floating charge was granted
within the specified period referred to below, then such floating charge can be avoided except to the extent of the
aggregate of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of
(and the amount of such interest payable in respect of the money paid, services supplied in reduction/discharge in debt),
the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge. This means that a floating charge
can be partly invalid to the extent that it is provided for past consideration. No court action is required save for where
there is a foreign officeholder recognised under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations who wishes to attack the
floating charge under article 23 of the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations.

The requirement for the company to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge
does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the floating charge is granted to a connected
person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below, then the floating charge is
invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any
discharge or reduction of any debt of (and the amount of such interest payable in respect of the money paid, services
supplied in reduction/discharge in debt), the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating
charge, whether the relevant company is solvent or insolvent.

The granting of the floating charge can be challenged only if the relevant company enters into liquidation or
administration proceedings within a period of 12 months (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the
beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the relevant company grants the floating charge. However, if the floating
charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2)
Regulations 2003, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph.

**_Extortionate credit transactions (section 244)_**

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit transaction, the
court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, an assignee of such officeholder or a foreign officeholder
recognised under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations set the transaction aside. Section 118 of the SBEEA
introduced section 246ZD to the Insolvency Act 1986 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators
may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any extortionate credit
transaction claim under section 244 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either: (i)
its terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect
of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing.

The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up to
three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation (which is slightly
different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and preferences).

**_Orders_**

In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e. not section 245), the court has
very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before the
transaction was entered into.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer, the Obligors and the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners entered into a
subscription agreement with respect to the Offered Notes dated       2020 (the “Subscription Agreement”). Pursuant
to the Subscription Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein, each Class B Global
Coordinator and Joint Bookrunner has agreed, severally and not jointly, to subscribe and pay for the aggregate principal
amounts of the Offered Notes as set out opposite its name below.

**Principal amount of the**

**Offered Notes**
Barclays Bank PLC ............................................................................................................
HSBC Bank plc ..................................................................................................................

**Total ................................................................................................................................... £** **250,000,000**

The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners are entitled to fees and reimbursement of certain
expenses pursuant to the Subscription Agreement.

The Offered Notes will initially be offered at the price set forth herein.

The Subscription Agreement provides that the several obligations of the Class B Global Coordinators and
Joint Bookrunners to pay for and accept delivery of the Offered Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the
delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel. The Subscription Agreement also provides that the Issuer and the
Obligors upon accession to the Subscription Agreement will indemnify the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint
Bookrunners against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners may be required to make in respect thereof.

Persons who purchase the Offered Notes from the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners may be
required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase
in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

Delivery of the Offered Notes is expected to be made against payment on the respective Offered Notes on
September 2020, which is the     business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange
Act) following the date of pricing of the Offered Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+   ” (U.S.)).
Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business
days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.

The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners may engage in over-allotment, stabilising
transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Joint Bookrunner.
Stabilising transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilising bids do not exceed a
specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Offered Notes in the open market after the
distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a
selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Offered Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased
in a stabilising or covering transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the offering of the Offered Notes, the Stabilising Manager, or a person acting on its behalf,
may engage in transactions that stabilise, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Offered Notes. Specifically, the
Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilise the
price of the Offered Notes. The Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over-allot the offering of
the Offered Notes, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Offered Notes in the open market to
cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and
purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids.
These activities may stabilise or maintain the respective market price of the Offered Notes above market levels that may
otherwise prevail. The Stabilising Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at
any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Offered Notes.

**Selling Restrictions**

**_United States_**

The Offered Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or
sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except in certain transactions exempt
from or not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

Each Class B Global Coordinator and Joint Bookrunner has agreed, severally and not jointly, that, except as
permitted by the Subscription Agreement, it will not offer or sell the Offered Notes (a) as part of its distribution at any
time or (b) otherwise until completion of the distribution compliance period, within the United States to, or for the
account or benefit of, U.S. persons, and it will have sent to each dealer to which it sells Offered Notes during the
distribution compliance period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the
Offered Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph
have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.

The Offered Notes are being offered and sold outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering of the Offered Notes, an offer or sale of
Offered Notes within the United States by a dealer that is participating in the offering may violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act.

The Issuer, the Obligors and the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners reserve the right to reject
any offer to purchase the Offered Notes, in whole or in part, for any reason. This Offering Memorandum does not
constitute an offer to any person in the United States or to any U.S. person. Distribution of this Offering Memorandum to
any person, other than to a non-U.S. person outside the United States and those persons, if any, retained to advise such
non-U.S. person outside the United States with respect thereto, is unauthorised, and any disclosure without the prior
written consent of the Issuer, as applicable, of any of its contents to any person, except to a non-U.S. person outside the
United States and to those persons, if any, retained to advise such non-U.S. person outside the United States, is
prohibited.

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

Each Class B Global Coordinator and Joint Bookrunner has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold
or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Offered Notes to any retail investor
in the EEA. For the purposes of this provision:

(a) the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended,
“MiFID II”); or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the “Insurance
**Mediation Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as**
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.

**_General_**

Each Class B Global Coordinator and Joint Bookrunner has undertaken that it will not, directly or indirectly,
offer or sell any Offered Notes or have in its possession, distribute or publish any offering circular, prospectus, form of
application, advertisement or other document or information in any country or jurisdiction except under circumstances
that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations and all
offers and sales of the Offered Notes by it will be made on the same terms.

**Other relationships**

The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates may have performed
and continue to perform various financial advisory, investment banking and commercial banking services for, and may
arrange loans and other non-public market financing for, and enter into derivative transactions with, Center Parcs and/or
their affiliates (including its shareholders, the Issuer and the other Obligors) and for which they may receive customary
fees and expenses. The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates may provide
such services in the future. Entities affiliated with each of Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC UK Bank Plc or any of their
respective affiliates are agents and other lenders under the Liquidity Facility Agreement. Additionally, in the ordinary
course of their business, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates may make
or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and

354


-----

financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates (including the
Notes). The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners or their respective affiliates that have a lending
relationship with the Issuer routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk
management policies. Typically, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates
would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or
the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely
affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective
affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of
such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short
positions in such securities and instruments.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN JUDGMENTS**

The Issuer is a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Jersey. The assets of the Issuer
are located outside of the United States. In addition, none of the directors or officers and other executives of the Issuer is
a resident or citizen of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process
within the United States upon the Issuer, or such persons, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. federal or state
courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws or otherwise despite the fact
that, pursuant to the terms of the Note Trust Deed, the Issuer has appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service of
process in New York.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. federal or state court against the Issuer, investors will need to enforce such
judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. federal or state
court judgments outside the United States is described below for the jurisdictions in which the Issuer and its assets are
located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed for advice on enforcing a
judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**Jersey**

The Issuer is incorporated in Jersey. The United States and Jersey currently do not have a treaty providing for
the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial
matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on
civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognised
or enforceable in Jersey. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Jersey, proceedings must first be initiated before a
court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an action, a Jersey court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of
the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain
summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defence to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S.
judgment by a Jersey court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

        - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflicts of laws
principles;

         - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in
the court which pronounced it and being for a debt or definite sum of money (although there are
circumstances where non-money judgments can also be recognised);

        - the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy;

         - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in
respect of a penalty or fine;

         - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying, a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of
Section 5 of the United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to Jersey by the
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983);

         - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of natural justice
or rights under the European Convention on Human Rights; and

         - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same matter.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial matters
that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, Center Parcs cannot assure you that those judgments
will be recognised or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a Jersey court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Jersey, instead of the United States, and
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**England and Wales**

The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in England and
Wales is based upon advice provided to Center Parcs by its English legal advisors. The United States and the United
Kingdom currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as
opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment of a U.S. federal or state
court in relation to the obligations of the Issuer under the Note Trust Deed, the Offered Notes and the Subscription
Agreement will not be automatically enforceable in England and Wales, but a final and conclusive judgment for a debt or

361


-----

definite sum of money may be enforced at common law in England and Wales provided that the party against whom the
judgment was given properly submitted to the jurisdiction of the relevant courts (in accordance with English rules on the
conflict of laws), and none of the following circumstances applies:

        - the judgment was procured by fraud;

         - judgment was given contrary to the English rules of natural justice, for example the defendant was
deprived of notice of, or an adequate opportunity to take part in the proceedings, or substantial justice, in
that the defendant did not have the opportunity to correct procedural irregularities under the laws of the
court giving judgment;

         - recognition of the judgment would be contrary to English public policy;

         - recognition of the judgment would violate the Human Rights Act 1998;

         - the judgment conflicts with an English judgment or a foreign judgment given earlier in time that is
enforceable in an English court;

         - the proceedings that resulted in the judgment were brought in breach of a binding arbitration agreement
or a contractual choice of court agreement;

         - enforcement of the judgment would involve the enforcement of a foreign penal (which involves payment
to the State as distinct from an individual) or revenue or other public law;

         - enforcement of the judgment would contravene the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980, Section 5
of which precludes, among other things, the enforcement in the United Kingdom of any judgment given
by a court of an overseas country which is a judgment for multiple damages which exceed the
compensatory element of the judgment award; or

       - recognition or enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to the terms of the Administration of
Justice Act 1920 or the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933 or the Civil Jurisdiction
and Judgments Act 1982.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, Center Parcs cannot assure you
that those judgments will be enforceable in England and Wales.

In addition, an English court may decline to accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action
was commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, and was predicated solely upon a law other than the
law of England and Wales.

**Cayman Islands**

There is a procedure under Cayman Islands law for the registration of foreign judgments of superior courts for
the purposes of their enforcement under the Foreign Judgments Reciprocal Enforcement Law (1996 Revision) (the
“Foreign Judgments Law”). However, so far the Foreign Judgments Law has only been extended to certain superior
courts of Australia and its External Territories. Accordingly, judgments obtained in U.S. federal or state courts can only
be enforced in the Cayman Islands pursuant to Cayman Islands common law.

Subject to certain exceptions, a judgment obtained in a U.S. federal or state court may be enforced pursuant to
Cayman Islands common law without any re-examination of the merits if: (i) the judgment is an in personam judgment
under which a sum of money is payable (other than a sum of money payable in respect of taxes, fines or other penalties)
or, in certain circumstances, an in personam judgment for non-monetary relief; (ii) such U.S. court had proper
jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment as a matter of Cayman Islands conflict of law rules; (iii) the
judgment was not obtained by fraud; (iv) enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to Cayman Islands public
policy; (v) the proceedings in the U.S. court did not contravene rules of natural justice; and (vi) the judgment is final and
conclusive.

There is doubt, however, as to whether the Court will: (i) recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts based
on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state or other jurisdiction thereof; or (ii)
in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, impose liabilities upon the civil liability provisions of the securities
laws of the United States or any state or other jurisdiction thereof. The Court may also stay local proceedings if
concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.

 Strategic report  For the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020

The Directors present their Strategic report on the Group for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (2019: 52 weeks
ended 25 April 2019).

**Review of the Business**
The principal activity of the Group is the operation of short break holiday villages. The Center Parcs business
operates five holiday villages in the United Kingdom, at Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, Elveden Forest in
Suffolk, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Whinfell Forest in Cumbria and Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire. Center Parcs
targets the premium sector of the UK family short break market, offering an escape from the stresses and strains of
modern life and helping families come together.

Center Parcs invests heavily to ensure that we deliver high quality service, accommodation and facilities, combined
with an unrivalled array of activities that cater for the most discerning of families, as well as the most changeable of
British weather. There is nothing prescriptive about a short break at Center Parcs, with each family free to choose to
do as little or as much as they wish. Center Parcs remains a unique proposition for families in the UK market with a
history of consistently high occupancy and continued revenue and EBITDA growth, prior to the impact of the Covid19 pandemic (see below). This is combined with enviable guest feedback scores and consistently high levels of
returning guests.

Each of the Group’s holiday villages is set in a forest environment amongst approximately 400 acres of forest and
lakes and is normally open 365 days per year. Woodland, water and a natural environment are the essential
elements of a Center Parcs break. Within the comfortable, quiet and family-friendly setting, the Center Parcs villages
provide guests with high-quality accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. There are over 4,300
units of accommodation across the five villages. The focal point and key attraction of each village is an all-weather
indoor sub-tropical swimming paradise, featuring a selection of water activities including a wave pool, river slides and
rides, children’s pools and jacuzzis. Other on-site experiences include outdoor activities such as cycling, boating and
quadbikes; indoor activities such as ten-pin bowling, badminton and pottery; and leisure amenities such as spas,
dining and retail.

_Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic_

Following UK Government advice in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group’s five holiday villages were closed
to guests on 20 March 2020 and remained closed as at 23 April 2020. All guests who had their short breaks
cancelled due to the village closures were contacted and offered either a replacement holiday at a later date (with a
financial incentive) or a full refund of amounts paid. It was originally announced that the villages would remain closed
until 14 May 2020. However, in line with government guidance, as the pandemic worsened this was revised a
number of times until the villages were able to re-open on 13 July 2020, albeit with reduced accommodation capacity
and guest activities.

At the financial period-end approximately 90% of the Group’s employees were furloughed under the UK
Government’s Job Retention Scheme. The Group also benefited from the 12-month business rates holiday
announced for the leisure industry and agreed with HMRC that certain tax liabilities can be deferred.

In addition to Government support measures the Business took decisive action to reduce remaining operating costs
during the periods of closure. Residual operating costs of £11.0m were incurred in the period from closure on 20
March 2020 to the financial year-end on 23 April 2020. In the subsequent period to 13 July 2020 when the villages
remained closed, costs averaged between £6m and £7m every 4 weeks.

The Group continues to actively monitor developments and government advice and will increase available
accommodation capacity and guest activities as soon as it is safe and practicable to do so. Activities to ensure
adherence with this advice include hand sanitisation stations, deep cleaning of accommodation between departing
and arriving guests, increased cleaning and disinfection of public areas and social distancing measures throughout
the villages. This will enable guests to enjoy their breaks in the knowledge that the highest standards in relation to
Covid-19 have been put in place.

The Group also took swift action to ensure a strong liquidity position was maintained and promptly secured additional
funding from the Group’s owner, Brookfield. As at 15 July 2020, £139m of funds were provided with a further £21m
approved for use if required. In addition to this Brookfield have also indicated that additional funding could be made
available should the need arise.

###### Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited

 Strategic report  For the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)

_Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic (continued)_

Current trading patterns indicate there remains strong demand for the Group’s breaks through the third and fourth
quarters of our financial year ending 22 April 2021, with bookings for quarter four significantly ahead of the same time
last year as at 15 July 2020. Therefore, the fundamentals of the Company’s model remain sound and give comfort
that demand is there as operations resume.

Whilst at this stage it is too early to know the full impact of the pandemic on the financial year ending 22 April 2021,
the result and financial position of the Company is likely to be significantly impacted by the temporary suspension of
operations and the consequent refund of customer deposits.

_Going concern_

As described in note 1, the Directors have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis as they
believe the actions taken to date, together with the Group’s current liquidity position and contingency plans to secure
additional funding, will allow the Group to continue its activities. However, although the Directors are confident in the
Group’s current position, given the village closures until 13 July 2020 and an uncertain pace of recovery, the
Directors recognise that there exists a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the application of
the going concern assumption in the financial statements.

_Financial performance_

The results of the Group for the period show a profit after taxation of £23.0 million (2019: profit of £62.8 million).
Adjusted EBITDA, being earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional/non-underlying
items was £200.0 million (2019: £232.6 million). These results were negatively impacted by the closure of the UK
holiday villages on 20 March 2020 in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, as set out in note 5.

During the period the Group incurred exceptional/non-underlying administrative costs of £2.2 million, representing
£2.0 million in respect of costs to exit a contract and £0.2 million of legal and other associated costs relating to an
equity contribution provided by the Group’s parent company. Taxation on these expenses has also been treated as
an exceptional/non-underlying item, as has the impact of the change in applicable deferred tax rate from 17% to 19%.

During the prior period ended 25 April 2019, the Group incurred an exceptional/non-underlying finance cost of £7.7
million in respect of a refinancing of the Group’s debt. Taxation on this expense was also treated as an
exceptional/non-underlying item.

**Key performance indicators**
The Directors use the following key performance indicators to set targets and measure performance:

  - Revenue: Revenue for the period was £443.7 million (2019: £480.2 million).

  - Adjusted EBITDA: Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional/nonunderlying items. Adjusted EBITDA for the period was £200.0 million (2019: £232.6 million).

  - Occupancy: the average number of units of accommodation occupied as a percentage of the total number
available. Occupancy for the period was 88.0% (2019: 97.1%).

  - ADR (Average Daily Rate): the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total accommodation
income divided by the total number of lodge nights sold. ADR for the period was £194.91 (2019: £191.74).

  - RevPAL (Rent per available lodge night): the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total
accommodation income divided by the total available number of lodge nights. RevPAL for the period was
£171.54 (2019: £186.08).

The key performance indicators above were negatively impacted by the closure of the UK holiday villages on 20
March 2020 in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.

###### Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited

 Strategic report  For the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)

**Principal risks and uncertainties**
The Directors and senior managers adopt a proactive approach to the management of potential risks and
uncertainties which could have a material impact on the performance of the business and execution of its growth
strategy, and are actively involved in the Group’s Risk Committee. In addition to ongoing monitoring, this Risk
Committee meets quarterly to oversee risk management arrangements and ensure appropriate processes are put in
place to mitigate potential risks and uncertainties. The Fire, Health and Safety Steering Committee also meets bimonthly to oversee operational risks.

There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the Group’s
performance and execution of its growth strategy. These risks include, but are not limited to:

Operational risk factors

_Health and safety_
The health, safety and welfare of the Group’s guests and employees are central to its operations. The Group is
committed to maintaining industry leading standards in health and safety including fire and food safety and adopts a
proactive approach to its safety management. All incidents are recorded and reviewed to monitor trends and capture
learning points that are then integrated into the business. The Fire, Health and Safety Steering Committee reviews
major incidents and is focused on continuous improvement to mitigate the risk.

_Business continuity_
The Group operates five holiday villages in the United Kingdom and a significant interruption of any one would have a
material impact on the Group. As a result, the Risk Committee supervises comprehensive risk management
arrangements including business continuity plans which are regularly tested with the support of external specialists.
These arrangements are supported by a broad insurance programme. The revenue loss resulting from the closure of
the villages due to the Covid-19 pandemic was not covered by the Group’s insurance.

_Supply chain_
The Group has a large number of suppliers and prides itself on the quality of its product. The Group could be
adversely affected by a fall in the standard of goods or services supplied by third parties or by a failure of a key
partner. Quality risks are mitigated via a robust supplier registration system with food and safety further supported by
independent advisors. In addition, the Risk Committee considers supply chain contingency arrangements and takes
appropriate measures to mitigate this risk.

_Contractual arrangements_
The Group has contracts with third parties for the supply of goods and services. Contracts are negotiated at arms’
length and the Group does not enter into contracts that are outside the ordinary course of business or those that
contain onerous terms. The Group adopts a compliance programme to ensure that it is compliant with its material
contractual commitments. There is no single contractual counterparty that is critical to the running of the business.
The failure of any critical contractual counterparty is managed through supply chain contingency arrangements (see
Supply chain).

_Employees_
The Group’s performance largely depends on its managers and staff, both on the villages and at head office. The
resignation of key individuals or the inability to recruit staff with the right experience and skills could adversely impact
the Group’s results. To mitigate these issues the Group has invested in training programmes for its staff and has a
number of bonus schemes linked to the Group’s results and achievement against key performance indicators linked
to guest satisfaction that are designed to reward and retain key individuals.

_Input price increases_
The Group’s margin can be adversely affected by an increase in the price of key costs to the business including, but
not limited to, wages, overheads and utilities. The Group takes proactive steps to manage any such increases
including cost control, forward buying and budgeting for any increase.

_Brand_
The Center Parcs brand could be adversely affected by a serious incident, accident or similar occurrence or just a
slow decline in the brand’s appeal to consumers. The Group mitigates the risk of a serious incident, accident or
similar occurrence by maintaining industry-leading health and safety systems and standards of training. The risk of a
slow decline in the brand’s appeal is managed through continuous product innovation, marketing campaigns and
brand development.

 Strategic report  For the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)

**Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)**

_Fraud_
The Group operates five sites across the United Kingdom. Risk of fraud exists in misappropriation of assets,
including banking, theft of stock and theft of cash takings. The Group mitigates this risk through the management
structure and regular financial review with, and extensive use of, business systems. In addition, the Group’s internal
audit function undertakes regular reviews of financial controls with particular focus on cash and stock transactions.
The Group is also subject to regular external audits.

Market risk factors

_General Economic conditions_
The disposable income of the Group’s guests and/or their holiday preferences are and will be affected by changes in
the general economic environment and this may result in a fall in the number of guests and/or a decrease in on-site
expenditure. The Group regularly reviews its product offering and engages with guests to ensure it provides value for
money to meet guest needs.

_Brexit_
Until the terms of the UK’s formal exit from the European Union are finalised it remains difficult for businesses to
predict the impact it will have on them and their financial performance. Thus far, the formal exit as not had a material
impact on the business of Center Parcs. However, we will continue to monitor political and economic developments
and have plans in place for all eventualities.

_Covid-19 pandemic_
Starting with the closure of the villages in March 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the
Group’s business. Whilst the villages are now re-opened the situation continues to evolve with government advice
being regularly updated. The measures mandated by the government are outside the control of the Group.
However, the Group has experienced teams who are capable of managing the impacts of the disruption on guests,
colleagues and other key stakeholders. These teams have already put in place procedures to ensure the safe reopening of the villages and will continue to monitor changing advice and implement further procedures as required.

Although the villages are now open it is not clear how long government restrictions and social distancing measures
will last, or whether tighter restrictions will be reintroduced resulting in one or more villages having to close again. It
is therefore not certain how quickly operations will return to pre-crisis levels.

If these risks and uncertainties materialise, they could result in a material change in the forecast liquidity position of
the Group.

_Competition_
The Center Parcs brand is synonymous with high quality short breaks in a forest environment but the Group
competes for the discretionary expenditure of potential guests, who could choose to take short breaks at other
destinations or participate in other recreational activities. The Directors believe that this risk is mitigated by the
strength of the Center Parcs brand and the continual investment in the accommodation and central facilities
(including retail and restaurants), coupled with the innovation amongst the leisure activities and the responsiveness
to guest surveys.

_Seasonality and weather_
Demand for short breaks is influenced by the main holiday periods at Easter, the Summer holidays and the
Christmas/New year period. This risk is mitigated by online dynamic pricing which encourages demand outside of
the peak periods. The accommodation is located within forest environments and a significant number of activities
take place outdoors. Therefore, demand may be impacted by the prevailing weather. This risk is minimal because
guests tend not to book on impulse and the vast majority of breaks and activities are booked in advance.
Additionally, the Group maintains diversity between its indoor and outdoor activities to mitigate this risk.

###### Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited

 Strategic report  For the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)

**Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)**

Financial risks
The Directors and senior managers regularly review the financial requirements of the Group and the associated risks.
The Group does not use complicated financial instruments and where financial instruments are used they are used to
reduce interest rate risk. The Group does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. The Group finances its
operations and developments through a mixture of retained earnings and borrowings as required. Historically, the
Group has sought to reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Group funding using the underlying
asset value.

All tranches of the Group’s secured debt are subject to financial covenants. The Directors have assessed future
compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial covenants.

_Interest rate risk_
Principal sources of borrowings are fixed interest rate loan notes.

_Liquidity risk_
The Group maintains sufficient levels of cash and committed funding to enable it to meet its medium-term working
capital, lease liability and funding obligations. Rolling forecasts of liquidity requirements are prepared and monitored,
and surplus cash is invested in interest bearing accounts.

_Currency risk_
Whilst no borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies, a number of suppliers are exposed to the Euro and US
Dollar. Accordingly, wherever possible the Group enters into supply contracts denominated in Sterling. The Group
does not operate a hedging facility to manage currency risk as it is not considered to be material.

_Credit risk_
The Group’s cash balances are held on deposit with a number of UK banking institutions. Credit risk in respect of the
Group’s revenue streams is limited as the vast majority of customers pay in advance.

_Financial reporting risk_
The Group’s financial systems are required to process a large number of transactions securely and accurately; any
weaknesses in the systems could result in the incorrect reporting of financial results and covenant compliance. This
risk is mitigated by the production of detailed management accounts which are regularly compared to budgets and
forecasts. The Group is also subject to an annual external audit.

 Strategic report  For the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)

**Section 172 Statement and our stakeholders**

We report here on how our Directors have discharged their duties under Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 and
this statement reflects the contribution by the Group to the performance of the Center Parcs business.

Section 172 sets out the matters to which the Directors must have regard to in performing their duty to promote the
success of the Group for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes having regard to other stakeholders and the
likely consequences of any decision in the longer term. The Board considers it crucial that the Group maintains a
reputation for high standards of business conduct.

The Board is responsible for setting, monitoring and upholding the culture, values, standards, ethics, brand and
reputation of the Group, to ensure that our obligations to our guests, employees, shareholder and others are met.
Management drives the embedding of the culture and values throughout the business. The Board monitors
adherence to the Center Parcs policies and compliance with corporate governance requirements. The Board also
considers the wider social issues within which our businesses operate, including the environment and the local
communities in which our villages are situated. We look to build relationships with all our stakeholders based on
openness and continuing dialogue. We value diversity and inclusivity in our workforce and beyond and the employee
section of this report provides further details.

The Board considers the likely consequences of any decision in the long term and identifies stakeholders who may
be affected and carefully considers their interests and any potential impact as part of the Board’s decision-making
process.

In March 2020, following legislation passed by the UK Government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the
Group’s five holiday villages were closed to guests and remained closed as at 23 April 2020. Given the risk posed by
the Covid-19 pandemic, the health, safety and well-being of our employees and guests was our highest priority
throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. We also considered the interests of our shareholders, suppliers and other
stakeholders during this period. Guests who had their short breaks cancelled due to the village closures were
contacted and offered either a replacement holiday at a later date or a full refund of amounts paid. Employees who
were furloughed under the UK Government’s Job Retention Scheme received top up payments. Communications
with our employees, guests and other stakeholders were open, transparent and timely throughout this rapidly
evolving period.

 Directors’ report  For the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020

The Directors present their report and the audited consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 23 April
2020 (2019: 52 weeks ended 25 April 2019).

The registration number of the Company is 07656429.

Information about the use of financial instruments by the Group is provided in note 17 to the financial statements.

**Future developments**

No changes to the nature of the business are anticipated in the longer term, but trading practices are expected to be
different in the short-term in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.

On 29 July 2019, Center Parcs Ireland Limited, a related party company, opened a new Center Parcs holiday village
in the Republic of Ireland. Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and Center Parcs Ireland Limited have the same
ultimate parent company.

**Dividends**
During the period the Company paid dividends totalling £61.2 million (2019: £183.2 million). Of this total, the
Company distributed cash of £61.2 million and receivables of £nil (2019: cash of £183.0 million and receivables of
£0.2 million). The Directors have not proposed the payment of a final dividend (2019: final dividend of £20.1 million).

**Directors**
The Directors who served during the period and up to the date of this report, unless otherwise stated, were as
follows:

M P Dalby
C G McKinlay
Z B Vaughan
K O McCrain (resigned on 11 May 2020)
N J Adomait
B T Annable (appointed on 11 May 2020)

The Group headed by Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited maintains Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance in
respect of legal action that might be brought against its Directors and Officers that may be incurred as a result of their
position within the Company and the companies within the Group. The Directors and Officers have the benefit of an
Indemnity provision in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. These indemnities were in place for
the whole of the period ended 23 April 2020 and as at the date of this report.

**Employees**
The Group is committed to providing equal opportunities to all employees, irrespective of their gender, sexual
orientation, marital status, race, nationality, ethnic origin, disability, age or religion. Center Parcs is an inclusive
employer and values diversity among its employees. These commitments extend to recruitment and selection,
training, career development, flexible working arrangements, promotion and performance appraisal.

_Disabled employees_
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the
applicant concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled every effort is made to ensure that their
employment with the Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the
training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of
other employees.

_Employee consultation_
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and has continued to keep them informed
on matters affecting them as employees and on the various factors affecting the performance of the Group. This is
principally achieved through formal and informal briefings, the quarterly internal Group magazine ‘Center Forward’
and annual presentations of the financial results by the CEO. Employee representatives are consulted regularly on a
wide range of matters affecting their current and future interests, via village and head office council meetings which
take place four times a year. In addition, all employees with more than six months’ service receive an annual bonus
related to the overall profitability of the Group.

**Political donations**
No political donations were made in the current or prior period.

  - Employing a dedicated Corporate Sustainability Manager who, along with the village teams, continues to
drive energy efficiency initiatives across the business and ensures best practice is adopted at all locations.

  - Village EMS action groups actively manage standards, monitor performance and encourage and implement
energy efficiency and environmentally beneficial initiatives.

  - Additional sub-metering data to drive carefully targeted efficiency actions.

  - Compliance with the newly introduced ISO4001 certification standard which places greater emphasis on the
active management of Directors and Senior Management in driving efficiencies and standards. All
2019/2020 interim external audits were passed with no non-conformities.

  - Continuing to investigate and implement large scale carbon reduction schemes at our villages, including
Anaerobic Digestion and Solar Farms.

  - Ongoing development of our long-term sustainability for the next five and ten years, creating a clear vision of
achievements by 2030.

  - Continuing to expand our use of EV across the village and head office vehicles, including the investigation of
greater provision of EV charge points.

 Directors' report For the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)

**Directors' Responsibilities Statement**
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic report, the Directors' report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period. Under that law the
Directors have prepared the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial
statements, the Directors are required to:

            - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

            - make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

            - state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been followed; and

            - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group
and Company will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Group's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on
the Group's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

**Statement of disclosure of infonnation to the auditor**
In accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, in the case of each Director in office at the date the
Directors' report is approved, the following applies:

a) so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group's auditor is
unaware; and
b) he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make him/herself
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group's auditor is aware of that information.

**Independent auditor**
Deloitte LLP are deemed to be reappointed under section 487 (2) of the Companies Act 2006.

###### Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited

 Independent auditor’s report to the members of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited

**Report on the audit of the financial statements**

**Opinion**

In our opinion:

   - the financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries
(the ‘Group’) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at
23 April 2020 and of the Group’s profit for the 52 weeks then ended;

   - the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union;

   - the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act
2006; and

   - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006.

We have audited the financial statements which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of
Comprehensive Income, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent Company Cash
Flow Statements, the Group and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 30.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.

**Basis for opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’)
Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Material uncertainty related to going concern**
We draw attention to Note 1 in the financial statements, which indicates that as a result of the adverse impacts of
COVID-19 on both Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited directly and the wider travel, hospitality and leisure industry,
there is uncertainty in relation to forecasting the nature and extent of government and social distancing restrictions
that would impact the villages, the impact of consumer sentiment and hence the length of time it will take to achieve
a full recovery, uncertainty in relation to the ability of the Company to secure additional funding which may be
required in certain scenarios and uncertainty over the ability of the Company to obtain waivers for any forecast
potential breach of financial covenants. As stated in Note 1, these events or conditions, along with the other matters
as set forth in Note 1 to the financial statements, indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant
doubt on the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

**Other information**
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in
the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to
report that fact.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.


-----

###### Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited

 Independent auditor’s report to the members of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited (continued)

**Responsibilities of Directors**
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as
the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on FRC’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

**Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

   - the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

   - the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the Parent Company and their environment
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic report or the
Directors’ report.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report in respect of the following matters if, in our opinion:

   - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

   - the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

   - certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

   - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

**Use of our report**
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

###### Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020**

###### 1. Accounting policies

**General information**
The Company is a private company limited by shares, which is incorporated and domiciled in the UK, and is
registered in England and Wales. The address of its registered office is One Edison Rise, New Ollerton, Newark,
Nottinghamshire, NG22 9DP.

**Basis of preparation**
These consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (2019: 52 weeks ended 25 April 2019)
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC) and Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) interpretations adopted by the European Union and with those
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments and
retirement benefit obligations. All accounting policies disclosed have been applied consistently to both periods
presented. The impact on retained earnings of the adoption of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ in the prior period is set out in note
16 to these financial statements.

The accounting reference date of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited is 22 April.

**Going concern**
The Group reported a profit for the year of £23.0m (2019 £62.8m) and generated operating cash inflows of £151.2m
(2019 £225.2m). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The
Directors consider this to be appropriate for the reasons set out below.

_Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic_
As at the date of approving these financial statements the impacts of Covid-19 on the Group’ trading have been
assessed. Government response to the pandemic continues to evolve and customer sentiment to short break
holidays remains uncertain although there are indications of strong demand for Center Parcs breaks. As such, the
Group will continue to monitor and re-assess the impact of the pandemic.

Due to measures taken by the UK Government all UK villages were closed to guests on 20 March 2020 and
remained closed until 13 July 2020. This resulted in all affected guests in that period being offered either a full refund
or the option to move their break to a later date. During the closure period, the Group reported no revenue and whilst
there has been a corresponding reduction in variable costs, the Group had to fund its fixed costs and refund guests
for breaks that were cancelled. Where possible mitigating actions have been taken by management to minimise such
costs. Refunds of £62 million have been given to affected guests as at the date of issuance of these financial
statements.

On 13 July 2020 all UK villages re-opened to guests albeit with social distancing restrictions in place. These
restrictions result in reduced available accommodation capacity and on-site activities which are likely to remain
impacted until such restrictions are lifted. Whilst it is difficult to predict the future with any certainty, we currently do
not anticipate a return to pre-Covid trading levels until early in calendar year 2021. However, demand for the Group’s
breaks do remain strong and current forward bookings for the final quarter of the financial year ending 22 April 2021
are ahead of those seen for the equivalent period in the year to 23 April 2020 at this time last year.

In order to preserve liquidity during the closure period, the Group took the following measures:

  - Secured additional funding from the Group’s owner, Brookfield. As at 15 July 2020 they had provided
funding of £139 million of funds to ensure the liquidity of the Group. Further committed funds of £21 million
are approved for use if required and Brookfield have indicated that additional funding could be made
available should the need arise.

  - A significant element of the Group’s cost base relates to wages and salaries. The majority of the Group’s
staff were furloughed during the period of closure with the Group benefitting from the Government’s job
retention scheme. The hours of remaining staff undertaking essential activities were reviewed to further
reduce costs where possible.

  - Reviewed all remaining areas of operating cost to eliminate all non-essential expenditure.

  - Agreed deferrals of certain tax payments and benefitted from Business rates relief.

  - Reviewed capital expenditure and delayed certain non-essential projects.

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)**

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Going concern (continued)**

The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for a period of 18 months from the date of approval of these
financial statements which indicate that, under the re-opening scenario noted above, the Group will have sufficient
funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due for that period. Under this scenario there would be no breach of lending
facilities. Other than £0.1m of mortgage repayments there are no capital repayments of debt falling due within the
forecast period.

With regard to this forecast and other factors which may impact the Group’s future liquidity position, the Directors
have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. However, given
that the Covid-19 situation continues to evolve, there exists a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that
may cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

The events or conditions are as follows:

  - As at the date of approval of these financial statements the Group has cash balances of £102 million. The
Group’s owner, Brookfield, has already provided £139 million of funds to ensure the liquidity of the Group.
Further committed funds of £21 million are approved for use if required and Brookfield have indicated that
additional funding could be made available should the need arise. However, as noted elsewhere, there
remains some uncertainty with regards forecasting both the pace of recovery and the eventual levels to
which trading will return and accordingly it is possible that further funding will be required that as at the date
of approval of these financial statements has not yet been secured.

  - Depending on how quickly the Group’s trading recovers or if there are further Government imposed
restrictions that result in the closure of one or more villages for a period of time, there is a risk that existing
financial covenants will be breached although the Directors have taken a number of actions to mitigate the
risk and as at the date of approval of these financial statements do not anticipate any breaches.

  - The Group has only recently recommenced operations, in line with UK Government advice. As at the current
date there remains a requirement to ensure certain social distancing measures are in place and certain
activities are not as yet able to operate. As a result, these measures may have a significant impact on the
format of the breaks in the near term. While there are indications of strong demand for the Group’s breaks
with bookings for the fourth quarter significantly ahead of the prior year, the ability to initially operate at the
previous high levels of occupancy will be restricted. While the fundamentals of the Group’s model remain
sound, the above factors naturally create challenges in the ability to accurately forecast the cash flows of the
Group.

The Directors have already taken a number of measures as described above to manage the Group’s liquidity
position. In the light of these material uncertainties and in the case where further funding was not forthcoming, the
Directors have a range of further measures which are within their control, to protect the Group’s liquidity position even
further, including:

  - Further encouragement for customers to change their break to a future date in the event of a cancellation of
their break rather than receiving a full refund.

  - Additional changes to working arrangements to reduce staff costs further.

  - Negotiations with HMRC for further delay of payroll and indirect tax payments.

  - A £90 million committed liquidity facility that remains undrawn. This is available to pay certain senior
expenses and Class A note interest.

The Directors believe the cash flow forecast outlined above is reasonable in light of the re-opening of the villages and
the current Government risk levels. However, COVID-19’s continued presence may see a change in Government
advice and/or further periods of lock down in the future. Such lock downs could result in further village closures on a
national or regional level or affect the ability of guests and employees to travel to site. These uncertainties clearly
introduce a level of subjectivity in assessing assumptions to be used in a downside case. However, the Directors
have prepared downside forecasts which assume the closure of one village for a period of eight weeks or two villages
for a period of four weeks.

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)**

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Going concern (continued)**

As with the base case scenario this downside case would not see the Group breach lending covenants or suffer a
liquidity shortage. However, were the Group to require access to further liquidity this could be sought from the
Group’s owner. The Directors believe that this support would be available and forthcoming for a number of reasons
including:

  - Previous actions and commitments in supporting the Group with £139 million already provided and a further
£21 million approved for use if required.

  - Center Parcs’ potential value to Brookfield is very significant and hence injection of further cash to protect
this value could reasonably be expected.

  - BSREP II is one of Brookfield Asset Management’s flagship funds which closed with total equity
commitments of $9 billion. BSREP II still has equity commitments available to satisfy any needed follow-on
capital calls from existing investments and expenses or other liabilities.

  - Brookfield have provided a letter of support to the Directors of the Group indicating their intention to provide
such funding in the event that it is required.

  - Three of the Group’s Directors are “Investor Directors” appointed by the Group’s owners. They are uniquely
placed to understand both the Group’s business and potential actions by the owners. They have indicated
that they believe it reasonable to believe support would be made available.

However, ultimately there is no guarantee that this support would be provided and as a consequence there exists a
material uncertainty that additional funding may not be available.

As a result of the options available to them the Directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial
statements on a going concern basis. However, the circumstances described above represent a material uncertainty
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, to continue
realising its assets and discharging its liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that would result from the basis of preparation being inappropriate.

**Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited (‘the
Company’) and entities controlled by the Company. A company controls another entity when it is exposed, or has
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with that entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over that entity.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of CPUK Finance Limited, a company set up with the
sole purpose of issuing debt secured on assets owned by the Group. The Directors of Center Parcs (Holdings 1)
Limited consider this company meets the definition of a structured entity under IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial
statements’ and hence for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements it has been treated as a subsidiary
undertaking. Details of this company are provided in note 28.

The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared for the same financial reporting period as the
Company.

The consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited have been prepared under the principles
of predecessor accounting and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts. This accounting
treatment results in differences on consolidation between consideration and the fair value of underlying net assets
and this difference is included within equity as an other reserve.

On 11 June 2015 the Group acquired CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited; prior to that date both the Group
and CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited were under the common control of the parent company CP Cayman
Midco 1 Limited. The acquisition formed part of a group reconstruction and has been accounted for using merger
accounting principles which present the financial statements as if CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited had
always been part of the Group using the pre-combination carrying values.

Under merger accounting principles, the assets and liabilities of CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited have been
consolidated based on their pre-combination book values and the difference between the consideration payable and
the book values of the net assets is recorded in equity in the other reserve.

**for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)**

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**
The preparation of financial statements requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies

_Discount rate used to determine the value of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation (note 25):_
The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation is discounted at a rate set by reference to market yields at
the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Significant judgment is required when setting the
criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

_Useful economic lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets (notes 9/10):_
The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets at the end
of each reporting period. During the current period, the Directors have concluded that no revision is required to either
useful economic lives or residual values of these assets, and that residual values exceed carrying values.

_Impairment test for goodwill (note 8):_
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to
which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate future cash flows
expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.

**Revenue**
Revenue relates to accommodation rental income on holidays commenced during the period, together with other
related income that primarily arises from on-village leisure, retail and food and beverage spend. Revenue relating to
accommodation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the holiday. The performance obligation for
non-rental income, and hence the basis for revenue recognition, is when the related product or service is provided to
the guest. All revenue is recorded net of VAT.

Payment for accommodation rental income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded as
‘deferred income’ within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences. As such, no revenue was
recognised during the period the villages were closed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

A number of trading units on each holiday village are operated by concession partners. Revenue due in respect of
such units is recognised on an accruals basis. All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.

For disaggregation purposes, revenue as presented in note 2 is split between accommodation and on-site spend.

**Cost of sales**
Cost of sales comprise the cost of goods and services provided to guests. All costs to the point of sale, including
direct employee costs, are included within cost of sales. Depreciation and amortisation charges are not considered
part of cost of sales.

**Operating segments**
The operating segments set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements are consistent with the internal
reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. The Chief
Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.

**Exceptional/non-underlying items**
Exceptional/non-underlying items are defined as those that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency,
warrant separate disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the
Group. Non-underlying items are those that are not directly related to the ongoing trade of the business or that are
unrepresentative of ongoing performance. Examples of exceptional/non-underlying items are the costs of Group
restructures, expenses incurred when refinancing debt and movements in the fair value of embedded derivatives.

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Goodwill**
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is instead tested
for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is allocated to
cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.

**Other intangible assets**
_Software_
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the
specific software. These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are
generally considered to be either four or seven years.

Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the
Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as
intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of
relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated
useful lives.

_Other intangible assets_
Other purchased intangible assets are capitalised at cost, amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful
economic lives and tested for impairment annually. The brand is not amortised as it is considered to have an
indefinite life; the carrying value of the brand is subject to an annual impairment review.

**Impairment of assets**
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not
subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and whenever there is an indication at the end of a
reporting period that the asset may be impaired. Assets that are subject to depreciation and amortisation are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-inuse. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).

**Property, plant and equipment**
The Directors chose the cost basis under IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’, rather than to apply the alternative
(revaluation) treatment to all items of property, plant and equipment as its ongoing accounting policy. The cost of
property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable costs.

Depreciation is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment (except assets in the course of construction)
so as to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the
assets concerned, which are typically as follows:

Installations 10 to 20 years
Fixtures and fittings 5 to 10 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Computer hardware 4 years

Buildings are depreciated to residual value over 50 years. Land is not depreciated. The Group’s water boreholes are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over 13 years.

Useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and revised where expectations are
significantly different from previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for current and future periods
is adjusted accordingly.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the
cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other
borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the year in which they are incurred.

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)**

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Maintenance expenditure**
It is the policy of the Group to maintain its land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance expenditure
increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to generate, this expenditure is capitalised. All
other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

**Leases**
The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of a contract. The Group recognises a
right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee,
except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value
assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which
economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the
Group calculates an appropriate incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

  - Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives;

  - Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

  - The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

  - The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and

  - Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to
terminate the lease.

Lease liabilities are subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease
liabilities (using the effective interest rate method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments
made. The Group remeasures the lease liabilities (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use
assets) whenever:

  - The lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in
which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised
discount rate.

  - The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a
guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating
interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used).

  - A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which
case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount
rate.

The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made
at or before the commencement date and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which
it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a
provision is recognised and measured under IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’. The
costs are included in the related right-of-use asset.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a
lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects
to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset.
The deprecation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and
the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognised as an administrative expense in the consolidated
income statement in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)**

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Investments in subsidiary undertakings**
Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment. If there are indications of impairment, an
assessment is made of the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement when the
recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. Dividends receivable from investments in subsidiary
undertakings are recognised in the income statement when approved by the shareholders of the company paying the
dividend.

**Current and deferred tax**
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. The current tax charge is calculated on the
basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount
expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed by
the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are defined
as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Such assets and liabilities
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither
the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax on properties assumes recovery through sale.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the assets can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the
related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Inventories**
The basis of valuation of inventories is the lower of cost on a first in first out basis and estimated net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable selling
expenses. Inventory provisions are created where necessary to ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of cost
and estimated net realisable value.

**Financial instruments**
The Group classifies its financial assets into two categories, being those measured at amortised cost and those
measured at fair value. Where assets are measured at fair value gains and losses are recognised either in the
income statement or in other comprehensive income, depending on the nature of the asset. Financial assets are
included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date which are
classified as non-current assets

Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial liabilities. The
classification depends on the nature of the financial instrument acquired. Other financial liabilities are carried at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Trade receivables**
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less any expected credit
losses.

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Cash and cash equivalents**
For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at
bank and cash in hand.

**Borrowings**
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**Borrowing costs**
Interest on borrowings is treated as an expense in the income statement, with the exception of interest costs incurred
on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.

**Early termination costs**
Costs associated with the early repayment of borrowings are written off to the income statement as incurred.

**Derivative financial instruments**
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments have historically been
used by the Group to manage its exposure to interest rates on long-term floating-rate borrowings. All derivative
financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value. The Group does not currently hedge
account for any derivatives. As such, any gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the income statement.

**Embedded derivatives**
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not
measured at fair value through profit and loss.

**Trade payables**
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**Provisions**
Provisions for legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where there are a
number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering
the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any
one item included in the same class of obligations is small.

**Dividend distribution**
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.

**Foreign currencies**
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the
rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.

**Employee benefits**
_Pensions_

- Defined contribution pension scheme

Group employees can choose to be a member of a defined contribution pension scheme. A defined contribution
pension scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The
Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to
pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions are
charged to the income statement as incurred.

- Defined benefit pension scheme

A funded senior management defined benefit pension scheme also exists. A defined benefit pension scheme is a
pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

The surplus or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together
with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates for
high-quality corporate bonds, which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Remeasurement gains and losses are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

_Profit-sharing and bonus plans_
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into
consideration the profit attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises
a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

_Holiday pay_
The Group recognises an appropriate liability for the cost of holiday entitlements not taken at the balance sheet date.

**Share capital**
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds.

**Other reserve**
The other reserve in the consolidated financial statements represents the differences on consolidation arising on the
adoption of predecessor accounting. This comprises the difference between consideration paid and the book value
of net assets acquired in the transaction.

**New standards and interpretations**
A number of new or revised accounting standards were effective for the first time in the current period. None of these
have significantly impacted the financial statements of the Group or Company and are unlikely to have a material
impact in the future.

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has issued the following new or revised standards and
interpretations with an effective date for financial periods beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and
therefore after the date of these financial statements. The IASB has also issued a number of minor amendments to
standards as part of their annual improvement process.

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating
Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as
the Board of Directors.

The operating segments are the five holiday villages that the business operates. Central Services costs are centrally
managed administration costs. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s
accounting policies described in note 1.

The primary profit measure used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker is EBITDA before nonunderlying/exceptional items, being earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and
exceptional/non-underlying items. The internal reporting does not disaggregate the balance sheet to each operating
segment.

The split of revenue by business stream was £269.9 million (2019: £290.6 million) for accommodation and £173.8

respect of costs to exit a contract and £0.2 million of legal and other associated costs relating to the equity
contribution provided by the Group’s parent company in light of the Covid-19 pandemic (note 19). Taxation on these
expenses has also been treated as an exceptional/non-underlying item, as has the impact of the change in
applicable deferred tax rate from 17% to 19%.

The £7.7 million exceptional/non-underlying finance expense in the prior period represented the premium paid on the
settlement of the A3 tranche of the Group’s secured debt of £6.1 million and accelerated amortisation of deferred
issue costs in respect of the A3 tranche of £1.6 million. Taxation on this expense was also treated as an
exceptional/non-underlying item.

###### 8. Goodwill

**Group**
**Cost and net book value** **£m**
At 23 April 2020, 25 April 2019 and 26 April 2018 **157.5**

**Impairment test for goodwill**
Goodwill relates to the acquisition of the Sherwood, Elveden, Longleat and Whinfell Villages only. It is allocated
equally to four cash-generating units (CGUs), being the four villages.

The Directors consider that the economic characteristics and future expectations are materially consistent across
each of the four villages.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash
flow projections based on financial forecasts prepared by management covering a rolling five-year period.

**Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations**

The value-in-use calculation is based on forecasts approved by the Board covering the next ten years with a terminal
value applied after year five. The cash flow assumptions in the calculation reflect the anticipated impact of the Covid19 pandemic, using the Directors’ base case scenario as discussed in note 1.

The key assumptions of the value-in-use calculation are Adjusted EBITDA margin, growth rates and the discount
rate; the long-term growth rate applied is 2.0% (2019: 2.0%) and the discount rate applied is 10.8% (2019: 8.7%).

Management determine forecast Adjusted EBITDA margins based on past performance and expectations of market
development. The growth rates used reflect management’s expectations of the future market. Discount rates used
are pre-tax and reflect the specific risks to the Group.

Based on the value-in-use calculations performed, the Directors have concluded that there is no impairment of
goodwill. The Directors have performed sensitivity analysis using the full range of reasonable assumptions and no
impairment triggers have been identified.

The Company has no goodwill.

All amounts owed to related parties and Group undertakings at the current and prior period-end are unsecured and
repayable on demand.

Deferred income represents revenues received at the period end date that relate to future periods; the principal
component is accommodation income. Deferred income principally relates to bookings for holidays in the 12 months
immediately following the balance sheet date; approximately 1% of bookings relate to the subsequent year.

As at 23 April 2020 all breaks with guest departure dates up to and including 13 May 2020 had been cancelled, as a
result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and therefore amounts owed to guests in respect of those breaks has been
presented as other financial liabilities. The re-opening date for the UK villages was subsequently postponed until 13
July 2020 and hence a proportion of liabilities categorised as deferred income in the above table were ultimately
reclassified to other financial liabilities and refunded to guests.

**Fair value hierarchy**
IFRS 13 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value
hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

All of the Group’s secured borrowings have been categorised as Level 1 (2019: Level 1) and fair values have been
derived from unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets.

**for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)**

###### 17. Financial instruments (continued)

**Financial risk management**
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity and borrowings as required. The Group has sought to
reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Group’s funding using the underlying asset value. All
tranches of the Group’s secured debt are subject to financial covenants. The Directors have assessed future
compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial covenants. The overall policy in respect of
interest rates is to reduce the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and the Group’s primary source of
borrowings is fixed interest rate loan notes. The Group does not actively trade in derivative financial instruments.

**Interest rate risk**
As at 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 the Group had fixed rate loan notes and a floating rate mortgage as its only
external funding sources.

**Liquidity risk**
As at 23 April 2020, the Group held sufficient levels of cash and committed funding to enable it to meet its mediumterm working capital, lease liability and funding obligations. Rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements are
prepared and monitored, and surplus cash is invested in interest bearing accounts.

**Currency risk**
The Group is exposed to limited currency risk through foreign currency transactions. The Group does not operate a
hedging facility to manage currency risk as it is considered to be insignificant.

**Credit risk**
The Group borrows from well-established institutions with high credit ratings. The Group’s cash balances are held on
deposit with a number of UK banking institutions.

included within other receivables.

###### 25. Pension commitments

**Defined contribution pension scheme**

The Group participates in the Center Parcs pension scheme, which is a defined contribution pension scheme with a
contributory and a non-contributory membership level. Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme for the
period ended 23 April 2020 were £3.3 million (2019: £2.9 million).

Accruals per note 12 include £0.5 million (2019: £0.5 million) in respect of defined contribution pension scheme costs.

**Defined benefit pension scheme**

The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme for certain employees. Contributions are determined
by an independent qualified actuary using assumptions on the rate of return on investments and rates of increases in
salaries and benefits.

The last available actuarial valuation of the scheme at the balance sheet date was that performed as at 31 July 2017.
This was updated to 23 April 2020 by a qualified independent actuary.

The impact of guaranteed minimum pensions (“GMP”) equalisation is expected to be less than £0.1 million.

In November 2019 the Trustees decided to move to a fiduciary management arrangement. The aim of this change
was to increase the target return of the Scheme’s portfolio, while retaining the same level of risk as the previous
investment strategy. To meet the required risk and return characteristics of the new strategy, the portfolio allocation
has been significantly changed since the previous accounting period-end.

 • RevPAL (Rent per available lodge night): the average dally rent {excluding VAT) achieved based on total accommodation income divided by the total available number of lodge nights. RevPAL for the period was £186.08 (2018: £180.46).

 The key performance Indicators compare the 52 weeks ended 25 Aprll 2019 to the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018.

 Going concem The Directors have anessed the financlal positions of the Group and the Company based upon the net currant llablllties position at the end of the period. In a8888slng the going concern of the business they have considered the projected future trading and cash flowa of the business. Using the evidence avallable to them they have concluded that It Is appropriate to present the financial statements on a going concern basis, as they consider that the Group wlll continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements.

 Prlnclpal rlak8 and uncertalntlaa The Directors and senior managers adopt a proactive approach to the management of potential risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the performance of the business and execution of Its growth slrategy, and are actively involved In the Group's Risk Committee. In addition to ongoing monitoring, this Risk Committae meets quartarfy to oversee risk management anangements and ensure appropriate processes are put In place to mitigate potential risks and uncertainties. The Fire, Health and Safaty Steering Committee also meets bi­ monthly to oversee operational risks.

 There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the Group's performance and execution of Its growth strategy. These risks include, but are not limited to:

 Operatlona[l ]risk [fa]ctora

 Health snd safety The health, safety and welfare of the Group's guests and employees are central to its operations. The Group Is committed to maintaining Industry leading standards In health and safety lncludlng fire and food safety and adopts a proactive approach to Its safety management All Incidents are recorded and reviewed to monitor trends and capture learning points that are then integrated into the business. The Fire, Health and Safaty Steering Committee reviews major Incidents and Is focused on continuous Improvement to mitigate the risk.

 Business continuity The Group operates five hollday villages In the United Kingdom and a significant Interruption of any one would have a material impact on the Group. As a result, the Risk Committee supervises compnlhensive risk management anangements Including business continuity plans which are regularly testad with the support of external speclalista. These anangements are supported by a broad insurance programme.

 Supply chain The Group has a large number of aupplians and prides Itself on the quality of its product. The Group could be adversely affected by a fall In the standard of goods or services supplied by third parties or by a failure of a key partner. Quallty risks are mitigated via a robust supplier registration system with food and safety further supported by Independent advlsors. In addition, the Risk Committee considers supply chain contingency arrangements and takes appropriate measures to mitigate this risk.

###### Center Pares {Holdings 1) Limited

 Strategic report For the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2019 (continued)

 Prlnclpal risks and uncertainties [(]continued[) ]

**_Contrectual arrangements_**
###### The Group has contracts with third parties for the supply of goods and aervlces. Contracts are negotiated at arms' length and the Group does not enter Into contracts that are outside the ordinary course of bu81n888 or thoae that contain onerous terms. The Group ado[pts ]a compliance [pro]gramme to ensure that It Is compliant with its material contractual commitments. There Is no single contractual counterpa[rty ]that Is criUcal to the running of the busln888. The fallure of any crttlcal contractual counterpa[rty ]Is managed through supply chain contingency arrangements [(]see Supply chain[)].

 Employees The Group's performance largely depends on lta managers and staff, both on the villages and at head office. The reslgnaUon of key lndlvlduals or the lnablllty to recruit staff with the right experience and skllls could adverse[ly ]Impact the Group's results. To mitigate these issues the Group has invested In training programmes for its staff and has a number of bonus schemas linked to the Group's results and achievement against key performance Indicators linked to guest satisfaction that are designed to reward and retain key Individuals.

**_Input price lf1Cf88888_**
###### The Group's margin can be adversely affected by an increase in the price of key costs to the business including, but not limited to, wages, overheads and utilities. The Group takes proaCUve steps to manage any such lncreaHS Including coat control, forward buying and budgeting for any lncn3ase.

**_Brand_**
###### The Center Pares brand could be adverael[y ]affected by a serious incident, accident or slmllar occurrence or [J]ust a slow decline In the brand's appeal to consumers. The Group mitigates the risk of a serious incident, accident or simllar occul18nce by maintaining lndu[stry-]leadlng health and [safety ]ayetems and standards of training. The risk of a slow decline In the brand's appeal Is managed through continuous product Innovation, marketing campaigns and brand develo[p]ment

**_Fraud_**
###### The Group operates five sites across the United Kingdom. Risk of fraud exists In misappropriation of assets, lncludlng banking, theft of stock and theft of cash takings. The Grou[p ]mitigates this risk thro[ug]h the management structure and regular financial review with, and extensive use of, business systems. In addition, the Group's internal audit function undertakes regular reviews of flnanclal controls with particular focus on cash and stock transactions. The Group la also sub[j]ect to regular external audits.

 Market risk factors

**_General Economic conditions_**
###### The dis[posa]ble Income of the Group's guests and/or their hollday preferences are and will be affected by changes In the general economic environment and this may result In a fall In the number of guests and/or a decrease In on-site expenditure. The Group regula[rly ]reviews Its product offering and engages with guests to ensure It provides value for money to meet guest needs.

 Brexlt Followlng the result of the •erexir Referendum on 23 June 2016, there remains a large degree of uncertainty regarding what the legal, economic, polltlcal and trading relatlonshlp will be between the United Kingdom and the member states of the European Union and other sovereign states. Untll the terms of •erextr have bean finalised, it is dlfflcult for businesses to predict the impact it wlll have on them and their flnanclal performance. Thus far, the referendum result has not had a material Impact on the business of the Group.

**_Competition_**
###### The Center Pares brand la synonymous with high quality short breaks In a forest environment but the Group competes for the discretionary expenditure of potential guests, who could choose to take short breaks at other desUnatlons or participate In other recreational actlvlUes. The Dlrectora balleve that this risk is mitigated by the strength of the Center Pares brand and the continual Investment In the accommodation and central facllltles (lncludlng retall and restaurants), coupled with the innovation amongst the leisure activities and the responsiveness to guest surveys.

 Strategic report For the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2019 (continued)

 Prtnclpal rtea and uncertalntl•• (continued)

**_Seaaonallty and weather_**
###### Demand for ehort breaks Is Influenced by the main hofiday periods at Entar, the Summer holidays and the ChrtstmaafNew year pertod. Thie rtek is mitigated by online dynamic prtclng which encourages demand outalde of the peak periods. The accommodation Is located within forest environments and a significant number of activities take place outdoors. Therefore, demand may be lmpactsd by the prevailing weather. This risk Is minimal becauae guests tend not to book on lmpulaa and the vast majortty of breaks and activities are booked in advance. Additionally, the Group maintains diversity between lta Indoor and outdoor activities to mitigate this rtak.

 Ananclaj risks The Directors and senior managers regularty review the flnanclal requirements of the Group and the 8880clated risks. The Group does not uaa complicated financial Instruments and where tlnancial Instruments are used they are used to reduce Interest rate risk. The Group does not hold tlnancial lnstn.ments for trading purposaa. The Group finances Its operations and developments through a mixture of retained eamlnga and borrowings as required. Hlatorlcally, the Group has sought to reduce Its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Group funding using the undertylng asNt value.

 All tranches of the Group's secured debt are subject to financial covenants. The Directors have asseued future compllance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial covenants.

**_Interest rate risk_**
###### Principal aources of borrowings are fixed Interest rate loan notes.

_LJquldlty risk_
###### The Group maintains sufficient levels of cash to enable It to meet Its medium-term working capital, lease llability and funding obllgations. Rolling forecasts of 1/quidlty requirements are prepared and monitored, and surplue cash le
**Invested In lntereet heart� accounts.**

**_Currency rillk_**
###### Whilst no borrowings are denominated In foreign cun8ncies, a number of suppliers are exposed to the Euro and US Dollar. Acconlngly, wherever poalble the Group enters Into supply contracts denominated In Sterling. The Group does not operate a hedging faclfity to manage cun8ncy rfsk as it Is not considered to be material.

**_Credit risk_**
###### The Group's caeh balances are held on deposit with a number of UK banking Institutions. Credit risk In respect of the Group'• revenue streams la limited ea the vast majority of customers pay In advance.

 Flnanc/81 reporting risk The Group's financial systems are required to proce11 a large number of transactions securely and accurately; any weaknesses In the systems could result In the incorrect reporting of financial results and covenant compliance. This risk Is mitigated by the production of detailed management accounts which are regularly compered to budgets and forecasts. The Group 18 also subject to an annual external audit

**registered In England and Wales. The address of its registered office Is One Edleon Rise, New Ollerton, Newark,**
**Nottinghamshire, NG22 90P.**

**Bal• of preparation**
**These consolidated flnanclal statements for the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2019 (2018: 53 weeks ended 26 Aprll 2018)**
**have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and lntamatlonal Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee**
**(IFRIC) and Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) Interpretations adopted by the European Union and wtth thoee**
**parts of the Companies Act 2006 appllcable to companies reporting under IFRS. The flnanclal statements have bean**
**prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments and**
**retirement benefit obligations. All accounting policlas disclosed have been applied conslatently** to **both periods**
**presented, with the exception of those relating to flnanclal Instruments, revenue and lease accounting following the**
**adoption of IFRS 9 'Flnanclal Instruments', IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' and IFRS 18 'Leases'**
**in the period anded 25 April 2019.**

**Toe accounting reference date of Canter Paree (Holdlngs 1) Limited Is 22 April.**

**Genera/ impact of the application of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'**
**The adoption of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', replacing IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and**
**Measurement', has not had a material Impact on the Group'& financial statements. There have been no changes to**
**the aneta and llablilHes considered to be ftnanclal Instruments, although IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' d088 amend**
**the categorisation of financial assets and liabilities. This change has been reflected In both the flnanclal instruments**
**accounting policy and the disclosures in note 17.**

**IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' Introduces an expacted credit loss modal which requires the Group to consider the**
**recoverability of its financial assets and** to recognise any anticipated losses as an Impairment. In 188pect of trade
**racelvablas, credit risk is limited as the vast majority of customers pay In advance. Credit risk la also considered to**
**be low In respect of the Group's cash and cash equivalents, given the credit ratings of the counterpertias. As such,**
**no expected credit 108888 have bean recognised following the adoption of IFRS 9 'Flnanclal Instruments'.**

**IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' also Introduces new requirements for hedge accounting but thasa are not currently**
**relevant to the Group.**

**Addltlonally, the Group has adopted consequentlal amendments to IAS 7 'Statement of Cash Flows' that have been**
**applied to the current and prior period.**

**_General Impact of the application of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'_**
**The adoption of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers', replacing IAS 18 'Revenue', has not had a**
**material impact on the Group's financial statements. The Group has adopted IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with**
**Customers' using the retrospective method (without pradlcal expedients) and as such has recognised the cumulative**

###### Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weak.a ended 25 Aprll 2019 (continued)

 1. Accounting policies (continued)

 Genera/ impact of the appllcatlon of IFRS 16 'Leases' In the current period, the Group, for the first time, has applied IFRS 16 'Leases' (as Issued by the IASB In January 2016) in advance of Its effective date.

 IFRS 16 'Leases' introduces new or amended requirements with respect to lease accounting. It Introduces significant changes to lesaee accounting by removing the distinction between operating and finance leases and requiring the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liablllty at the lease commencement date for all leases, except for short-tann leases and 188888 of low value assets.

 The Group has applied IFRS 16 'Leases' using the modified retrospective approach and therefore the comparative lnfonnation has not bean restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 'Leases'. The details of accounting under IAS 17 'Leases' are disclosed separately and the Impact of the changes Is dlscloaed In note 2.

 Impact of the new definition of s lease The Group has made use of the practical expedient available on transition to IFRS 18 'Leases' not to reassess whether a contract Is or contains a lease. Accordingly, the definition of a lease In accordance with IAS 17 'Leases' and IFRIC 4 'Determining Whether An Agreement Contains a Lease' wlll continue to be applied to leases entered Into or modified before 27 April 2018.

 The change in definition of a lease principally relates to the concept of control. IFRS 18 'Leases' detennines whether a contract contains a lease on the basis of whether the customer has the right to control the use of an Identified asset for a period of time In exchange for consideration.

 The Group applies the definition of a lease and relatad related guidance set out in IFRS 18 'Leases' to all lease contracts entered into or modified on or after 27 April 2018. In preparation for the first-time adoption of IFRS 16 'Leases' the Group carried out an implementation project which showed that the new definition In IFRS 18 'Leases' wlll not significantly change the scope of contracts that meet the definlUon of a lease for the Group.

 Impact on L88SH Accounting IFRS 18 'Leases' changes how the Group accounts for leases previously classlfled as operating leases under IAS 17 'Leases', which were off-balance sheet. Applying IFRS 18 'Leases' the Group:
 a) Recognises right-of-use aaets and lease liabllltles In the consolidated balance sheet. lnltlally measured at the present value of future lease payments; b) Recognises depreciation of right-to-use assets and interest on lease llabllltles In the consolldated Income statement; and c) Separates the total amount of cash paid into a principal portion and Interest In the consolidated cash flow statement (both presented within financing activities).

 Under IFRS 18 'Leases', right-of-use a88eta ara tested for impalnnent in accordance with IAS36 'Impairment of Assets'. This replaces the previous requirement to recognise a provision for onerous leaaa contracts. For short-tenn leaaas (lease tenns of 12 months or lass) and leases of low-value a888ts, the Group has opted to recognise a lease expense on a straight-fine basis as permitted by IFRS 16 'Leases'.

 Going concern The Directors have asaeased the financial positions of the Group and the Company In llght of the net current llabllitiea positions at the end of the period. In aaaeaalng the going concern of the buslneaa they have considered the projected Mure trading and cash flows of the business. Using the evidence available to them they have concluded that It Is appropriate to present the financlal statements on a going concern basis, as they consider that the Group wlll continua as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the flnanclal statements.

###### The consolidated financial statements incorporete the financial statements of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited fthe Company') and entitles controlled by the Company. A company controls another entity when It Is exposed, or has rights, to varlable returns from Its Involvement with that entity and has the ablllty to affect those returns through Its power over that entity.

 The consolldated financial statements Incorporate the rasults of CPUK Finance Limited, a company set up with the sole purpose of IBSulng debt aecured on assets owned by the Group. The Dlrecto111 of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited consider this company meets the definition of a structured entity under IFRS 10 'Consolldated financial atatements' and hence for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements it has bean treated as a subsidiary undertaking. Details of this company are provided in note 28.

 The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared for the same flnanclal reporting period as the Company.

 The consolidated flnanclal statements of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited have been prepared under the prlnciplas of predaC8880r accounting and all entitles are Included at their pre-combination canylng amounts. This accounting treatment results In differences on consolidation between consideration and the fair value of underlying net assets and this difference is included within equity as an other reserve.

 On 11 June 2015 the Group acquired CP Wobum (Operating Company) Limited; prior to that data both the Group and CP Wobum (Operating Company) Limited were under the common control of the paT9nt company CP Cayman Mldco 1 Limited. The acquisition formed part of a group reconstruction and has been accounted for using merger accounUng prlnclples which preaent the flnanclal statements as If CP Wobum (Operating Company) Limited had always bean part of the Group using the pre-combination canylng values.

 Under merger accounting prlnclplas, the assets and llablllUas of CP Wobum (Operating Company) Limited have bean consolldatad based on their pre-combination book values and the difference between the consideration payable and the book values of the net assets Is recorded In equity In the other reserve.

**Critical accounting Judgements and key aoul'C88 of e1tlmatlon uncertainty**
**The preparation of financial statements requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affact the**
**applicatlon of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on**
**hlatorical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable**
**under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.**

**Crltlcal j[ud]gements [in ]applyjnq the Group's accountjng pollcies**

###### Discount rate used to determine the carrying value of the Group's defined benem pension scheme obligation:
**The Group's defined benefit pension scheme obligation is discounted at a rate set by reference to market ylelds at**
**the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Significant Judgment Is required when setting the**
**criteria for bonds to be Included In the populatlon from which the yleld curve Is derived.**

**Key sources of estjmallon uncertainty**

###### Useful economic llvN and residual values of property, plant and equipment and other Intangible assets:
**The Group reviews the estimated useful llves of property, plant and equipment and other lntanglble assets at the end**
**of each reporting period. During the currant period, the Directors have concluded that no revision Is required to either**
**useful economic fives or residual values of th898 a888ts.**

###### Impairment test for goodwill:
**Determining whether goodwill Is Impaired requires an estimation of the value In use of the cash-generating units to**
**which goodwlll has been allocated. The value In use calculation requires the Group to estimate future cash flows**
**expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.**

###### Determination of the appropriate rate to discount /ease payments:
**Where discount rates lmpllclt in leases cannot be readily determined, the Group Is required to calculate appropriate**
**Incremental borrowing rates in order to establlsh the values of lease llabllities and associated right-of-use asse1B.**
**This process Incorporates a number of estimates and assumptions, lncludlng property ylelds and borrowing rates.**

**Revenue**
**Revenue relates to accommodation rental Income on holldays commenced during the period, together with other**
**related Income that primarily arises from on-village lelsure, retail and food and beverage spend. Revenue relating to**
**accommodation Is recognised on a stralght-llne basis over the period of the holiday. The perfonnance obllgatlon for**
**non-rental Income, and hence the basis for revenue recognition, is when the related produd or service is provided to**
**the guest. All revenue Is recorded net of VAT.**

**Payment for accommodation rental Income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and Is recorded as**
**'deferred Income' within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences. A number of trading units on each**
**holiday village are operated by conceBSlon partnen1. Revenue due in reaped of such units Is recognised on an**
**accruals basis. All revenue arises In the United Kingdom.**

**For disaggregation purposes, revenue as presented In note 3 Is spilt between accommodation and on-afte spend.**

**Coat of NIN**
**Cost of sales comprise the cost of goods and services provided to guests. All costs to the point of sale, includlng**

**Goodwlll**
###### Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and llabllities acquired. Goodwill ls not amortised but is Instead tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently If events or changes In circumstances Indicate that the carrying value may be Impaired. Any Impairment Is recognised lmmedletaly In the Income statement. Goodwlll Is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.

other lntanglble alet:I
###### Software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are generally considered to be either four or seven years.

 Costs that are dlrectly aSS0clated with the production of ldentlflable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as Intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assats are amortised over their estimated useful lives.

**_Other Intangible assets_**
###### Other purchased Intangible assets are capltallsed at cost, amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives and tested for Impairment annually. The brand Is not amortised as It Is considered to have an Indefinite life; the carrying value of the brand is subject to an annual impairment review.

 Impairment of aaeta Assets that have an Indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for Impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for Impairment whenever events or changes In circumstances Indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An Impairment loss Is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds Its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an assefs fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately ldentlflable cash flows {cash-generating units).

 Property, plant and equipment The Directors chose the cost basis under IAS 16 'Property, plant and equipment', rather than to apply the alternative {revaluation) treatment to all Items of property, plant and equipment as Its ongoing accounting policy. The cost of property, plant and equipment Includes directly attributable costs. The Group elected to apply the optional exemption of IFRS 1 'First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards' and, as such, the carrying value of properties that were previously held at fair value was treated as deemed cost at the date of adoption of IFRS.

 Depreciation Is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment (except assets In the course of construction) so as to write off the cost, 1888 residual value, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned, which are typically as follows:

 Installations 1 O to 20 years Fixturea and fittings 5 to 10 years Motor vehicles 4years Computer hardware 4years

 Buildings are depreciated to reaidual value over 50 years. Land is not depreciated. The Group's water boreholes are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 13 years.

 Useful llves and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and revised where expectations are slgnlflcantly dlfrarent from previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for current and future periods Is adjusted accordingly.

 Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get reedy for their Intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their Intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised In the Income statement In the year In which they are Incurred.

**Maintenance expendltul"B**
###### It is the pollcy of the Group to maintain Its land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance expenditure Increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment la expected to generate, this expenditure is capitalised. All other maintenance coats are charged to the Income statement as Incurred.

**_Polley appllcable from 27 April 2018_**
###### The Group asaesaea whether a contract la or contains a lease at Inception of a contract. The Group recognl888 a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease llabllity with respect to all lease agreements in which it Is the lessee, except for short-tenn leases (defined as leases with a lease tenn of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the tenn of the lease unless another systematic basis Is more representative of the time pattern In which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

 The lease llablllty Is lnltlally measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate lmpliclt In the lease. If this rate cannot be readily detennlned, the Group calculates an appropriate Incremental borrowing rate.

 Lease payments Included In the measurement of the lease llablllty comprise:

 • Fixed lease payments (including In-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives;
 • Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, lnltlally measured using the Index or rate at the commencement date;
 • The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;
 • The exercise price of purchase options, If the lessee Is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and
 • Payments of penalties for tenninatlng the lease, If the lease tenn reflects the exercise of an option to tennlnate the lease.

 Lease llablfltles are subsequently measured by Increasing the carrying amount to reflect Interest on the lease llabHlties (using the effective interest rate method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. The Group reme88llres the lease liabilities {and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use assets) whenever:
 • The lease term has changed or there Is a change In the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, In which case the lease liablllty la remeasured by dlacounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.
 • The lease payments change due to changes In an Index or rate or a change In expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, In which cases the lease llability Is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the Initial discount rate (unless the leaae payments change la due to a change in a floating Interest rate, In which case a revised discount rate is used).
 • A lease contract Is modified and the lease modification Is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which caae the lease llabllity Is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

 The right-of-use assets comprise the lnltlal measurement of the corresponding lease llabillty, lease payments made at or before the commencement date and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and lmpalnnent losses.

 Whenever the Group Incurs an obllgaUon for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset. restore the site on which It Is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the tenna and conditions of the lease, a provision la recognised and measured under IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'. The costs are Included In the related right-of-use asset.

 Rlght-of-uee assets are depreciated over the shorter period of leaae tenn and ueeful llfe of the underlying asset. If a lease transfera ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset Is depreciated over the useful llfe of the underlying asset. The deprecation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

 Variable rents that do not depend on an Index or rate are not Included In the measurement of the lease llablHty and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognised as an administrative expense in the conaolldated income statement In the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.

 Assets held under finance leases were capltallaecl at cost and depreciated over their useful llves. The capital element of future rentals was treated as a liability and the interest element was charged to the Income statement over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital outstanding.

 Rental payments on operating leases (net of any Incentives received from the l8880r and lncludlng minimum contractual rental Increases) were charged to the Income statement on a straight-line basis.

###### Investments are stated at cost, 1888 any provision for pennanent diminution In value. If there are Indications of lmpalnnent, an asaeument Is made of the recoverable amounl An impairment loss is recognlaecl In the Income statement when the recoverable amount Is lower than the canylng value. Dividends receivable from Investments In subsidiary undertakings are recognised in the income statement when approved by the shareholders of the company paying the dividend.

 Current and deferred tax The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enactad or substantlvely enacted at the balance sheet date and le measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorttles.

 Deferred tax Is provided In full, using the llablllty method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax In the Mure. Differences are defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and llabllltles and their tax baae. Such asaets and llabllltles are not recognised If the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the lnlllal recognition (other than In a busln888 combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profll Deferred tax on properties a88umes recovery through sale.

 Deferred tax assets are recogniaecl to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits wlll be available against which the 888ets can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset Is reallsed or the deferred tax llablllty Is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantlvely enacted at the balance sheet date.

 Deferred tax assets and liabilitles are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and current tax llabllltles and when the deferred Income 1axes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an Intention to settle on a net basis.

Net realisable value Is the estimated selling price In the ordinary course of business 1888 appllcable variable selling expenses. Inventory provisions are created where nece88ary to ensure that Inventory Is valued at the lower of cost and estimated net reallsable value.

 Flnanclal Instruments The Group classifies Its flnanclal assets Into two categories, being those measured at amortlaecl cost and those measured at fair value. Where assets are measured at fair value gains and losses are recognised either In the income statement or In other comprehensive Income, depending on the nature of the asset. Flnanclal assets are Included In current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets

 Flnanclal llabllltles are classified as either fair velue through profit and loss or other financial llabllllles. The classiflcation depends on the nature of the financial Instrument acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial Instruments at lnltlal recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each reporting date. Other flnanclal llabllltles are canted at amortlaecl cost using the effective Interest rate method.

operates five holiday villages in the United Kingdom, at Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, Elveden Forest in
Suffolk, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Whinfell Forest in Cumbria and Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire.

Center Pares targets the premium sector of the UK family short break market, offering an escape from the stresses
and strains of modem life and helping families come together.

With recent trends showing an increase in family short breaks, particularly in the UK, the Center Pares concept is
more relevant today than at any point in its history in the UK market. Center Pares continually invests heavily to
ensure that we deliver high quality service, accommodation and facilities, combined with an unrivalled array of
activities that cater for the most discerning of families, as well as the most changeable of British weather. There is
nothing prescriptive about a short break at Center Pares, with each family free to choose to do as little or as much as
they wish. Center Pares remains a unique proposition for families in the UK market and proves more popular every
year with a long-standing run of growth in terms of visitor numbers, revenue and EBITDA, as well as enviable guest
feedback scores and consistently high levels of returning guests.

Each of the Group's holiday villages is set in a forest environment amongst approximately 400 acres of forest and
lakes and is open 365 days per year. Woodland, water and a natural environment are the essential elements of a
Center Pares break. Within the comfortable, quiet and family-friendly setting, the Center Pares villages provide
guests with high-quality accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. There are over 4,200 units of
accommodation across the five villages. The focal point and key attraction of each village is an all-weather indoor
sub-tropical swimming paradise, featuring a selection of water activities including a wave pool, river slides and rides,
children's pools and jacuzzis. Other on-site experiences include outdoor activities such as cycling, boating and
quadbikes; indoor activities such as ten-pin bowling, badminton ana pottery; anu leisure amenities such as spas,
dining and retail.

_Financial performance_

The results of the Group for the period show a profit after taxation of £51.5 million (2017: profit of £63.8 million).
Adjusted EBITDA, being earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional/non-underlying
items was £228.4 million (2017: £213.0 million).

The heavy snowfall in England in March 2018 caused the temporary closure of Longleat Forest and restricted guest
arrivals and activities at all other villages. Guests impacted by the snow were issued refunds of both their
accommodation and on-site spend. This was only the fourth time that a village has had to close in over 30 years of
trading. The Directors estimate that the lost revenue totalled £1.6 million and the overall reduction in EBITDA for the
53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 was approximately £1.5 million. As such, had the heavy snowfall not occurred,
Adjusted EBITDA would have been £229.9 million.

During the period the Group incurred an exceptional/non-underlying finance cost of £26.9 million in respect of a
refinancing of the Group's debt. The Group also incurred exceptional/non-underlying administrative expenses of £2.3
million (2017: £nil), representing £1.6 million of costs relating to legal claims and associated settlements and £0.7
million of _one-off restructuring and reorganisation costs. Taxation on these expenses has also been treated as an_
exceptional/non-underlying item, as has a credit of £1.9 million in respect of a one-off group relief adjustment.

On 15 June 2017 the Group issued £100.0 million of additional A4 secured notes, together with £730.0 million of New
Class B notes, divided into £480.0 million 4.250% notes due to expire in August 2022 and £250.0 million 4.875%
notes due to mature in August 2025. Part of the proceeds of these new notes were used to settle the Group's Class
82 notes, which were due to mature in August 2020.

During the prior period ending 20 April 2017, the Group incurred an exceptional/non-underlying finance expense of
£5.2 million in respect of the anticipated refinancing of the Group's debt. Taxation on this expense was also treated
as an exceptional/non-underlying item, as was the impact of the change in applicable deferred tax rate from 18% to
17%.

 Strategic report For the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)

**Key performance indicators**
The Directors use the following key performance indicators to set targets and measure performance:

          - Revenue: Revenue for the period was £469.0 million (2017: £440.3 million).

          - Adjusted EBITDA: Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional/non­
underlying items. Adjusted EBITDA for the period was £228.4 million (2017: £213.0 million).

          - Occupancy: the average number of units of accommodation occupied as a percentage of the total number
available. Occupancy for the period was 97.6% (2017: 97.3%).

          - ADR (Average Daily Rate): the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total accommodation
income divided by the total number of lodge nights sold. ADR for the period was £184.95 (2017: £178.60).

          - RevPAL (Rent per available lodge night): the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total
accommodation income divided by the total available number of lodge nights. RevPAL for the period was
£180.46 (2017: £173.80).

**Going concern**
The Directors have assessed the financial positions of the Group and the Company based upon the net current
liabilities positions at the end of the period. In assessing the going concern of the business they have considered the
projected future trading and cash flows of the business. Using the evidence available to them they have concluded
that it is appropriate to present the financial statements on a going concern basis, as they consider that the Group will
continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements.

Principal **risks and uncertainties**
The Directors and senior managers adopt a proactive approach to the management of potential risks and
uncertainties which could have a material impact on the performance of the business and execution of its growth
strategy, and are actively involved in the Group's Risk Committee. In addition to ongoing monitoring, this Risk
Committee meets quarterly to oversee risk management arrangements and ensure appropriate processes are put in
place to mitigate potential risks and uncertainties. The Fire, Health and Safety Steering Committee also meets bi­
monthly to oversee operational risks.

There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the Group's
performance and execution of its growth strategy. These risks include, but are not limited to:

Operational risk factors

_Health and safety_
The health, safety and welfare of the Group's guests and employees are central to its operations. The Group is
committed to maintaining industry leading standards in health and safety including fire and food safety and adopts a
proactive approach to its safety management. All incidents are recorded and reviewed to monitor trends and capture
learning points that are then integrated into the business. The Fire, Health and Safety Steering Committee reviews
major incidents and is focused on continuous improvement to mitigate the risk.

_Business continuity_
The Group operates five holiday villages in the United Kingdom and a significant interruption of any one would have a
material impact on the Group. As a result, the Risk Committee supervises comprehensive risk management
arrangements including business continuity plans which are regularly tested with the support of external specialists.
These arrangements are supported by a broad insurance programme.

_Supply chain_
The Group has a large number of suppliers and prides itself on the quality of its product. The Group could be
adversely affected by a fall in the standard of goods or services supplied by third parties or by a failure of a key
partner. Quality risks are mitigated via a robust supplier registration system with food and safety further supported by
independent advisors. In addition, the Risk Committee considers supply chain contingency arrangements and takes
appropriate measures to mitigate this risk.


-----

###### Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited

 Strategic report For the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)

**Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)**

_Contractual arrangements_
The Group has contracts with third parties for the supply of goods and services. Contracts are negotiated at arms'
length and the Group does not enter into contracts that are outside the ordinary course of business or those that
contain onerous terms. The Group adopts a compliance programme to ensure that it is compliant with its material
contractual commitments. There is no single contractual counterparty that is critical to the running of the business.
The failure of any critical contractual counterparty is managed through supply chain contingency arrangements (see
Supply chain).

_Employees_
The Group's performance largely depends on its managers and staff, both on the villages and at head office. The
resignation of key individuals or the inability to recruit staff with the right experience and skills could adversely impact
the Group's results. To mitigate these issues the Group has invested in training programmes for its staff and has a
number of bonus schemes linked to the Group's results and achievement against key performance indicators linked
to guest satisfaction that are designed to reward and retain key individuals.

_Input price increases_
The Group's margin can be adversely affected by an increase in the price of key costs to the business including, but
not limited to, wages, overheads and utilities. The Group takes proactive steps to manage any such increases
including cost control, forward buying and budgeting for any increase.

_Brand_
The Center Pares brand could be adversely affected by a serious incident, accident or similar occurrence or just a
slow decline in the brand's appeal to consumers. The Group mitigates the risk of a serious incident, accident or
similar occurrence by maintaining industry-leading health and safety systems and standards of training. The risk of a
slow decline in the brand's appeal is managed through continuous product innovation, marketing campaigns and
brand development.

_Fraud_
The Group operates five sites across the United Kingdom. Risk of fraud exists in misappropriation of assets,
including banking, theft of stock and theft of cash takings. The Group mitigates this risk through the management
structure and regular financial review with, and extensive use of, business systems. In addition, the Group's internal
audit function undertakes regular reviews of financial controls with particular focus on cash and stock transactions.
The Group is also subject to regular external audits.

Market risk factors

_General Economic conditions_
The disposable income of the Group's guests and/or their holiday preferences are and will be affected by changes in
the general economic environment and this may result in a fall in the number of guests and/or a decrease in on-site
expenditure. The Group regularly reviews its product offering and engages with guests to ensure it provides value for
money to meet guest needs.

_Brexit_
Following the result of the "Brexit" Referendum on 23 June 2016, there remains a large degree of uncertainty
regarding what the legal, economic, political and trading relationship will be between the United Kingdom and the
member states of the European Union and other sovereign states. Until the terms of "Brexit" have been finalised, it is
difficult for businesses to predict the impact it will have on them and their financial performance. Thus far, the
referendum result has not had a material impact on the business of the Group.

_Competition_
The Center Pares brand is synonymous with high quality short breaks in a forest environment but the Group
competes for the discretionary expenditure of potential guests, who could choose to take short breaks at other
destinations or participate in other recreational activities. The Directors believe that this risk is mitigated by the
strength of the Center Pares brand and the continual investment in the accommodation and central facilities
(including retail and restaurants), coupled with the innovation amongst the leisure activities and the responsiveness
to guest surveys.


-----

###### Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited

 Strategic report For the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)

**Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)**

_Seasonality and weather_
Demand for short breaks is influenced by the main holiday periods at Easter, the Summer holidays and the
Christmas/New year period. This risk is mitigated by online dynamic pricing which encourages demand outside of
the peak periods. The accommodation is located within forest environments and a significant number of activities
take place outdoors. Therefore, demand may be impacted by the prevailing weather. This risk is minimal because
guests tend not to book on impulse and the vast majority of breaks and activities are booked in advance.
Additionally, the Group maintains diversity between its indoor and outdoor activities to mitigate this risk.

Financial risks
The Directors and senior managers regularly review the financial requirements of the Group and the associated risks.
The Group does not use complicated financial instruments and where financial instruments are used they are used to
reduce interest rate risk. The Group does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. The Group finances its
operations and developments through a mixture of retained earnings and borrowings as required. Historically, the
Group has sought to reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Group funding using the underlying
asset value.

All tranches of the Group's secured debt are subject to financial covenants. The Directors have assessed future
compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial covenants.

_Interest rate risk_
Principal sources of borrowings are fixed interest rate loan notes.

_Liquidity risk_
The Group maintains sufficient levels of cash to enable it to meet its medium-term working capital and debt service
obligations. Rolling forecasts of liquidity requirements are prepared and monitored, and surplus cash is invested in
interest bearing accounts.

_Currency risk_
Whilst no borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies, a number of suppliers are exposed to the Euro and US
Dollar. Accordingly, wherever possible the Group enters into supply contracts denominated in Sterling. The Group
does not operate a hedging facility to manage currency risk as it is not considered to be material.

_Credit risk_
The Group's cash balances are held on deposit with a number of UK banking institutions. Credit risk in respect of the
Group's revenue streams is limited as the vast majority of customers pay in advance.

_Financial reporting risk_
The Group's financial systems are required to process a large number of transactions securely and accurately; any
weaknesses in the systems could result in the incorrect reporting of financial results and covenant compliance. This
risk is mitigated by the production of detailed management accounts which are regularly compared to budgets and
forecasts. The Group is also subject to an annual external audit.

expected to open in late Summer 2019. Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited and Center Pares Ireland Limited have
the same ultimate parent company.

**Dividends**

employer and values diversity among its employees. These commitments extend to recruitment and selection,
training, career development, flexible working arrangements, promotion and performance appraisal.

_Disabled employees_
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the
applicant concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled every _effort_ is made to ensure that their
employment with the Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the
training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of
other employees.

_Employee consultation_
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and has continued to keep them informed
on matters affecting them as employees and on the various factors affecting the performance of the Group. This is
principally achieved through formal and informal briefings, the quarterly internal Group magazine 'Center Forward'
and annual presentations of the financial results by the CEO. Employee representatives are consulted regularly on a
wide range of matters affecting their current and future interests, via village and head office council meetings which
take place four times a year. In addition, all employees with more than six months' service receive an annual bonus
related to the overall profitability of the Group.

**Political donations**
No political donations were made in the current or prior period.

 Directors' report For the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)

**Directors' Responsibilities Statement**
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic report, the Directors' report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period. Under that law the
Directors have prepared the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards {IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial
statements, the Directors are required to:

        - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

        - make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

        - state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been followed; and

        - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group
and Company will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Group's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

**Statement of disclosure of information to the auditor**
In accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, in the case of each Director in office at the date the
Directors' report is approved, the following applies:

a) so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group's auditor is
unaware; and
b) he/she has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make him/herself aware
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group's auditor is aware of that information.

**Independent auditor**
Deloitte LLP are deemed to be reappointed under section 487 (2) of the Companies Act 2006.

 Independent auditor's report to the members of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited

**Report on the audit of the financial statements**

**Opinion**

In our opinion:

          - the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the Parent Company's
affairs as at 26 April 2018 and of the Group's profit for the 53 weeks then ended;

          - the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union;

          - the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act
2006;and

          - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006.

We have audited the financial statements of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited for the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018
which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group and
Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Group and Parent Company Statements of
Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 27. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European
Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act 2006.

**Basis for opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs(UK)) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's
Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following matters where:

          - the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of the financial statements is not
appropriate; or

          - the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may
cast significant doubt about the Group's or Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting for a period of at least 12 months from the date when the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

**Other information**
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in
the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to
report that fact.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

 Independent auditor's report to the members of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited (continued)

**Responsibilities of Directors**
As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as
the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent
Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.orq.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's
report.

**Use of our report**
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

**Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

          - the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors' report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

          - the Strategic report and the Directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the Parent Company and their environment
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic report or the
Directors' report.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report in respect of the following matters if, in our opinion:

          - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit

have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

          - the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

          - certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

          - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

###### Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited --====�==============:::;::::======;:::::i
 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018**

###### 1. Accounting policies

**General information**
The Company is a private company limited by shares, which is incorporated and domiciled in the UK, and is
registered in England and Wales. The address of its registered office is One Edison Rise, New Ollerton, Newark,
Nottinghamshire, NG22 9DP.

**Basis of preparation**
These consolidated financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (2017: 52 weeks ended 20 April 2017)
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC) and Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) interpretations adopted by the European Union and with those
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments and
retirement benefit obligations. All accounting policies disclosed have been applied consistently to both periods
presented.

The accounting reference date of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited is 22 April.

**Going concern**
The Directors have assessed the financial positions of the Group and the Company in light of the net current liabilities
positions at the end of the period. In assessing the going concern of the business they have considered the
projected future trading and cash flows of the business. Using the evidence available to them they have concluded
that it is appropriate to present the financial statements on a going concern basis, as they consider that the Group will
continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements.

**Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited ('the
Company') and entities controlled by the Company. A company controls another entity when it is exposed, or has
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with that entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over that entity.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of CPUK Finance Limited, a company set up with the
sole purpose of issuing debt secured on assets owned by the Group. The Directors of Center Pares (Holdings 1)
Limited consider this company meets the definition of a structured entity under IFRS 10 'Consolidated financial
statements' and hence for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements it has been treated as a subsidiary
undertaking. Details of this company are provided in note 26.

The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared for the same financial reporting period as the
Company.

The consolidated financial statements of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited have been prepared under the principles
of predecessor accounting and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts. This accounting
treatment results in differences on consolidation between consideration and the fair value of underlying net assets
and this difference is included within equity as an other reserve.

On 11 June 2015 the Group acquired CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited; prior to that date both the Group
and CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited were under the common control of the parent company CP Cayman
Midco 1 Limited. The acquisition formed part of a group reconstruction and has been accounted for using merger
accounting principles which present the financial statements as if CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited had
always been part of the Group using the pre-combination carrying values.

Under merger accounting principles, the assets and liabilities of CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited have been
consolidated based on their pre-combination book values and the difference between the consideration payable and
the book values of the net assets is recorded in equity in the other reserve.

 Notes to the financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)

 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**
The preparation of financial statements requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Critical judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies

_Discount rate used to detennine the carrying value of the Group's defined benefit pension scheme obligation:_
The Group's defined benefit pension scheme obligation is discounted at a rate set by reference to market yields at
the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Significant judgment is required when setting the
criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

_Useful economic lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets:_
The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets at the end
of each reporting period. During the current period, the Directors have concluded that no revision is required to either
useful economic lives or residual values of these assets.

_Impairment test for goodwill:_
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to
which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate future cash flows
expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.

**Revenue**
Revenue relates to accommodation rental income on holidays commenced during the period, together with other
related income that primarily arises from on-village leisure, retail and food and beverage spend. Revenue relating to
accommodation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the holiday. Non-rental income is recognised
when the related product or service is provided to the guest. All revenue is recorded net of VAT.

Payment for accommodation rental income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded as
'payments on account' within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences. A number of trading units on
each holiday village are operated by concession partners. Revenue due in respect of such units is recognised on an
accruals basis. All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.

**Cost of sales**
Cost of sales comprise the cost of goods and services provided to guests. All costs to the point of sale, including
direct employee costs, are included within cost of sales.

**Operating segments**
The operating segments set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements are consistent with the internal
reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 'Operating Segments'. The Chief
Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.

**Exceptional/non-underlying items**
Exceptional/non-underlying items are defined as those that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency,
warrant separate disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the
Group. Non-underlying items are those that are not directly related to the ongoing trade of the business or that are
unrepresentative of ongoing performance. Examples of exceptional/non-underlying items are the costs of Group
restructures, expenses incurred when refinancing the Group's debt and movements in the fair value of embedded
derivatives.

**Goodwill**
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is instead tested
for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is allocated to
cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)**

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Other intangible assets**
_Software_
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the
specific software. These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are
generally considered to be either four or seven years.

Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the
Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as
intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of
relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated
useful lives.

_Other intangible assets_
Other purchased intangible assets are capitalised at cost, amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful
economic lives and tested for impairment annually.

The brand is not amortised as it is considered to have an indefinite life; the carrying value of the brand is subject to
an annual impairment review.

**Impairment of assets**
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which
the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair
value less costs to sell and value-in-use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows { cash-generating units).

**Property, plant and equipment**
Management chose the cost basis under IAS 16 'Property, plant and equipment', rather than to apply the alternative
{revaluation) treatment to all items of property, plant and equipment as its ongoing accounting policy. The cost of
property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable costs. The Group elected to apply the optional exemption
of IFRS 1 'First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards' and, as such, the carrying value of
properties that were previously held at fair value was treated as deemed cost at the date of adoption of IFRS.

Depreciation is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment (except assets in the course of construction)
so as to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the
assets concerned, which are typically as follows:

Installations 10 to 20 years
Fixtures and fittings 5 to 10 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Computer hardware 4 years

Buildings are depreciated to residual value over 50 years. Land is not depreciated. The Group's water boreholes are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over 13 years.

Useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and revised where expectations are
significantly different from previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for current and future periods
is adjusted accordingly.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the
cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other
borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the year in which they are incurred.

**Maintenance expenditure**
It is the policy of the Group to maintain its land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance expenditure
increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to generate, this expenditure is capitalised. All
other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)**

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Leases**
Leases are classified as finance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at cost and depreciated over their useful lives. The capital element
of future rentals is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged to the income statement over the period of
the lease in proportion to the capital outstanding.

Rental payments on operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor and including minimum
contractual rental increases) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.

**Investments in subsidiary undertakings**
Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for permanent diminution in value. If there are indications of
impairment, an assessment is made of the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income
statement when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. Dividends receivable from investments in
subsidiary undertakings are recognised in the income statement when approved by the shareholders of the company
paying the dividend.

**Current and deferred tax**
The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed by
the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are defined
as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Such assets and liabilities
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither
the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax on properties assumes recovery through sale.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or
the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Inventories**
The basis of valuation of inventories is the lower of cost on a first in first out basis and estimated net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable selling
expenses. Inventory provisions are created where necessary to ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of cost
and estimated net realisable value.

**Financial instruments**
The Group classifies its financial assets into two categories, being fair value through profit and loss, and loans and
receivables. Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial liabilities.
The classification depends on the nature of the financial instrument acquired. Management determines the
classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each reporting date.
Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Loans and receivables**
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade
and other receivables in the balance sheet.

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)**

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Investments**
The cost of investments, including loans to related parties, is their purchase cost together with any incremental costs
of acquisition. The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In deciding whether an impairment is required, the Directors consider
the underlying value inherent in the investment. Provision is made against the cost of investments where, in the
opinion of the Directors, there is an impairment in the value of the individual investment.

**Trade receivables**
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. A prov1s1on for
impairment of trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the
income statement.

**Cash and cash equivalents**
For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at
bank and cash in hand.

**Borrowings**
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**Borrowing costs**
Interest on borrowings is treated as an expense in the income statement, with the exception of interest costs incurred
on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.

**Early termination costs**
Costs associated with the early repayment of borrowings are written off to the income statement as incurred.

**Derivative financial instruments**
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments have historically been
used by the Group to manage its exposure to interest rates on long-term floating-rate borrowings. All derivative
financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value. The Group does not currently hedge
account for any derivatives. As such, any gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the income statement.

**Embedded derivatives**
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not
measured at fair value through profit and loss.

**Trade payables**
Trade payables are obligations to pay f[o]r goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not. they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**Provisions**
Provisions for legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where there are a
number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering
the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any
one item included in the same class of obligations is small.

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Dividend distribution**
Dividend distributions to the Company's shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company's financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company's shareholders. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.

**Foreign currencies**
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. The resulting profit or loss, together with realised profits and losses arising during
the period on the settlement of overseas assets and liabilities, are included in the trading results. Transactions
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the
transaction.

**Employee benefits**
_Pensions_

      - Defined contribution pension scheme

Group employees can choose to be a member of a defined contribution pension scheme. A defined contribution
pension scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The
Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to
pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions are
charged to the income statement as incurred.

      - Defined benefit pension scheme

A funded senior management defined benefit pension scheme also exists. A defined benefit pension scheme is a
pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

The surplus or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together
with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates for
high-quality corporate bonds, which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Remeasurement gains and losses are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

_Profit-sharing and bonus plans_
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into
consideration the profit attributable to the Company's shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises
a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

_Holiday pay_
The Group recognises an appropriate liability for the cost of holiday entitlements not taken at the balance sheet date.

**Share capital**
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds.

**Other reserve**
The other reserve in the consolidated financial statements represents the differences on consolidation arising on the
adoption of predecessor accounting. This comprises the difference between consideration paid and the book value
of net assets acquired in the transaction. The other reserve in the Company financial statements represents the
application of group reconstruction relief in accordance with section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, following the
acquisition of certain subsidiaries in prior periods from fellow group companies.

**New standards and interpretations**
A number of new or revised accounting standards were effective for the first time in the current period; none of these
have impacted the financial statements of the Group or Company and are unlikely to have a material impact in the
future.

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has issued the following new or revised standards and
interpretations with an effective date for financial periods beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and
therefore after the date of these financial statements. The IASB has also issued a number of minor amendments to
standards as part of their annual improvement process.

IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration
New interpretation 1 January 2018
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
New interpretation 1 January 2019

The adoption of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' is expected to change the disclosure given in respect of financial
instruments but not the amounts reported in the financial statements.

The adoption of IFRS 16 'Leases' will result in the recognition of a right-to-use asset and a lease liability in respect of
the leases on the Longleat and Wobum sites. In addition, the lease charge recorded in the income statement will be
bifurcated between the amortisation of the right-to-use asset on a straight-line basis and the interest charge on the
lease liability will be recognised using the effective interest rate method. This will result in the overall charge to the
income statement being higher in the earlier years of a lease than in the later years. Operating lease charges are
currently recognised on a straight-line basis in the income statement. The Directors are assessing the monetary
impact of adopting IFRS 16, and are considering both the full and modified retrospective adoption approaches
permitted under the standard.

The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any other standards and interpretations listed above will have a
material impact on the Group or Company's financial statements in the period of initial application, although the
assessment is ongoing.

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating
Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 'Operating Segments'. The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as
the Board of Directors.

The operating segments are the five holiday villages that the business operates. Central Services costs are centrally
managed administration costs. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group's
accounting policies described in note 1.

The primary profit measure used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker is Adjusted EBITDA, being earnings before
interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional/non-underlying items.

The internal reporting does not disaggregate the balance sheet to each operating segment.

The split of revenue by business stream was £280.0 million (2017: £261.4 million) for accommodation and £189.0
million (2017: £178.9 million) for on-site spend. The split of gross profit was £253.3 million (2017: £237.2 million) for
accommodation and £92.0 million (2017: £87.4 million) for on-site spend.

The Directors monitor the level of non-audit work undertaken by the auditors and ensure it is work which they are
best suited to perform and does not present a risk to their independence and objectivity. The audit fee above
includes £2,000 (2017: £2,000) for the audit of the parent company.

###### 4. Exceptional/non-underlying items

The heavy snowfall in England in March 2018 caused the temporary closure of Longleat Forest and restricted guest
arrivals and activities at all other villages. Guests impacted by the snow were issued refunds of both their
accommodation and on-site spend. This was only the fourth time that a village has had to close in over 30 years of
trading. The Directors estimate that the lost revenue totalled £1.6 million and the overall reduction in EBITDA for the
53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 was approximately £1.5 million. As such, had the heavy snowfall not occurred,
Adjusted EBITDA would have been £229.9 million.

The following exceptional/non-underlying items are reflected in the financial statements:

**2018** 2017
**£m** £m

**Operating items**
Administrative expenses **(2.3)**

Exceptional/non-underlying administrative expenses represent £1.6 million of costs relating to legal claims and
associated settlements, together with £0.?m of one-off restructuring and reorganisation costs. Taxation on these
expenses has also been treated as an exceptional/non-underlying item.

exceptional/non-underlying item.

A taxation credit of £1.9 million in respect of a one-off adjustment to group relief has also been treated as an
exceptional/non-underlying item.

The £5.2 million exceptional/non-underlying finance expense in the prior period represented accelerated amortisation
of deferred issue costs in respect of the B2 tranche of secured notes. Taxation on this expense was also treated as
an exceptional/non-underlying item, as was the impact of the change in applicable deferred tax rate from 18% to
17%.

###### 7. Goodwill

**Group**

**Cost and net book value** **£rn**
At 26 April 2018, 20 April 2017 and 21 April 2016 **157.5**

**Impairment test for goodwill**

Goodwill relates to the acquisition of the Sherwood, Elveden, Longleat and Whinfell Villages only. It is allocated
equally to four cash-generating units (CGUs), being the four villages.

The Directors consider that the economic characteristics and future expectations are materially consistent across
each of the four villages.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash
flow projections based on financial forecasts prepared by management covering a rolling five-year period.

**Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations**

The value-in-use calculation is based on forecasts approved by the Board covering the next ten years with a terminal
value applied after year five.

The key assumptions of the value-in-use calculation are Adjusted EBITDA margin, growth rates and the discount
rate; the long-term growth rate applied is 2.30% (2017: 2.25%) and the discount rate applied is 9.0% (2017: 9.7%).

Management determine forecast Adjusted EBITDA margins based on past performance and expectations of market
development. The growth rates used reflect management's expectations of the future market. Discount rates used
are pre-tax and reflect the specific risks to the Group.

Based on the value-in-use calculations performed, the Directors have concluded that there is no impairment of
goodwill. The Directors have performed sensitivity analysis using the full range of reasonable assumptions and no
impairment triggers have been identified.

The Company has no goodwill.

**Fair value hierarchy**
IFRS 13 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value
hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either

directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

All of the Group's fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 1 (2017: Level 1) and fair values have
been derived from unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets.

**Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities**
The fair value of the Group's secured debt is:

**26 April 2018** 20 April 2017
**Book value** **Fair value** Book value Fair value
**£m** **£m** £m £m

Tranche A2 440.0 545.6 440.0 577.7
Tranche A3 350.0 355.6 350.0 364.0

Tranche B2 560.0 588.0
Tranche B3 480.0 483.5
Tranche B4 250.0 252.1

**1,768.6** **1,889.0** **1,490.0** **1,681.8**

The fair value of all other financial assets and financial liabilities are approximately equal to their book values.

**Maturity of financial liabilities**
The non-discounted minimum future cash flows in respect of financial liabilities are:

**Secured**

**Mortgage** **debt** **Total**

**At 26 April 2018** **£m** **£m** **£m**
In less than one year 0.3 82.4 82.7

###### 14. Financial instruments (continued)

**Financial risk management**
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity and borrowings as required. The Group has sought to
reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Group's funding using the underlying asset value.

All tranches of the Group's secured debt are subject to financial covenants. The Directors have assessed future
compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial covenants.

The overall policy in respect of interest rates is to reduce the Group's exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and the
Group's primary source of borrowings is fixed interest rate loan notes.

The Group does not actively trade in derivative financial instruments.

**Interest rate risk**
As at 26 April 2018 and 20 April 2017 the Group had fixed rate loan notes and a floating rate mortgage as its only
external funding sources.

**Liquidity risk**
As at 26 April 2018, the Group held sufficient levels of cash to enable it to meet its medium-term working capital and
funding obligations. Rolling forecasts of the Group's liquidity requirements are prepared and monitored, and surplus
cash is invested in interest bearing accounts.

**Currency risk**
The Group is exposed to limited currency risk through foreign currency transactions. The Group does not operate a
hedging facility to manage currency risk as it is considered to be insignificant.

**Credit risk**
The Group borrows from well-established institutions with high credit ratings. The Group's cash balances are held on
deposit with a number of UK banking institutions.
