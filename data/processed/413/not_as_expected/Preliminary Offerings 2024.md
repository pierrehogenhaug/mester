provisions. You have been sent the attached preliminary offering memorandum on the basis that you have confirmed to the

**Coordinators”), being the sender or senders of the attached, that you are (1)(a) not a U.S. person (within the meaning of**
Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”)) and (b) are located and accessing the e-mail to which this offering
memorandum is attached outside the United States of America, its territories or possessions (including Puerto Rico, the U.S.
Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island and the Northern Mariana Islands), any State of the United States or the
District of Columbia, and are (2)(a) a relevant person (as defined below) located in the United Kingdom or (b) a person that is
outside the United Kingdom and (3) not a “retail investor” if you are a resident in the United Kingdom or a member state of
the European Economic Area (the EEA).

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS - The Offered Notes are not intended to be offered,**
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the
European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a “retail
client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as
a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required
by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Offered Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Offered
Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the

defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European
Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended (“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA
and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of

as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Offered
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the
Offered Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation.

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM**
**CONFIDENTIAL**

# CPUK Finance Limited


**NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION**

**IN THE UNITED STATES**


(incorporated in Jersey with limited liability under registration number 108635)
£330,000,000   % Class B7 Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2055


CPUK Finance Limited (the “Issuer”), a company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of Jersey pursuant to the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, is offering
£330,000,000 aggregate principal amount of     % Class B7 Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2055 (the “Class B7 Notes” or the “Offered Notes”).

Interest on the Class B7 Notes will accrue at a rate of   % per annum (the “Class B7 Note Interest Rate”) from (and including) the issue date to (but excluding) 28 August 2029
(“Class B7 Note Step-Down Date”) and thereafter will accrue at a rate of   % per annum. Interest on the Class B7 Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on 28 February and 28 August
(subject to adjustment as specified herein for non-Business Days) (each, a “Note Interest Payment Date”) in each year commencing on 28 August 2024. The Issuer’s obligations to pay principal
and interest on the Class B7 Notes are intended to be met from the payments by Center Parcs (Holdings 3) Limited (“CPH3”) of principal and interest in the corresponding periods on the
£330,000,000 Class B7 Loan (as defined herein) granted by the Issuer to CPH3 on the issue date of the Offered Notes pursuant to the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (each
as defined herein). If on any Note Interest Payment Date, the amount received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B7 Loan is not sufficient to pay the interest accrued on
the Class B7 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period in full, the amount of interest accrued up to any such Note Interest Payment Date that is not paid by the Issuer on such
Note Interest Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest, being a “Deferred Interest Amount”) and such Deferred Interest Amount shall continue to accrue interest at
the then applicable Class B7 Note Interest Rate until it is paid by the Issuer in full. Interest paid on the Class B7 Loans will be payable in cash on each Loan Interest Payment Date (as defined
herein) to (but not including) 25 August 2029 (the “Class B7 Loan Expected Maturity Date”) and thereafter accruing interest shall be deferred.

The Class B7 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full on 28 August 2029 (the “Class B7 Note Expected Maturity Date”). The Class B7 Notes will be subject to mandatory
redemption and/or may be subject to optional redemption before such dates in certain circumstances, including if and to the extent the Borrowers make principal repayments or prepayments to the
Issuer in respect of the Class B7 Loan. See “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes — Condition 5 (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation)”.

The Borrowers may prepay the Class B7 Loan in whole or in part at any time on or after 28 August 2026 at the prepayment prices specified herein. Prior to 28 August 2026, the
Borrowers may prepay the Class B7 Loan in whole or in part at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts, if any,
up to the prepayment date plus the applicable “make-whole” premium, as described herein. Prior to 28 August 2026, the Borrowers may prepay up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount
of the Class B7 Loan in each calendar year at a prepayment price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Class B7 Loan prepaid. In addition, prior to 28 August 2026, the Borrowers may use
the net proceeds of specified equity offerings to prepay up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Class B7 Loan at a prepayment price equal to   % of the principal amount of the Class
B7 Loan prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts, if any, up to the prepayment date, provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Class B7
Loan remains outstanding following the prepayment. Additionally, the Borrowers may prepay all, but not less than all, of the Class B7 Loan at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, up to the prepayment date
upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon certain events constituting a change of control, the Borrowers may be required to make an offer to repurchase all the Class B7
Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and
additional amounts, if any, up to the purchase date. In the event of any prepayment by the Borrowers of the Class B7 Loan, in whole or in part, the Issuer will be required to apply the proceeds
received from such prepayment to redeem a corresponding principal amount of Class B7 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid
interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, at a redemption price corresponding to the applicable prepayment price set forth in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. In addition,
in connection with certain tender offers for the Class B7 Notes, if holders of not less than 90 per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B7 Notes validly tender and do
not withdraw such Class B7 Notes in such tender offer and a Borrower purchases all of the Class B7 Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Borrowers may prepay the
remaining principal amount of the Class B7 Loan, in whole, but not in part, at a price equal to the purchase price offered to holders of the Class B7 Notes pursuant to such tender offer and the
Issuer will be required to apply the proceeds received from such prepayment to redeem a corresponding principal amount of Class B7 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest
amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, at a redemption price corresponding to the prepayment price.

The Offered Notes will rank pari passu with the Class B5 Notes and the Class B6 Notes. The Offered Notes will be contractually subordinated to, among others, the Class A Notes
(as defined herein) and will not be guaranteed by any person, except that the Offered Notes will benefit indirectly from the Topco Payment Undertaking (as defined below). The Class B Loans (as
defined herein) are contractually subordinated to, among others, the Class A Loans (as defined herein), the Liquidity Facility (as defined herein) and certain hedging arrangements, as described
further herein. The Class B Loans are guaranteed by the Borrowers and certain subsidiaries of CP Cayman Midco 2 Limited (“Topco”), as further described herein. Pursuant to an amended and
restated deed of undertaking entered into on the Fourth Closing Date to be further amended and restated on or around the Ninth Closing Date (the “Topco Payment Undertaking”), Topco has
undertaken to procure payment of all principal, interest and other amounts outstanding under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in the circumstances described herein, including in the
event that the Class B7 Loan is not repaid in full on the Class B7 Loan Expected Maturity Date. The Offered Notes will be secured by substantially all the Issuer’s property and assets (including
its rights against each Obligor under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement), which security will also be shared with, among others, the Class A Notes. The Offered Notes will rank junior
to the Class A Notes with respect to the application of enforcement proceeds, other than in respect of the Topco Security. The Class B Loans rank junior to the Class A Loans, the Liquidity Facility
and certain hedging arrangements with respect to the application of enforcement proceeds, other than in respect of the Topco Security (as defined herein). The Topco Payment Undertaking is
secured by first-ranking security in respect of all the issued and outstanding shares of CP Cayman Limited and of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited, together with a floating charge over all of
Topco and CP Cayman Limited’s assets, as further described herein. The Topco Security has been granted for the sole benefit of holders of the Class B Notes.

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the Offered Notes to be admitted to the Official List (the “Official List”) of
The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). No assurance can be given that the application will be granted. Furthermore, admission of the Offered Notes to the Official List is not an
indication of the merits of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Offered Notes. There can be no assurance that Offered Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that permission to deal
in the Offered Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. Carey Olsen Corporate Finance Limited is acting solely in its capacity as listing agent for the Issuer in relation to the
Class B7 Notes and is not itself seeking admission of the Class B7 Notes to the Official List.

The issue price of the Class B7 Notes is   %


**Investing in the Offered Notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 36.**


**The Offered Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or the securities laws of any other**
**jurisdiction. Subject to certain exceptions, the Offered Notes may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States, or for the account or benefit of, or to any U.S. persons (as**
**defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act). Accordingly, the Offered Notes are being offered and sold only outside the United States to persons who are not U.S. persons in**
**accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions” for additional information about eligible offerees and transfer restrictions.**

or any other information supplied in connection with the Offered Notes or their distribution. The statements made in
this paragraph are without prejudice to the respective responsibilities of the Issuer and the Obligors. Each person

investment decision.

The Issuer accepts responsibility for the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. To the best of
the knowledge and belief of the Issuer (having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case), the information
contained in this Offering Memorandum is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the

The Issuer is of the opinion that the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 (the “EU Securitisation
**Regulation”) do not apply to the Offered Notes. The Issuer is of the opinion that the requirements of Regulation (EU)**
2017/2402 as it forms part of domestic law of the United Kingdom by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act
2018, as amended (“EUWA”) and the Securitisation (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/660) (the
“UK Securitisation Regulation”) do not apply to the Offered Notes.

On issue, it is expected that the Offered Notes will be assigned the respective ratings of S&P Global Ratings
UK Limited (“S&P”) and Fitch Ratings Ltd (“Fitch” and, together with S&P, the “Rating Agencies” and each, a
“Rating Agency”). As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, both Rating Agencies are established in the United
Kingdom and are registered in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 1060/2009 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (the “UK CRA Regulation”). Each of S&P and Fitch is not established in the EEA and has not
applied for registration under Regulation (EC) No. 1060/2009 (as amended) (the “CRA Regulation”). The ratings
issued by S&P have been endorsed by S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited and the ratings issued by Fitch have been
endorsed by Fitch Ratings Ireland Limited in accordance with the CRA Regulation. Each of S&P Global Ratings
Europe Limited and Fitch Ratings Ireland Limited is established in the EEA and registered under the CRA Regulation.
As such, each of S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited and Fitch Ratings Ireland Limited is included in the list of credit
rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority on its website (at
[http://www.esma.europa.eu/page/List-registered-and-certified-CRAs) in accordance with the CRA Regulation. A](https://clicktime.symantec.com/338RGVJJAuMrDzzf1MEKFKJ6H2?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.esma.europa.eu%2Fpage%2FList-registered-and-certified-CRAs)
credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or
withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organisation. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal of any rating may
adversely affect the market price of such securities.

The Jersey Financial Services Commission has given, and has not withdrawn, or will have given prior to the
issuance of the Offered Notes and not withdrawn, its consent under Article 4 of the Control of Borrowing (Jersey)
Order 1958 to the issuance of the Offered Notes.

It must be distinctly understood that, in giving this consent, the Jersey Financial Services Commission takes
no responsibility for the financial soundness of the Issuer or for the correctness of any statements made, or opinion
expressed, with regard to it.

The Jersey Financial Services Commission is protected by the Control of Borrowing (Jersey) Law 1947, as
amended, against liability arising from the discharge of its functions under that law.

The Issuer expects that delivery of the Offered Notes will be made on the respective Offered Notes on or
about    2024, which will be the    business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange
Act) following the date of pricing of the Offered Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+  ” (U.S.)).
Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business
days (until the end of the period of transition to a settlement cycle of T+1 on May 28, 2024) unless the parties to any
such trade expressly agree otherwise.

In connection with the issuance of the Offered Notes, Barclays Bank PLC (the “Stabilisation Manager”) or
any person acting on its behalf may, to the extent permitted by all applicable laws, regulations, rules and directives,
over-allot and effect transactions in any over-the-counter market or otherwise in connection with the distribution of
the Offered Notes with a view to supporting the market price of the Offered Notes at a level higher than that which
might otherwise prevail. However, there is no assurance that the Stabilisation Manager (or any agent of the
Stabilisation Manager) will undertake any stabilisation action. Any stabilisation action may begin on or after the date
on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the Offered Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended
at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issuance of the Offered Notes and 60 days
after the date of allotment of the Offered Notes and must be brought to an end after a limited period in compliance
with applicable laws, regulations and rules.

This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to subscribe for or purchase
any of the Offered Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation is not authorised or to any person to
whom it is unlawful to make such an offer or invitation. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of
this Offering Memorandum and the offer and sale of the Offered Notes. Persons into whose possession this Offering
Memorandum or any of the Offered Notes are delivered must inform themselves about and observe those restrictions.
Each prospective purchaser of the Offered Notes must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any
jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers or sells the Offered Notes or possesses or distributes this Offering
Memorandum. In addition, each prospective purchaser must obtain any consent, approval or permission required under

ii


-----

the regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it purchases, offers or sells the Offered
Notes. We, the Issuer and the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners shall not have any responsibility
for obtaining such consent, approval or permission.

The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review
or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisors to determine whether and
to what extent (1) the Offered Notes are legal investments for it; (2) the Offered Notes can be used as security for
indebtedness; and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any of the Offered Notes. Financial
institutions should consult their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of
the Offered Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

**Volcker Rule**

Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and Regulation VV (12 C.F.R. Section
248) promulgated thereunder by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (such statutory provision
together with such implementing regulation, the “Volcker Rule”) generally prohibit “banking entities” (which term
is broadly defined to include any U.S. bank or savings association whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, any company that controls any such bank or savings association, any foreign bank treated as
a bank holding company for purposes of Section 8 of the International Banking Act of 1978, as amended, and any
affiliate or subsidiary of any of the foregoing entities) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading as defined in the Volcker
Rule, (ii) acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in or sponsoring a “covered fund” and (iii) entering into certain
relationships with such funds.

Under the Volcker Rule, a “covered fund” generally includes an issuer organized or established outside the
United States (such as the Issuer) (a) that, if such issuer were to offer securities to residents of the United States, would
be an "investment company" as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment
Company Act”), but for an exclusion contained in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) thereof, or (b) that is a
“commodity pool” under Section 1(a)(10) of the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the “CEA”),
so long as the operator of such pool (i) has claimed an exemption under Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(“CFTC”) Regulation 4.7 or (ii) is registered with the CFTC as a commodity pool operator but substantially all of the
participation units of the commodity pool are owned by "qualified eligible persons". Any prospective investor in the
Offered Notes, including a U.S. or foreign bank or a subsidiary or other affiliate thereof, should consult its own legal
advisors regarding the Volcker Rule.

The Issuer is not, and after giving effect to any offering and sale of the Offered Notes and the application of
the proceeds thereof will not be, a “covered fund” for purposes of the Volcker Rule. In reaching this conclusion, the
Issuer has determined that (a) the Issuer is not, and if the Issuer were to offer securities to residents of the United
States would not be, required to rely solely on Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act for
an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act and (b) the Issuer is not a commodity pool under
the CEA.

**Notice to U.S. Investors**

The Offered Notes have not been registered, approved or disapproved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”), any state securities commission in the United States or any other U.S. regulatory authority,
nor have any of the foregoing authorities passed upon or endorsed the merits of the Offered Notes or the accuracy or
the adequacy of this Offering Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United
States.

Each purchaser of the Offered Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and
acknowledgments that are described in this Offering Memorandum under “Notice to Investors and Transfer
_Restrictions”. The Offered Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or with any_
securities regulatory authority of any other jurisdiction. The Offered Notes may be offered, sold or delivered only
outside the United States to persons who are not “U.S. persons” as defined in Regulation S (each, a “U.S. person”) in
offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The Offered Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means
a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU

iii


-----

(“MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (“Insurance Distribution Directive”),
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering or selling the Offered Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the**
United Kingdom or the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Offered Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**MIFID II product governance / target market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Offered Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Offered Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the
Offered Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending the Offered Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Offered Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Notice to Investors in the United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum is directed solely at persons who (i) are investment professionals, as such term
is defined in Article 19(5) of the Financial Promotion Order, (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d)
(“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the
United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or
sale of any Offered Notes may otherwise be lawfully communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons
together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum must not be acted on or relied on by
persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum
relate is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. Any person who is not
a relevant person should not act or rely on this Offering Memorandum or any of its contents. The Offered Notes are
not being offered to the public in the United Kingdom.

**Prohibition of Sales to United Kingdom Retail Investors**

The Offered Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a
**retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of:**

(i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations
made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Offered Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling
the Offered Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful
under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**UK MiFIR product governance / target market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Offered Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Offered Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook
(“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Offered Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending
the Offered Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;

i


-----

however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK
**MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of**
the Offered Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**Germany**

The offering of the Offered Notes is not a public offering in the Federal Republic of Germany (“Germany”).
In Germany, the Offered Notes may only be offered and sold in accordance with the provisions of the Securities
Prospectus Act of the Federal Republic of Germany (the “Securities Prospectus Act, **_Wertpapierprospektgesetz,_**
**_WpPG”) and any other applicable German law. No application has been made under German law to offer the Offered_**
Notes to the public in or out of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Offered Notes are not registered or authorized
for distribution under the Securities Prospectus Act and accordingly may not be, and are not being, offered or
advertised publicly or by public promotion. This Offering Memorandum is strictly for private use and the offer is only
being made to recipients to whom this Offering Memorandum is personally addressed and does not constitute an offer
or advertisement to the public. The Issuer has not, and does not intend to, file a securities prospectus with the German
Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (“BaFin”) or obtain a notification to BaFin from another competent authority
of a Member State, with which a securities prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to Section 17 para. 3 of the
Securities Prospectus Act. In Germany, the Offered Notes will only be available to, and this Offering Memorandum
and any other offering material in relation to the Offered Notes is directed only at, persons who are qualified investors
(qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of Section 2 No. 6 of the Securities Prospectus Act or who are subject of
another exemption in accordance with Section 3 para. 2 of the Securities Prospectus Act. Any resale of the Offered
Notes in Germany may only be made in accordance with the Securities Prospectus Act and other applicable laws.

**Austria**

The Offered Notes may only be offered in the Republic of Austria in compliance with the provisions of the
Austrian Capital Market Act (Kapitalmarktgesetz) and other laws applicable in the Republic of Austria governing the
offer and sale of the Offered Notes in the Republic of Austria. The Offered Notes have not been registered or otherwise
authorized for a public offer under either the Austrian Capital Market Act (Kapitalmarktgesetz), the Investment Fund
Act 2011 (Investmentfondsgesetz 2011) or any other Austrian securities law in Austria. Neither this Offering
Memorandum nor any other document in connection with the Offered Notes is a prospectus according to the Austrian
Capital Market Act (Kapitalmarktgesetz), the Stock Exchange Act (Börsegesetz) or the Investment Fund Act 2011
(Investmentfondsgesetz 2011) and has therefore not been drawn up, audited, approved, passported and/or published in
accordance with the aforesaid acts. In Austria, the Offered Notes will only be available to, and this Offering
Memorandum and any other selling material relating to the Offered Notes is directed only at, persons who are qualified
investors (qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of section 1 para. 1 No. 5a of the Austrian Capital Market Act
(Kapitalmarktgesetz). The recipients of this Offering Memorandum and other selling material with respect to the
Offered Notes have been individually selected and identified before the offer is made and are targeted exclusively on

publicly or offered similarly in the Republic of Austria. No offer will be made to any persons in Austria other than the
recipients to whom this Offering Memorandum is personally addressed. This Offering Memorandum is distributed
under the condition that the foregoing obligations are accepted by the recipient and that the recipient undertakes to
comply with the above selling and transfer restrictions.

meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French Code monétaire et financier and Title I of Book II of the Réglement Général

portfolio management for the account of third parties (personnes fournissant le service d’investissement de gestion de

Exchange Ltd. The Offered Notes are being offered in Switzerland by way of a private placement (i.e., to a limited

condition and liquidity of the Center Parcs Group, and the development of the industry in which the Center Parcs

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**Historical Financial Information**

The financial information presented and discussed in this Offering Memorandum, unless otherwise indicated,
has been derived from (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited as at and
for each of the 52-week periods ended 20 April 2023, 21 April 2022 and 22 April 2021, in each case prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, and (ii) the unaudited interim consolidated income statement,
balance sheet and cash flow statement of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited as at and for each of the 36-week periods
ended 28 December 2023 and 29 December 2022 incorporated by reference into this Offering Memorandum (the
“Interim Financial Information”).

The audited consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited as at and for the 52-week
period ended 20 April 2023 (the “2023 Audited Financial Statements”), the 52-week period ended 21 April 2022
and the 52-week period ended 22 April 2021 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum have been audited by
Deloitte LLP, independent auditor, as stated in their reports included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The
audit reports, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, express an unqualified opinion for each of the
respective audited periods. The Interim Financial Information as at and for the 36-week periods ended 28 December
2023 and 29 December 2022 has been reviewed by Deloitte LLP in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting.

**Unaudited “as adjusted” financial information**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain financial information as adjusted to reflect the impact of the
Transaction as at and for the 52-week period ended 28 December 2023 and for the 52-week period ended 21 March
2024. The “as adjusted” financial data has been included to illustrate the effect of the Transactions on the consolidated
balance sheet of Center Parcs as if the Transactions had occurred on 28 December 2023, and to illustrate the effect of
the Transactions on the consolidated income statement of Center Parcs as if the Transactions had occurred on 30
December 2022, or where indicated, 23 March 2023. The financial information as of and for the 52-week period ended
21 March 2024 has not been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and has not been audited
or reviewed by Deloitte LLP. Moreover, as certain year-end procedures were not performed in preparing the financial
information as of and for the 52-week period ended 21 March 2024, it may not represent the same financial information
that would have resulted if Center Parcs had produced year-end financial statements as of and for the 52-week period

The “as adjusted” financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions
underlying the adjustments nor the resulting adjusted financial information have been audited or reviewed in
accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. The “as adjusted” financial data is presented for illustrative
purposes only and should not be considered a presentation of the actual results of operations that would have been
attained had the Transactions actually occurred at an earlier date or in an earlier period.

The “as adjusted” financial data should be read in conjunction with the information presented in “Use of
_Proceeds”, “Capitalisation” and the audited Center Parcs consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this_
Offering Memorandum.

**Reporting Terms**

The financial year of Center Parcs is divided into 13 four-week periods to enable more meaningful
conclusions to be drawn when periods are compared as all accounting periods contain the same number of days and
an equal number of weekend and mid-week breaks. For existing quarterly reporting purposes, Center Parcs reports at
the end of periods three, six, nine and thirteen. This reporting corresponds to three periods of 12 weeks and one period
of 16 weeks in each financial year.

**_Non-IFRS Financial and Operating Measures_**

_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios, including EBITDA
and, with respect to certain historic periods, Adjusted EBITDA, and leverage and coverage ratios, that are not required
by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. These measures are not measures of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited’s
consolidated financial performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to (a)
operating profit or profit/(loss) for the period as a measure of operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating,
investing and financing activities as a measure of Center Parcs’ ability to meet their cash needs or (c) any other
measures of performance under IFRS.

Center Parcs defines EBITDA as profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders before interest,
taxation, depreciation and amortisation. Center Parcs defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA as defined above, further
adjusted to remove the effects of certain exceptional and non-underlying items that Center Parcs believes are not
indicative of its underlying operating performance. Center Parcs believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are
useful indicators of Center Parcs’ ability to incur and service its indebtedness and may assist investors, security
analysts and other interested parties in evaluating Center Parcs’ financial performance. Management uses EBITDA as
the primary profit measure to assess the performance of the operating segments and discloses it within the consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. As all companies do not calculate EBITDA
or Adjusted EBITDA on a consistent basis, Center Parcs’ presentation of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA may not be
comparable to measures under the same or similar names used by other companies. Accordingly, undue reliance
should not be placed on EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in this Offering Memorandum. EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and investors should not consider them in isolation. Some of these
limitations are that:

      - they do not reflect Center Parcs’ cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments;

      - they do not reflect the changes in, or cash requirements for, Center Parcs’ working capital needs;

      - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments on Center Parcs’ debt;

      - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that Center Parcs may be required to pay;

      - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in Center Parcs’
consolidated income statement;

      - in the case of Adjusted EBITDA (but not EBITDA), it does not reflect the impact of earnings or
charges resulting from certain matters Center Parcs consider not to be indicative of its underlying
operations;

      - assets are depreciated or amortised over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be
replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such
replacements; and

      - other companies in Center Parcs’ industry may calculate these measures differently from the manner
Center Parcs does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

For a reconciliation of EBITDA to profit/(loss) for the period attributable to equity shareholders, see
“Summary Historical Financial and Operating Information”.

In addition, this Offering Memorandum includes the following key performance indicators that Center Parcs’
Directors use to set targets and measure performance against those targets.

iii


-----

_Occupancy_

Occupancy is the average number of units of accommodation occupied as a percentage of the total number
available. Units of accommodation are deemed to be occupied when utilised during the relevant period under review.
When units of accommodation are out of service for refurbishment, they are still included in the occupancy
calculations. Center Parcs is focused on driving occupancy levels to optimise the number of guests, which in turn
increases accommodation revenue and optimises on-site expenditure.

_Average Daily Rate (“ADR”)_

ADR is the average rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total accommodation income for the period
divided by the total number of accommodation nights sold. Center Parcs uses ADR to help measure and maximise its
yield.

_Rent Per Available Lodge night (“RevPAL”)_

RevPAL is the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on the total accommodation income
divided by the total available number of accommodation nights. Center Parcs’ management believes RevPAL to be
the most meaningful key performance indicator because it takes into account both occupancy and ADR.

_Net on-site guest spend per lodge night_

Net on-site guest spend per lodge night is calculated as on-site spend at Center Parcs-operated units and the
rent received from concession partners (i.e. on-site revenue) for a period, divided by the sum of the number of guestoccupied lodges during each night of such period.

_Forward bookings as a percentage of available capacity_

Forward bookings as a percentage of available capacity means the number of accommodation nights sold
divided by total available accommodation nights for the period. This indicator provides management with forward
visibility of future occupancy levels.

**OVERVIEW**

Center Parcs is a leading UK short-break holiday business, attracting 2.1 million guests in the financial year
ended 20 April 2023. Center Parcs operates five specially constructed holiday villages in the UK: Sherwood Forest in
Nottinghamshire, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Elveden Forest in Suffolk, Whinfell Forest in Cumbria (the “Original
**Villages”) and Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire. Each village is set in a forest environment amongst approximately 400**
acres of forest around a lake and is typically open 365 days per year.

Woodland, water and a natural environment make up the essential elements of a Center Parcs break. Within
this comfortable, quiet, car-free and family-friendly setting, each of the Center Parcs villages provides guests with
high-quality accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. In total, as of 28 December 2023, there
were 4,334 units of accommodation across its five villages, which could accommodate approximately 22,946 guests
per day at 100% occupancy. The focal point and key attraction of each village is an all-weather indoor sub-tropical
swimming paradise, featuring a selection of water activities including a wave pool, river slides and rides, children’s
pools and Jacuzzis. Center Parcs’ on-site experiences also include outdoor activities such as cycling, boating and zip
wires; indoor activities such as ten-pin bowling, badminton and pottery; and amenities such as spas, food and beverage
and retail. A significant proportion of Center Parcs’ revenue is generated from guests’ on-site spending, including for
leisure and spa activities, food and beverage and retail, representing 38.3% of total revenue in the financial year ended
20 April 2023 and 39.4% in the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023.

Center Parcs has a well-established brand in the UK, renowned for providing high-quality experiences and
facilities, targeting a primary guest base of affluent families. Center Parcs benefits from strong guest loyalty with
approximately 31.7% of guests returning within a 14-month period of their initial visit and approximately 54.1% of
guests returning within a five-year period as of financial year 2023. Furthermore, in the financial year ended 20 April
2023, 95% of guests indicated an intention to return in the future. Center Parcs believes that its business model is
difficult to replicate due to the lack of suitable locations for the development of holiday parks and high development
costs while Center Parcs is well positioned to continue to grow its business.

Center Parcs’ villages typically draw on a regional population of guests who are attracted to the convenience
of being within a relatively short driving distance from home. Over 80% of the UK population lives within a 2.5-hour
drive of at least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two-hour drive of
the village they choose to visit. Center Parcs believes that the proximity of the majority of guests to its villages
combined with the easy accessibility of the villages by car make Center Parcs a popular and convenient short break
holiday option. Occupancy levels at Center Parcs’ villages have recovered to their pre-COVID-19 levels. As a result
of village closures and occupancy restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, occupancy levels fell to 22.4%
in financial year 2021. Occupancy levels rose to 80.5% in financial year 2022, with self-imposed capacity restrictions
in place, and further to 97.1% in the financial year 2023, broadly in line with pre-COVID-19 occupancy rates. In the
36-week period ended 28 December 2023 occupancy levels were 97.1% (97.3% for the 36-week period ended 29
December 2022). Occupancy levels have averaged approximately 97.0% in the last 15 years and approximately 97.4%
in the last eight years, in each case excluding financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022 (which were impacted by COVID19 closures and self-imposed capacity restrictions).

In each of the financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, revenue and EBITDA have been broadly
evenly split amongst Center Parcs’ villages, reflecting both the individual strength of each village and the diversity of
Center Parcs’ asset base.

The map below shows the location of each of Center Parcs’ villages in the UK as of 18 April 2024.

With the exception of the financial years impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, revenue and EBITDA have
consistently grown over the past fifteen years. Total revenue and EBITDA were £593.8 million and £275.0 million,
respectively, for financial year 2023, which marks an increase compared to £503.4 million and £245.6 million,
respectively, in financial year 2022. For the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023, Center Parcs had revenue of
£439.3 million and EBITDA of £208.7 million, representing an EBITDA margin of 47.5%.

no revenues, as well as localised closures as a result of the tier restrictions in later periods. EBITDA for financial year 2021 was a loss

where applicable.

**STRENGTHS**

**Unique, market-leading short break holiday business.**

Center Parcs believes that it provides a unique product in the UK holiday market in terms of scale, quality
and standard of accommodation and amenities. Each Center Parcs village is set in approximately 400 acres of forest
around a lake, with numerous retail and food and beverage offerings, as well as more than 150 leisure and spa related
activities and an indoor sub-tropical swimming paradise. Each village has on average 867 units of accommodation
with capacity for approximately 4,589 guests Center Parcs believes that it is the only large-scale UK business offering
this type of high-quality family-focused, year-round, all-weather, short-break package, in a forest environment. Center
Parcs believes that it is well-positioned to benefit from demand for domestic travel, with its villages typically drawing
on a regional population of guests who live within a relatively short driving distance. In a Mintel survey of
approximately 1,000 people in November 2023, only 3% of respondents stated that they did not intend to take a
domestic holiday or short break in the next twelve months.

**Difficult to replicate concept with well-known brand and loyal, affluent customer base.**

The Center Parcs villages are characterised by a number of qualities that Center Parcs believes make its business
model difficult to replicate in the UK. These include:

- limited appropriate sites for villages, which require large forested areas near major population centres;

- long lead time needed to develop new villages due to the stringent requirements for obtaining planning permits;

- significant initial investment cost in addition to on-going capital expenditure required for further development
and operations of the business; and

- a wide range of specialised operations and planning expertise required to develop and operate a village.

Center Parcs’ unique product offering has generated strong brand recognition and guest loyalty. Center Parcs
believes that it has a brand awareness of over 90% in the UK and is considered among the top brands for high-quality
short breaks in the UK.

Center Parcs’ “intention to return” score was 95% in financial year 2023. Approximately 31.7% of Center Parcs’
guests return within a 14-month period of their initial visit and approximately 54.1% of guests return within a fiveyear period as of financial year 2023. Center Parcs maintains a guest database of approximately 323,000 active guests
as of 9 April 2024 (i.e., those who had a Center Parcs break in the last 26 months or have an active booking and are
contactable by email).

The following graph shows the percentage of Center Parcs guests returning within a five-year period for
financial years 2019 to 2023:

-----

Center Parcs’ guest profile has remained stable over time and consists of the highest earning categories of
the UK population. According to management estimates, Center Parcs ranked significantly over index in a number of
the Experian high end consumer classifications, with 58.9% of guests in financial year 2023 identified under the
Experian Mosaic classification as “Domestic Success”, “Prestige Positions” or “Aspiring Homemakers” based on
postcode analysis.

**Resilient growth through economic cycles.**

Resilient performance through economic cycles, during both downturns and recoveries, and also through
additions in capacity, has resulted in Center Parcs’ occupancy levels averaging over 95.8% over the last 20 years,
approximately 97.0% in the last 15 years and approximately 97.4% in the last eight years in each case excluding
financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022 (which were impacted by COVID-19 closures and self-imposed capacity
restrictions), with occupancy levels of 22.4%, 80.5%, and 97.1% in financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.
Occupancy at each of the villages has historically remained high even after the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014
despite an approximately 20% increase in Center Parcs’ accommodation available, demonstrating the depth of demand
for Center Parcs’ villages. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic conditions as well as on
guests’ willingness to travel, demand for Center Parcs’ villages remained resilient and exceeded expected operating
capacity for some breaks.

The following graph shows Center Parcs’ occupancy rates and average units of accommodation for financial
years 2011 to 2023.

5


-----

(1) Occupancy levels for financial year 2020 and 2021 were heavily impacted by the closure of all five holiday villages from 20 March
2020 to 13 July 2020, 5 November 2020 to 4 December 2020 and 21 December 2020 to 12 April 2021, during which Center Parcs was
either receiving no guests or operating at significantly reduced capacity, as well as localised closures as a result of the tier restrictions
in later periods. After the reopening of the villages on 21 April 2021, Center Parcs’ villages operated with reduced capacity during
financial years 2021 and 2022.

(2) Due to self-imposed restrictions, Center Parcs’ villages operated at 80.5% capacity during financial year 2022 which affected revenues
from accommodation and on-site sales.

High occupancy levels drive a significant proportion of revenue from guests’ on-site spending, which
represented 38.3% of Center Parcs’ total revenue in the financial year ended 20 April 2023.

The growth of ADR and RevPAL, driven by yield management initiatives, demand and on-site investment,
including in new types of accommodation and upgrades to existing accommodation, allows Center Parcs to remain
profitable in an inflationary economic environment. ADR for the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023 was
£251.01, compared with £252.14 for the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022. ADR for the financial year 2023
was £239.28, compared with £256.09 and £239.70 for financial years 2022 and 2021, respectively. RevPAL for the
36-week period ended 28 December 2023 was £243.83, compared with £245.41 for the 36-week period ended 29
December 2022. RevPAL for the financial year 2023 was £232.39, compared with £206.23. and £53.45 for financial
years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

**Consistent revenue growth with strong visibility through forward-booking model.**

With the exception of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in financial years 2020 and 2021, Center Parcs
experienced revenue growth each year over the previous ten years, with revenue growing at a CAGR of 6.9% from
financial year 2013 to financial year 2023. In addition, Center Parcs’ EBITDA (or Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable)
has grown at a CAGR of 7.0% from financial year 2013 to financial year 2023. Center Parcs places a strong emphasis
on advance prepaid bookings, which result in significant revenue visibility, with an average of 22 weeks’ booking-toarrival time in the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023. For financial year 2023, 46% of the available
accommodation nights had been booked by the beginning of the financial year, 60% by the end of the first quarter,
73% halfway through the financial year, and 93% two months before the end of the financial year.

6


-----

Under its standard terms and conditions, Center Parcs collects 30% of the accommodation cost at the time of
booking if completed more than ten weeks in advance of the short break. The balance of the cost is collected ten weeks
prior to the start of the break. If a guest books less than ten weeks prior to the arrival date, the accommodation cost is
payable in full on booking. As at 22 March 2024, bookings for financial year 2024 were 97% sold, in line with
bookings for financial year 2023 as at the same point in March 2023. Bookings for financial year 2025 were 39% sold
as at 22 March 2024, in-line with bookings for financial year 2024 as at the same point in March 2023. Historically,
at the end of each financial year, approximately 40% of the bookings for Center Parcs’ villages for the following
financial year have been sold, excluding financial years 2020 and 2021, which were impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic. As of 18 April 2024, 45% of bookings for financial year 2025 were sold.

**Sustainable cash flow generation.**

With the exception of the periods impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs’ EBITDA margins
have been underpinned by high occupancy levels and consistent growth in ADR. Relatively high EBITDA margins
combined with the negative working capital characteristics of the business due to its forward-booking model and the
relatively low maintenance capital expenditure requirements, which averaged £26.7 million per financial year from
financial year 2013 to financial year 2023, has enabled Center Parcs to be highly cash generative, with unlevered
operating cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA of 73.9% in financial year 2023 (2019: 72.6%; 2020: 68.5%; 2022:
93.1%) (comparison to 2021 excluded as COVID-19 impacts led to negative EBITDA).

**Well-invested, diversified and high-quality asset base.**

Center Parcs owns all five of its UK villages on either freehold titles or long leasehold titles, and with
remaining lease terms of between 50 years and 977 years, Center Parcs’ asset base has a long life and is diversified
and stable. In financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, revenue and EBITDA have been broadly evenly split
amongst its villages, located in different parts of the UK, reflecting both the individual strength of each village and
the diversity of Center Parcs’ asset base.

Center Parcs has an on-going capital expenditure programme to maintain and enhance the quality of its asset
base, pursuant to which it has invested approximately £635 million from financial year 2013 through financial year
2023. Of this investment, £283 million represents maintenance capital expenditures. The remainder represents
investment capital expenditure, of which £154 million was invested to upgrade existing accommodation, £105 million
was invested in on-site development, including new leisure activities, food and beverage offerings and facilities
upgrades and £17 million was invested in its Digital Roadmap project. In addition, Center Parcs incurred
approximately £250 million of total initial development costs in respect of building Woburn Forest.

In financial years 2022 and 2023, capital expenditure primarily related to a range of ongoing village
refurbishments of accommodation, restaurants, retail outlets, spas and other offerings and facilities. Center Parcs has
added 300 new units of accommodation since 2015 and, on average since 2018, refurbishes 300 to 400 units of
accommodation per year.

**Experienced management team with a track record of innovation.**

Center Parcs has an experienced management team with a proven ability to execute its business plans and
achieve results. In addition, Center Parcs’ management team has a track record of innovation reflected in its yield
management initiatives, innovation in on-site activities and food and beverage offerings, as well as development of
new types of accommodation to help drive ADR. In 2014, the management team successfully opened Woburn Forest
on time and on budget. With an average length of service of over 15 years by individual members of its management
team, the management team is highly experienced in providing the services that set Center Parcs apart from other UK
leisure and holiday providers. Center Parcs also benefits from the operational expertise, relationships, and
management experience of Brookfield.

**STRATEGIES**

**Continue to grow revenue through yield management, flexible pricing, targeted marketing and customer**
**relationship management.**

Center Parcs actively manages pricing across its villages to maintain its high level of occupancy and to
optimise yield during periods of high demand. All bookings are made directly with Center Parcs, with approximately
92% of accommodation bookings made online in financial year 2023. Together with its strong emphasis on advance

7


-----

bookings (average 22 weeks’ booking-to-arrival time period in financial year 2023), this provides Center Parcs with
significant operational information, allowing it to respond quickly to customer trends in order to optimise its pricing.
Center Parcs will continue to operate a flexible pricing model to further grow revenue, and to develop its customer
relationship management initiatives to increase demand from the affluent families that form its core guest base.

Center Parcs’ guest database of approximately 323,000 active guests (i.e., those who had a Center Parcs break in the
last 26 months or have an active booking and are contactable by email) allows it to undertake targeted marketing
campaigns using a range of channels, including direct mailings, online and digital marketing, television campaigns
and email programmes focused on both existing customers and targeted acquisition of new affluent families.

**Continue to invest in revenue-enhancing upgrades of Center Parcs accommodation offering and to expand**
**available capacity.**

Center Parcs plans to continue to invest in upgrading the accommodation and facilities in its villages, and to
introduce new accommodation and on-site activities. Since 2007, Center Parcs has significantly upgraded all units of
accommodation at the Original Villages at an average estimated cost of approximately £50,000 per lodge. Following
the upgrade of all existing units of accommodation, Center Parcs has started a cycle of refurbishment for such
accommodation which is important to maintain quality and generate repeat business, with approximately 300 to 400
units of accommodation refurbished annually.

There is also capacity for additional new builds of premium lodges at Center Parcs’ villages, which typically
achieve a premium over the rate achieved on standard lodges. Center Parcs believes that such premium lodges attract
affluent guests who are more likely to be high on-site spenders. Center Parcs currently has planning permission to
build a further 85 units of accommodation. The new units of accommodation are expected to include waterside lodges,
apartments and other executive lodges.

**Disciplined investment in village experience.**

Center Parcs believes that there are several substantial development projects that could profitably expand
Center Parcs’ offering, including Project Atlantis, which involves the strategic enhancement of the signature subtropical swimming paradise that features at each village. Center Parcs spent approximately £46 million between 2012
and 2023 on implementing Project Atlantis. Improvements included the addition of a new raft ride, the Tropical
Cyclone at Whinfell Forest, and a new play area featuring numerous slides and water features at Elveden Forest,
Longleat Forest and Sherwood Forest. Center Parcs has also invested approximately £6.5 million in the refurbishment
and expansion of the Aqua Sana spa facility at Longleat Forest and has recently finished a planned refurbishment of
the Aqua Sana spa facility at Elveden Forest at an estimated investment of £8.6 million. The Aqua Sana spa at Elveden
reopened in the second quarter of 2024.

Center Parcs also intends to introduce new leisure activities at each village on a regular basis, as well as
innovate upon its existing offering of leisure activities. Development opportunities include introducing zip wires,
electric boats and expanding indoor climbing activities to all villages. Center Parcs believes that such investments
provide an enriched holiday experience particularly for the affluent families that form its core guest base, and that an
improved on-site unique offering helps to drive both accommodation and on-site revenue.

During the closure of Center Parcs’ villages as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs reduced
capital expenditure by ceasing and rephasing non-essential capital projects as closures were announced. See “—
_Strategy—Continue to increase profitability through controlling costs”._

**Grow on-site spend.**

As Center Parcs’ guests typically remain on-site for the duration of their stay, Center Parcs believes that there
are opportunities to further grow on-site spend further. For example, Center Parcs has continued to develop a
programme of enhanced differentiation in pricing where prices of various offerings are expected to become flexible
across seasons, days of the week and times of day to more accurately reflect guest demand.

Center Parcs has franchise, licensing and concession agreements with various providers. These concession
partners enable guests to benefit from high street brand offerings and Center Parcs to increase profitability through
increased on-site spend. Center Parcs reviews these agreements periodically to ensure that they remain economically
attractive and meet its guests’ requirements.

-----

While on-site spend as a proportion of total revenue decreased to 35.4% in financial year 2022 due to COVID19 restrictions in the beginning of the period, after the lifting of COVID-19 related restrictions in the UK in 2022, onsite spend recovered to 38.3% of Center Parcs’ total revenue from on-site spend in the financial year 2023.

**Continue to increase profitability through controlling costs.**

Center Parcs benefits from having a flexible cost base. Because of the high level of forward booking visibility
of the business, Center Parcs is typically able to manage its cost base effectively to meet its business requirements.
For example, in light of the current rising cost of living environment in the UK, Center Parcs believes it is equipped
to reduce operating hours and optimise staff schedules across its food and beverage offerings and leisure activities to
reduce variable costs when forward booking information indicates a reduced number of guests or decreases in on-site
spending.

Center Parcs also hedges a large portion of its short-term energy requirements, reducing the effect of energy
market volatility on its operational costs. As part of the strategy to seek profitable growth, it intends to continue to
generate cost savings through increased efficiency at each village and at its head office.

During the closure of Center Parcs’ villages, Center Parcs ensured stringent cost controls and implemented
strict cash management procedures to reduce capital expenditure and conserve liquidity, including the rephasing of
capital investment projects and cessation of non-essential operating activities as closures were announced. Center
Parcs estimates that approximately 37.2% of its total capital expenditure for financial year 2021 was rephased. In
addition, Center Parcs also participated in a number of UK government support measures for businesses to reduce the
impact of the closures on its liquidity.

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**

**Current trading**

As of 21 March 2024, bookings for financial year 2025 were 39% sold, in line with bookings for financial
year 2024 as at the same point in March 2023. As of 18 April 2024, 45% of bookings for financial year 2025 were
sold.

EBITDA for the 52-week period ended 21 March 2024 was £275.4 million, as compared to £279.0 million
for the corresponding period ended 23 March 2023.

_The financial information as of and for the 52-week period ended 21 March 2024 (and the corresponding_
_comparative period) has not been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and has not been_
_audited or reviewed. Moreover, as certain year-end procedures were not performed in preparing the financial_
_information as of and for the 52-week period ended 21 March 2024 (and the corresponding comparative period), it_

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**Issuance of the Offered Notes, repayment of the Class B4 Loan and redemption of the Class B4 Notes**

On the Ninth Closing Date, the Issuer expects to issue £330,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Class
B7 Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2055 (the “Class B7 Notes” or the “Offered Notes”). Subject to the terms of the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer will make available to the Borrowers on the Ninth Closing Date
a secured term loan Class B7 facility in an aggregate principal amount of £330,000,000 (the “Class B7 Facility” and
the advance thereunder, the “Class B7 Loan”).

The Issuer will apply £250,000,000 of the proceeds of the issue of the Offered Notes to make the Class B7
Loan available to CPH3 under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. CPH3 will use the proceeds of the Class

borrower of the Class B4 Loan, which in turn will subscribe at a premium for ordinary shares in its direct subsidiaries,
CP Elveden Village Limited, CP Sherwood Village Limited and CP Whinfell Village Limited (which are all existing
borrowers of the Class B4 Loan); (b) CP Longleat Village Limited, which in turn will subscribe at a premium for
ordinary shares in its direct subsidiary, Longleat Property Limited; and (c) CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited

-----

“Subscriptions”) to enable each Class B4 Borrower to repay to the Issuer its respective portion of the Class B4 Loan,
which will in turn enable the Issuer to fund the redemption in full of the Class B4 Notes (but not including the payment
of accrued and unpaid interest). The remaining £80,000,000 of the proceeds of the Class B7 Loan will be applied
towards funding a distribution to shareholders (the “Distribution”) and paying fees, costs and expenses in connection
with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.”

On or about the Ninth Closing Date, the Issuer will redeem the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
£250,000,000 of the Class B4 Notes at a redemption price of 100.000% of the principal amount of such Class B4
Notes redeemed, which is the redemption price applicable to the Class B4 Notes on or after 28 August 2022. Proceeds
of the Class B7 Loan in the amount of £250,000,000 will be used to prepay a corresponding portion of the principal
amount of the Class B4 Loan (but not including any accrued and unpaid interest) so as to enable a redemption by the
Issuer of a corresponding portion of the Class B4 Notes. The payment of the accrued and unpaid interest up to the date
of prepayment will be funded from other funds available to the Third Initial Borrowers. The Issuer will apply the
proceeds of such prepayment to redeem the Class B4 Notes in full on or about the Ninth Closing Date. The redemption
of the Class B4 Notes is referred to in this Offering Memorandum as the “Refinancing”.

The issuance of the Class B7 Notes, and the use of proceeds therefrom, including the Refinancing and the
Distribution, are collectively referred to in this Offering Memorandum as the “Transactions”.

B7 Notes on the corresponding Note Interest Payment Date. If on any
Note Interest Payment Date, the amount received by the Issuer in respect
of a payment of interest on the Class B7 Loan is not sufficient to pay the
interest accrued on the Class B7 Notes, during the immediately preceding
Note Interest Period in full, the amount of interest accrued up to any such
Note Interest Payment Date that is not paid by the Issuer on such Note
Interest Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred
interest, being a “Deferred Interest Amount”) and such Deferred
Interest Amount shall continue to accrue interest at the then applicable
Class B7 Note Interest Rate, as relevant, until it is paid by the Issuer in
full.

If on any Loan Interest Payment Date:

(i) the Issuer receives a payment of interest on the Class B7 Loan
from the Borrowers in accordance with the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in excess of the amount of
interest accrued on the Class B7 Notes during the immediately
preceding Note Interest Period; and

16


-----

(ii) on such Note Interest Payment Date, a Deferred Interest Amount
in respect of any prior Note Interest Period remains outstanding,

then the Issuer shall apply such excess to reduce the then outstanding
Deferred Interest Amount. Interest and the aggregate amount of all
Deferred Interest Amounts then unpaid on the Class B7 Notes and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable by the Issuer
in pounds sterling on the Class B7 Note Final Maturity Date.

**_Interest on the Class B7 Loan: ................_** % per annum from (and including) the Ninth Closing Date up to (but

excluding) the Loan Interest Payment Date falling in August 2029 (the
“Class B7 Loan Step-Down Date”) and, thereafter,    % per annum
(each, as applicable, a “Class B7 Interest Rate”).

From (and including) the Class B7 Loan Expected Maturity Date, interest
will accrue on the Class B7 Loan at the applicable Class B7 Interest Rate
until (but excluding) the Class B Loan Final Maturity Date) but such
accruing interest will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest
being a “Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amount”) and such Class
B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amount will accrue interest at the applicable
Class B7 Interest Rate until paid by the Borrowers in full. On each Loan
Interest Payment Date, interest accrued on the Class B7 Loan Deferred
Interest Amount during the immediately preceding Loan Interest Period
will be added to the then outstanding Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest
Amount and thereafter paid at the times and in the same manner as the
Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amount. The Class B7 Loan Deferred
Interest Amount and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon will be
payable by the Borrowers only on the earlier of (x) the date on which the
Class A Loans are repaid in full (the “Initial Payment Date”) and (y) the
Class B7 Note Final Maturity Date; provided that if on the Initial
Payment Date, the Borrowers do not have sufficient cash to pay the Class
B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon in full on such date in accordance with the Borrower Priorities of
Payments, any unpaid Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon will not fall due then but will continue
to be deferred and will only fall due for payment on any subsequent Loan
Interest Payment Date to the extent of the cash available to the Borrowers
for such purpose determined in accordance with the Borrower Priorities
of Payments.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Class B7 Loan, any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon, any Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amounts
and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon may be repaid prior to the
Class B7 Note Final Maturity Date if (i) the Borrowers receive New
Equity Funds (as defined in “Description of the Class B7 Loan”), (ii) the
Topco Security is enforced and proceeds thereof are available for this
purpose and/or (iii) the Transaction Security is enforced and funds are
available for this purpose pursuant to the applicable Priorities of
Payments as described under “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement”, and the Issuer will be_
required to make the corresponding payments of interest on the Class B7
Notes using the proceeds of such payments made by (directly or
indirectly, or on behalf of) the Borrowers.

**_Cash Lock-Up: ........................................._** If at any time the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is not satisfied

(including if the Class A FCF DSCR falls below 135%) then no payments
(including payments of interest) may be made in respect of the Class B
Loans and, consequently, the Class B Notes, unless funded out of new

17

equity. See “Description of other Indebtedness — Class A
_Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement”._

**_Class B7 Note Interest Payment Dates: .._** Semi-annually in each year on 28 February and 28 August, subject to

adjustment for non-Business Days commencing on 28 August 2024 (the
“Note Interest Payment Dates” and each, a “Note Interest Payment
**Date”).**

**_Class B7 Loan Interest Payment Dates: ._** Each day falling three Business Days prior to a Note Interest Payment

Date (the “Loan Interest Payment Dates” and each a “Loan Interest
**Payment Date”).**

**_Security for the Class B7 Notes: .............._** The Class B7 Notes will be secured on a subordinated basis by firstranking security in respect of substantially all of the Issuer’s property and
assets, which also secures the Class A Notes, including the Issuer’s rights
against each Obligor under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement, the Borrower Deed of Charge (including the security trusts
created thereunder), the Woburn Deed of Charge (including the security
trusts created thereunder), the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Cash
Management Agreement, the Issuer English Corporate Services
Agreement, the Issuer Jersey Corporate Services Agreement, the Issuer
Account Bank Agreement and the Agency Agreement and its rights in
respect of its bank accounts and “Eligible Investments”. In addition, the
Class B7 Notes will have the benefit of the Topco Security created under
the Topco Security Documents in favour of the Borrower Security
Trustee. For details of the security for the Class B7 Notes, see “Terms
_and Conditions of the Class B Notes — Condition 2.2 (Security).”_

**_Security for the Class B7 Loan: .............._** The Class B7 Loan will be secured on a subordinated basis by firstranking security in respect of, among other things, all of the Obligors’
right, title and interest in its assets pursuant to the Borrower Deed of
Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge and have the benefit of security
interests created by the Topco Security Documents.

The Class B7 Loan will share security with, among others, the Class A
Loans, the Liquidity Facility and certain hedging arrangements; provided
that the Class B7 Loan ranks junior to the foregoing with respect to the
application of enforcement proceeds, other than in respect of the Topco
Security.

The shared security package includes first ranking mortgages or fixed
charges of, among other things, the freehold and leasehold interests in the
properties which are owned by the Obligors and fixed or floating charges
over all other property, undertakings and assets of each Obligor. In
addition, each Obligor has granted a first-ranking legal mortgage over the
shares it owns in any English Obligor. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements — Borrower Security Documents — Borrower_
_Deed of Charge” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements_
_— Borrower Security Documents — Woburn Deed of Charge”._


**_Topco Payment Undertaking; Topco_**
**_Security: ..................................................._**


Pursuant to an amended and restated deed of undertaking to be entered
into on the Ninth Closing Date between the Issuer, Topco, CP Opco and
the Borrower Security Trustee, Topco undertakes to procure the payment
of an amount equal to the aggregate of (a) the then principal balance of
the Class B Loans; (b) accrued and unpaid interest outstanding in respect
of the Class B Loans; and (c) all other amounts outstanding under the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (the “Topco Payment
**Undertaking”) in the specified circumstances described therein. The**
Borrowers are obliged to use such amount to prepay a corresponding

18


-----

amount of the Class B Loans and the Issuer will then redeem a
corresponding amount of Class B Notes. Further details in respect of this
deed are set out in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —
_Topco Payment Undertaking”._

The obligations of Topco under the Topco Payment Undertaking are
secured in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee with (a) a mortgage,
charge and other security interests granted by Topco over the shares of
CP Cayman Limited, together with a floating charge granted over all of
Topco’s other assets pursuant to a share security agreement, entered into
on the Third Closing Date (the “Topco Share Security Agreement”) and
(b) a pledge granted by CP Cayman Limited over the shares of Center
Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited together with a floating charge over all of CP
Cayman Limited’s other assets pursuant to a security agreement entered
into on the Fourth Closing Date (the “CP Cayman Security
**Agreement”). The security interests created under the Topco Share**
Security Agreement, the CP Cayman Security Agreement and the other
Topco Security Documents constitutes the “Topco Security”. The
Class A Notes and the Class A Loans do not have the benefit of the Topco
Payment Undertaking and the security interests created under the Topco
Security Documents.

Further details in respect of these agreements are set out in “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement”,_
_“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Topco Share_
_Security Agreement” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements — CP Cayman Security Agreement”._

**_Optional and mandatory redemption of the The Class B7 Notes will be pass-through notes and will be subject to_**
**_Class B7 Notes: ........................................_** mandatory redemption prior to the Class B7 Note Final Maturity Date if

and to the extent that CPH3 makes principal repayments or prepayments
to the Issuer in respect of the Class B7 Loan, either at the option of the
Borrowers or following any enforcement of the Topco Share Security or
the Transaction Security.

Any such redemption of the Class B7 Notes will be on the same terms
and at the same prices (including any applicable premium) as for the
prepayment of the Class B7 Loan.

It is expected that, because of the terms of the Topco Payment
Undertaking and the Topco Security Documents, CPH3 will elect to
prepay the Class B7 Loan on or before the Class B7 Loan Expected
Maturity Date, but it is not obliged to do so and the Issuer is therefore not
obliged to redeem the Class B7 Notes on the Class B7 Note Expected
Maturity Date.

At any time on or after 28 August 2026, the Class B7 Loans will be
prepayable at the option of CPH3, in whole or in part, at the purchase
prices set out in “Description of the Class B7 Loan— Prepayment —
_Optional Prepayment”._

At any time prior to 28 August 2026, the Borrowers may prepay some or
all of the Class B7 Loans at a prepayment price equal to 100% of their
principal amount outstanding plus (i) accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, and (ii) a make-whole premium as specified
in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

Prior to 28 August 2026, the Borrowers may prepay up to 10% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the Class B7 Loan in each

19


-----

**_Mandatory offers to Purchase for Class B_**
**_Change of Control and Asset Sales: ........_**


calendar year at a prepayment price equal to 103% of the principal
amount of the Class B7 Loan prepaid.

In addition, prior to 28 August 2026, the Borrowers may on one or more
occasions use the net proceeds of specified equity offerings to prepay up
to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Class B7 Loan, at a
purchase price equal to    % of the aggregate principal amount of the
Class B7 Loan, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts,
if any, up to the prepayment date, provided that at least 50% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the Class B7 Loan in issue remains
outstanding after the prepayment.

The funds received by the Issuer from the prepayment of the Class B7
Loan will be used by the Issuer to redeem a corresponding principal
amount of outstanding Class B7 Notes in accordance with the Class B
Conditions. See “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes — Condition
_5 (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation)”._

The terms of the asset sales covenant in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement requires the Borrowers to use certain of the proceeds of
certain asset sales to either invest in additional assets or repay certain
other indebtedness, and if they do not, to use such excess proceeds since
such asset sale to make an offer to repurchase the Class B Notes at a
repurchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amount, if any, any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon and additional amounts, if any, to the
date of purchase.

Following a Class B Change of Control (as defined in the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) with respect to the Class B7 Notes,
the Borrowers will be required to offer to repurchase all or any part of the
Class B7 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Class B7 Loan Deferred
Interest Amount, if any, any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. See “Description of
_the Class B7 Loan”._


**_Tender Offers: .........................................._** In connection with any tender offer, Class B Change of Control Offer or

Asset Sale Offer for the Class B7 Notes, if not less than 90 per cent. in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B7 Notes are
validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and purchased pursuant to
such offer by the Borrowers, the Borrowers may prepay the remaining
principal amount of the Class B7 Loan, in whole but not in part, at a price
equal to the purchase price offered to holders of the Class B7 Notes
pursuant to such offer (which may be less than par) and the Issuer will be
required to apply the proceeds received from such prepayment to redeem
a corresponding principal amount of Class B7 Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, at a
redemption price corresponding to the prepayment price. See
“Description _of_ _the_ _Class_ _B7_ _Loan—_ _Prepayment—Optional_
_Prepayment”._


**_Early redemption for tax and other_**
**_reasons: ...................................................._**


The Class B7 Notes and the Class B7 Loan may be redeemed or repaid
at the option of the Issuer, in whole but not in part, at any time following
certain changes in tax laws and/or other laws at a price equal to 100% of
their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest
amounts, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, and
additional amounts if any, provided certain conditions are satisfied,

20

including that the Issuer has sufficient funds to make such redemption or
repayment. See “Description of the Class B7 Loan— Taxes — Repayment
_for Tax Reasons” and “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes —_
_Condition 5 (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation)”._

**_Class B7 Loan Financial Covenant: ......._** Under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Obligors are

required to maintain a ratio (expressed as a percentage) of free cash flow
to total debt service charges (the “Class B FCF DSCR”) equal to at least
100% on each Financial Covenant Test Date.

The Obligors will have the benefit of certain cure rights in the event that
the Class B FCF DSCR is less than 100%. See “Description of the Class
_B7 Loan”._

**_Certain other Class B7 Loan covenants:_** The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement limits, among other

things, Topco and the Obligors with respect to:

                    - the incurrence or guarantee of additional indebtedness;

                    - the payment of dividends or other distributions on, and the
redemption or repurchase of, its equity;

                    - the making of certain restricted payments and investments;

                    - the incurrence of certain liens;

                    - the imposition of restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay
dividends and other payments to members of the Group;

                    - the transfer, lease, sale or other disposition of certain assets;

                    - the merger, consolidation with, or sale of substantially all of the
Group’s assets to, other entities;

                    - the entry into certain transactions with affiliates; and

                    - the impairment of the security interest for the holders of Class
B Notes.

Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and
qualifications. See “Description of the Class B7 Loan”.

**_Events of Default: ...................................._** No Class B Note Event of Default or Class B Loan Event of Default may

occur with respect to the Class B Notes or any Class B Loans while the
Class A Notes or Class A Loans are outstanding (until after an
acceleration of the Class A Notes or Class A Loans, respectively).
However, the Class B Noteholders have the ability to demand repayment
by Topco pursuant to the Topco Payment Undertaking and direct the
Borrower Security Trustee to enforce the security granted pursuant to the
Topco Security Documents upon the occurrence of any Share
Enforcement Event.

**_Share Enforcement Event: ......................_** Each of the following will constitute a Share Enforcement Event under

the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, among others:

                    - any default in the payment of interest or additional amounts, if
any, on a Class B Loan (subject to a 30-day grace period);

                    - any amount remaining outstanding under a Class B Loan at the
close of business on the Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date
of such Class B Loan;

21


-----

                    - any failure to pay principal or premium on a Class B Loan upon
any optional redemption, required repurchase or declaration;

                    - any failure to comply with the covenant described under the
headings “Description of the Class B7 Loan—Class B Change
_of Control” (other than a failure to purchase Class B Notes_
which will constitute a Share Enforcement Event per the above)
(subject to 30 day grace period);

                    - any failure to comply with the covenant described under the
heading “Description of the Class B7 Loan— Certain Covenants
_— Limitation on Holding Company Activities”;_

                    - any failure to comply with certain other covenants under Class
B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (subject to a 60-day grace
period);

                    - default under any indebtedness that results from a failure to pay
principal when due or results in acceleration of such
indebtedness (subject to a £25.0 million threshold);

                    - certain bankruptcy events of default;

                    - certain judgment defaults (subject to a £25.0 million threshold
and 60-day grace period);

                    - any impairment of the security interest granted in respect of
material collateral (subject to a 10-business day grace period);
and

                    - any impairment of a guarantee.

If a Share Enforcement Event occurs and is continuing, the Borrower
Security Trustee acting upon instructions of the Issuer Security Trustee
as directed by the Class B Note Trustee, who shall be required to act if
directed by the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Class B Notes, will be able to enforce the Topco Security,
subject to certain requirements being met. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements —Intercreditor” and “Description of the Class_
_B7 Loan — Share Enforcement Event” and “Risk Factors – Risks_
_Relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency - The Borrower_
_Security Trustee will only enforce the Borrower Security if it is instructed_
_to do so by the requisite percentage of Class A Noteholders or Class B_
_Noteholders, as the case may be.”_

If at any time either (i) no amounts remain outstanding under any Class A
Notes or (ii) an acceleration of the amounts outstanding under any
Class A Loans has occurred, each of the Share Enforcement Events
specified above will also constitute a Class B Loan Event of Default.

**_Withholding tax on Notes: ......................._** All payments in respect of the Class B7 Notes will be made without

withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes,
levies, duties, imposts, assessments or charges of whatsoever nature
unless the Issuer or any Paying Agent is required by applicable law to
make any payment in respect of the Class B7 Notes subject to any such
withholding or deduction.

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any taxes imposed
or levied by or on behalf of a relevant tax jurisdiction will at any time be
required to be made from any payments made in respect to the Class B7
Notes, including payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price,

interest or premium, the Issuer will, subject to certain exceptions, be
obliged to pay additional amounts in respect of any such withholding or
deduction, such that the net amount received by the holders of the Class
B7 Notes is not less than the amount they would have received in the
absence of such withholding.

(a) Center Parcs does not calculate taxation for interim periods.

(b) Center Parcs defines EBITDA as profit/(loss) for the period attributable to equity shareholders before interest, taxation, depreciation
and amortisation. EBITDA is not a measure under IFRS and investors should not consider EBITDA as an alternative to (a) operating
profit or profit/(loss) for the period as a measure of Center Parcs’ operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and
financing activities as a measure of Center Parcs’ ability to meet its cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance under IFRS.
Investors should evaluate each adjustment and the reasons Center Parcs considers it appropriate as a method of supplemental analysis.
In evaluating EBITDA, investors should be aware that, as an analytical tool, EBITDA is subject to certain limitations. See “Presentation
_of Financial Information — Non-IFRS Financial Measures”. In addition, investors should be aware that Center Parcs is likely to incur_
expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation in the future and that certain of these items could be considered recurring in
nature.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Offered Notes involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the_
_following risk factors and the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum before making an investment_
_decision. The risks described below are not the only ones the Center Parcs Group faces. Additional risks not presently_
_known to the Center Parcs Group or that it currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business._
_If any such risks or any other matters or unforeseen events actually occur, Center Parcs’ business, financial condition_
_and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In any of such cases, the value of the Offered Notes_
_could decline, and the Center Parcs Group may not be able to pay all or part of the interest or principal on the Offered_
_Notes and investors may lose all or part of their investment. Further, to the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic_
_adversely affects Center Parcs Group’s business and its results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening_
_many of the other risks described in this section. This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements_
_that involve risks and uncertainties. The Center Parcs Group’s actual results could differ materially from those_
_anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by the Center_
_Parcs Group described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**RISKS RELATING TO CENTER PARCS’ BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY**

**_Economic and geopolitical events and conditions, including inflation, higher interest rates and political instability,_**
**_particularly in England, may affect Center Parcs’ revenues, operating costs and profitability._**

Center Parcs’ business is sensitive to unfavourable or uncertain economic conditions, economic contraction
or recession, the perception by Center Parcs’ guests of weak or weakening economic conditions and the corresponding
impacts on discretionary consumer spending, particularly in the UK. Center Parcs has also been and may continue to
be impacted by adverse perceived or actual changes in the economic climate, such as global or regional recessions,
higher unemployment and underemployment rates, increases in the cost of living and declines in income levels. Higher
energy prices and supply disruptions, including as a result of Russia’s war in Ukraine, have resulted in high inflation,
including in the UK, and have contributed to higher operating costs for Center Parcs. Inflation rates also outstripped
wages and benefit increases in 2022 and 2023. While the annual Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’
housing costs inflation rate in the UK decreased from 9.2% for the twelve months ended December 2022, to 4.2% for
the twelve months ended February 2024, it remains above recent historical levels. In response to the high inflation
rates, central banks in major economies, including the Bank of England, increased interest rates in 2022 and 2023.
Even if inflation rates were to fall gradually in 2024, there would still be a possibility of further interest rate increases
in 2024 and beyond or that interest rates remain higher than recent historical rates. Any further increase in interest
rates or inflation, or a sustained period of high interest rates and/or high inflation, may result in, among other things,
an increase in Center Parcs’ operational expenses, including with respect to wages and salaries.

The villages have certain fixed operating costs and, as a result, decreases in revenue may result in a significant
decline in net cash flow, as seen during the periods when Center Parcs’ villages were closed in response to the COVID19 pandemic. In addition, a significant or sustained decline in economic conditions or high rates of inflation could
adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to obtain goods and services from suppliers or credit from financing sources and
could impact the ability of third parties, including insurance carriers and credit providers, to meet their obligations to
Center Parcs. Weak economic conditions generally in the UK, including the current cost of living crisis, any decrease
in the disposable income of Center Parcs’ guests and decreasing consumer confidence, or in any regional market from
which a particular village attracts guests, may adversely affect holiday centre occupancy and guest spending patterns.
For example, guests may opt for less expensive food and beverage options or arrive with their own groceries rather
than using Center Parcs’ range of food and beverage options and book fewer on-site activities, or there may be less
demand for higher-value accommodations. The villages of the Obligor Group are all located in England and,
consequently, Center Parcs’ revenue and profit could be substantially influenced by general economic conditions in
England, in particular.

Even if economic conditions are stable or improving, a negative economic outlook, including the fear of a
recession and/or concerns regarding falling living standards, may adversely affect consumer spending and, as a result,
have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, if
general economic conditions in the UK were to improve significantly, there may be greater consumer preference for
holidays abroad.

On 31 January 2020, the UK formally left the European Union (“Brexit”). Brexit may exacerbate the
economic downturn in the UK. Uncertainty surrounding Brexit also led to a decrease in the exchange rate of the pound

EUROPE LEGAL 288904189/4 166017 0014/4 166017 0014 36


-----

sterling against the euro and continued or sustained adverse effects on the exchange rate of the pound sterling as
compared to foreign currencies. The effective price inflation of certain goods and services sourced from outside of the
UK as a result of the changes in exchange rates, as well as increased costs of importation as a result of additional
customs checks, transportation costs, taxes and duties, has resulted in increased costs for Center Parcs.

Center Parcs has been, and may continue to be, impacted by political instability in the UK and its
corresponding effects on the UK economy. Since 2022, the UK government has experienced a high turnover of cabinet
ministers, including three prime ministers. Public perception of political instability in the UK and the corresponding
uncertainty in monetary and fiscal policy as a result of such rapid transitions in government leadership has had negative
impacts on the UK economy. Further instability in UK politics and other similar events that lead to the weakening of
economic conditions in the UK may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business and results of operations.

Terrorist attacks have created many economic and political uncertainties. Center Parcs cannot predict the
extent to which terrorism or security alerts may directly or indirectly impact demand for its holiday parks, or otherwise
impact its business and operating results. The occurrence of any such terrorist event near or at a village could have a
material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations

**_Center Parcs derives its revenue from operating its villages. Any failure to manage its villages effectively or any_**
**_significant business interruption or other event affecting the operation of one or more of its villages may have a_**
**_material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Center Parcs operates five holiday villages in England. Any significant business interruption at any of its
villages, such as the closure of the holiday villages for extended periods in financial years 2020 and 2021 as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic, may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, unexpected closures with short notice to Center Parcs’ guests, like the one-day closure of onsite activities and certain guest facilities at all five holiday villages on 19 September 2022 for the funeral of Queen
Elizabeth II, may negatively affect customer expectations and result in further cancellations which may have a material
adverse effect on Center Parcs’ financial condition and results of operations.

Although Center Parcs has risk management arrangements, including business continuity plans, in place,
such risk management arrangements, or any insurance may not adequately protect Center Parcs from significant
interruption of business at any one or more of the villages. In addition, Center Parcs may not be able to obtain planning
permission or planning consent to rebuild properties if destroyed, regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds.
A significant interruption or event could be created by any number of internal or external factors, including fire (as
occurred at the Elveden village in 2002, resulting in a 15-month closure), extreme weather conditions (as occurred
during Storm Eunice in February 2022, resulting in closures at Longleat, Woburn, Elveden and Sherwood), accidents,
loss of utilities or other interruptions, such as the COVID-19 or similar pandemic. Due to the full service, selfcontained nature of its villages, Center Parcs maintains significant infrastructure, including water supply, electricity
and waste water treatment, and any failure to adequately develop and maintain these facilities could also result in a
significant business interruption. Such interruptions and events may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’
business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely
affected by a number of factors relating to the operation of any village or the guest perception or expectation of the
operating activities in a particular village. Factors that relate specifically to a particular village could include, amongst
others:

      - the age, design, construction quality and maintenance of the village;

      - perceptions regarding the attractiveness of the village;

      - the proximity and attractiveness of competing UK holiday centres;

      - the proximity of other developments and infrastructure projects, for example, power stations or road
projects, which adversely impacts guest experiences;

      - increases in operating expenses;

      - inability to pass on to guests any significant unforeseen input costs, such as utility costs, that would
erode Center Parcs’ margins;

37


-----

      - an increase in the capital expenditure needed to maintain the village or make improvements, or to
maintain the competitiveness of the villages;

      - an outbreak of a notifiable illness, food poisoning or drinking water contamination at any village;

      - major village damage or disruption including natural or environmental disasters;

      - bad or extreme weather conditions;

      - an illness, disease or event that damages the forest, fauna and natural environment surrounding a
village;

      - guest health and safety issues, such as inadequate or untimely first aid responses, accidents or
fatalities, personal injuries or child abuse or abduction;

      - burglaries or thefts of personal belongings from village accommodation or facilities;

      - a fluctuation or decline, seasonal or otherwise, in demand for the facilities that the village offers;

      - increases in development and construction costs or delays in completion schedules;

      - disturbances to guests’ experiences caused by new build, maintenance or refurbishment projects;
and

      - negative publicity or guest perceptions about any village due to the above-mentioned factors or
otherwise.

Center Parcs’ effective management and operation of the villages has a significant impact on the revenues,
expenses and value of the villages. Any failure to manage Center Parcs’ operations effectively, including any failure
to anticipate and react to the above-mentioned factors may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Governmental regulation may adversely affect Center Parcs’ existing and future operations and results._**

Center Parcs is subject to various national and local regulations that have affected, and will continue to affect,
its operations. Each of its holiday villages is subject to national and local licensing and regulation by health, sanitation,
food and workplace safety, and other agencies. For example, Center Parcs was adversely impacted by governmental
efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, including stay-at-home measures and social distancing requirements. Its
operations are also subject to regulations which govern such matters as the minimum wage, national living wage,
overtime and other working conditions, along with parental leave and a variety of similar laws enacted to govern these
and other employment law matters.

The UK government introduced a national living wage in the 2015 budget, which has applied to employees
aged 25 and over starting in April 2016, and includes further phased increases in April of every year. Since
introduction, Center Parcs has always paid above the national living wage to all employees, including employees
under the age of 25. As of 1 April 2024, the national living wage increased from £10.42 per hour to £11.44 per hour.
This increase in wages resulted in higher personnel costs and is expected to result in further increase in personnel costs
going forward. Changes to such laws and regulations, including further increases to the minimum wage or national
living wage, could have a materially adverse impact on Center Parcs’ existing and future operations and results.

Center Parcs is also subject to the Equality Act 2010, which gives civil rights protections to individuals with
disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodation and other areas. Center Parcs may in the future have
to modify its villages or policies to provide services to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. The
expenses associated with these modifications could be material. Regulations and laws, or the way in which they are
interpreted, may become more stringent over time, which could require new capital expenditures and result in an
increase in its operating costs.

**_Center Parcs’ business depends on the public perception of its brand. Any event at any village negatively affecting_**
**_guest perception or expectation will likely negatively affect guest perception of the other Center Parcs villages._**

The success of Center Parcs’ business depends on the public perception of the Center Parcs brand. Any event
or occurrence at any one village that negatively affects guest perceptions is likely to negatively affect guest perceptions
of all Center Parcs villages. Center Parcs villages feature activities such as water activities, paintballing, laser combat,

38


-----

horse riding, abseiling, zip wiring and quadbiking that pose a potential risk of accident and serious personal injury or
death. Furthermore, injuries, including fatal injuries, can and have occurred amongst guests and staff while on-site. If
a fatal or other serious personal injury or an outbreak of a notifiable illness, food poisoning or drinking water
contamination were to occur at one of the holiday villages, attendance at the holiday villages and, consequently,
revenues might be materially adversely affected. In addition, holidays at Center Parcs’ villages involve guest services
and guest interactions, including with respect to bookings, accommodation services, on-site activities and food and
beverage provisions. A pattern of poor or unsatisfactory guest service, guest complaints or poor reviews on social
media at any of the villages could result in reputational harm to the Center Parcs brand. The considerable expansion
in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope and speed of the negative publicity
that could be generated by such incidents or events. Any accident, interruption, serious disturbance or negative
publicity at Center Parcs’ holiday villages, or a perception that the facilities are unsafe or operate in an unsafe manner,
may reduce attendance at or demand for its holiday villages, which would have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial condition and results of operations.

If any such accidents or injuries do occur, Center Parcs’ insurance may not adequately cover the costs
stemming from such accidents and injuries or other disturbances and incidents. Center Parcs could also face legal
claims related to these events, as well as adverse publicity that could be generated by such incidents. Accidents or
injuries could also require upgrades, modifications or demolition of affected facilities, which could result in significant
costs to Center Parcs and disrupt operations, which could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Center Parcs sells food and beverages, toys and other retail products, the sale of which involves legal and
other risks. As a reseller of food and retail merchandise, Center Parcs may be liable if the consumption or purchase of
any of the products it sells causes illness or injury. Furthermore, any product recall could result in losses due to the
cost of the recall, the destruction of product and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. A
significant food, toy, gift or other retail product recall could also result in adverse publicity, damage to Center Parcs’
reputation and loss of consumer confidence in its villages, which could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Center Parcs actively manages pricing across its villages to maintain its high level of occupancy and to
optimise yields during periods of high demand. With the increasing prevalence of flexible pricing in other industries
such as retail, food, live events and transportation, there has been greater public scrutiny of demand-based pricing,
which could potentially adversley impact the reputation of companies that use forms of flexible pricing and may even
result in regulatory intervention on pricing practices.

Center Parcs targets affluent family-focused guests with historically approximately 80% of Center Parcs’
guests being families with children. In order to provide an environment that is attractive to this core group of guests,
Center Parcs strives to maintain a balanced guest profile of, amongst others, families, adult groups and corporate
events. If guests’ behaviour is disruptive or otherwise affects the enjoyment of other guests, this could result in adverse
publicity and damage to Center Parcs’ reputation. A failure to attract Center Parcs’ core demographic of affluent
guests with families could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial conditions and results
of operations. Longford Forest in the Republic of Ireland opened in 2019. Although Longford Forest is outside of the
Obligor Group, any incidents at Longford Forest such as those described above or consistent poor reviews could have
a negative impact on the perception of Center Parcs in general and therefore on its results of operations. In addition,
Center Parcs shares its brand with Center Parcs Holding B.V. and Center Parcs Europe N.V., who run holiday parks
in continental Europe, and any adverse perceptions of these holiday parks could affect Center Parcs’ brand and
reputation.

The successor to the founder of the Center Parcs brand is Center Parcs Holding B.V., a subsidiary of French
listed company Pierre & Vacances, which operates holiday businesses in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and
Germany. Under the terms of a brand sharing agreement relating to trademarks and marketing services with, among
others, CP Opco, Center Parcs Holding B.V. and Center Parcs Europe N.V. (“CP Continental Europe”), the parties
agreed that CP Opco is exclusively entitled to use the trademark registrations for the Center Parcs brand that it owns
in its territory (UK, the Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland) and CP Continental Europe is exclusively entitled
to use the trademark registrations for the Center Parcs brand that it owns in its territory (Albania, Austria, the Benelux
region, Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Macedonia, Monaco, Norway,
Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine). Under the

39


-----

brand sharing agreement, each party has exclusive rights to operate holiday centres in its respective territory using its
registered marks. Any event or circumstance that has an adverse impact on guest perceptions of the Center Parcs brand
and holiday business in continental Europe could have a material adverse effect on the reputation of the Center Parcs
brand in the UK.

**_Center Parcs competes for discretionary spending with other holiday offerings and holiday or leisure alternatives._**

The UK domestic holiday market is diverse. Center Parcs’ main competitors are high-end, self-catering
cottage accommodation and leisure hotels and resorts, primarily in the UK, and to a lesser extent abroad. Center Parcs’
holiday villages compete for guests’ discretionary spending with other holiday offerings, including other holiday
villages (both UK traditional holiday villages and holiday parks and UK and international destination parks). In
addition, other holiday providers could open forest villages in the UK in the future. A village’s ability to attract guests
depends, among other things, on the quality of the accommodation, competitiveness of prices, amenities and facilities
offered and the convenience and location of the village. If competing UK holiday centres provide a better offering to
guests, this may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations,
which may in turn affect the ability of the Obligors to meet their obligations under the Loans and the Issuer’s ability
to meet its obligations under the Notes. Since the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two-hour drive of the
village they choose to visit, the effects of competition would be more pronounced if a new holiday centre or other
guest attraction opened within close proximity to one of Center Parcs’ holiday villages or if an existing holiday centre
expanded into its market or began conducting activities aimed at capturing Center Parcs’ market share.

In addition, Center Parcs may face increased competition from holiday offerings outside the UK as a result
of an increase in the convenience or reduction in the cost of air travel, any appreciation of the pound relative to other
currencies, particularly the euro, or inclement weather in the UK. This may result in a material and adverse effect on
Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if macroeconomic conditions are
strong and/or inflation in the UK declines, there may be greater consumer preference for holidays abroad. Further,
Longford Forest in the Republic of Ireland, which is outside of the Obligor Group, may attract guests away from
Center Parcs’ UK villages. Reduced occupancy at Center Parcs’ existing villages for any of the above reasons may
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of Center Parcs.

Center Parcs also competes more broadly with other types of leisure activities and forms of entertainment,
such as sports and other recreational activities, restaurants, bars, retail outlets and spa facilities.

One or more of Center Parcs’ competitors for holiday or leisure activities may be more successful in attracting
and retaining guests. If Center Parcs does not compete successfully for discretionary spending with other holiday
villages and other leisure alternatives, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected.

**_Center Parcs could be adversely affected by changes in consumer tastes and expectations or its failure to maintain_**
**_and improve its villages and amenities to appeal to changing guest tastes and expectations._**

The success of Center Parcs’ holiday villages depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that
can change in unpredictable ways, and on Center Parcs’ ability to ensure that its holiday villages meet the changing
preferences of its target guests. Evolving standards of accommodation and amenities and changing guest expectations,
such as with regards to social distancing and personal protective equipment, may also affect the revenues and
popularity of Center Parcs’ villages, which require continued investment to ensure that the accommodation and
amenities in the villages are attractive and appeal to Center Parcs’ guests. Center Parcs carries out significant research
and analysis before constructing new holiday villages or opening new facilities at its villages and often invests
substantial amounts in investigating how these new holiday villages and new facilities may be perceived by guests. If
Center Parcs’ facilities or new entertainment and leisure activity offerings do not achieve targeted guest volumes,
revenues may decline. Any failure to invest, innovate or continue to improve Center Parcs’ offering in a timely manner
to meet changing consumer preferences or to retain long-term guest loyalty or provide satisfactory guest service may
have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Bad or extreme weather conditions, road, rail or other transportation disruptions or closures and other conditions_**
**_out of Center Parcs’ control could negatively affect occupancy at Center Parcs’ villages._**

Center Parcs’ holiday villages provide both indoor and outdoor activities, with the natural setting of the
villages and the outdoor activities a major draw for guests. However, bad weather or forecasts of bad or mixed weather
conditions can reduce the number of people who come to the holiday villages or who book stays, which may require

40


-----

Center Parcs to lower prices thus reducing ADR even if occupancy remains stable. In addition, due to the often
unexpected nature of bad or extreme weather conditions, Center Parcs may fail to predict or undertake the appropriate
advanced planning to maintain business operations in the event of a disruption due to bad or extreme weather
conditions. Any such condition could also adversely affect guests’ experiences during their stay at Center Parcs and
thereby affect their willingness to return to Center Parcs as repeat guests. Bad or extreme weather conditions (for
example, floods, storms, heatwaves or high winds) or other occurrences outside of Center Parcs’ control (such as fires)
could also lead to the loss of use of one or more of Center Parcs’ villages, or damage the natural environment in which
the villages are situated, and disrupt its ability to attract guests to certain of Center Parcs’ villages or facilities. Due to
such conditions or for other weather-related or environmental reasons, Center Parcs’ facilities and activities may close
from time to time. For example, as a result of red and amber weather warnings for high winds caused by storms across
England and Wales, indicating that there was danger to life and localised conditions, Center Parcs took the decision
to close four villages on 17 February 2022. While Sherwood Forest was reopened the next day, the Elveden Forest,
Longleat Forest & Woburn Forest villages were closed for a week due to storm damage. Affected guests were
refunded. While insurance covered the cost of damage to the villages, trading losses, including the cost of refunds,
were not covered and resulted in additional costs to Center Parcs.

The occurrence of extreme winter weather conditions could cause significant damage to Center Parcs’
holiday villages, which could materially and adversely affect its overall business. Similarly, unseasonably high
temperatures and high winds could exacerbate forest fires. In addition, prolonged drought conditions may cause water
shortages, which could adversely impact the operation of Center Parcs’ water amenities. Center Parcs’ insurance may
not be sufficient to cover the costs of repairing or replacing damaged property or equipment, and Center Parcs may
suffer a significant decline in revenues if any of its holiday villages is closed or unable to operate all of its facilities
for an extended period of time.

Road closures or detours as a result of bad weather conditions may also prevent or delay Center Parcs’ guests,
who primarily drive to the villages, from reaching the villages. Road closures and detours have the potential of
extending the effects of bad weather beyond the particular storm or weather condition as damaged roads and highways
may take significant time to repair. Additionally, road closures and detours as a result of non-weather factors, such as
government repair works, may also reduce the number of guests. If transport links to Center Parcs’ holiday villages
and related infrastructure are damaged or become inadequate, guests may face difficulty in traveling to the villages,
or may face significant delays and increased travel times, which could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs’ revenues are highest during school holidays and public holidays, which could magnify the impact_**
**_of adverse conditions or events that occur during peak demand periods._**

Center Parcs’ revenues are subject to seasonal factors and guest demand for breaks increases during school
holidays, public holidays and periods of expected favourable weather conditions, among other things, during which
Center Parcs is generally able to charge higher prices. As a result, if extreme weather, accidents or other adverse
conditions or events occur, particularly during peak holiday periods, Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and
results of operations may be materially adversely affected. For example, the Center Parcs’ villages were closed as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic during certain breaks which have historically been very profitable for Center Parcs,
including the Easter holidays, May half-term, Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Any changes in school holiday
schedules or a switch to a uniform year-round schedule could adversely affect Center Parcs’ guest bookings, and
consequently its attendance levels or target pricing levels during the peak holiday periods, which may adversely affect
Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in late 2023, the Welsh government
held a consulation regarding a shortening of the summer school holiday. Such changes in Wales or elsewhere in the
UK would have an impact on Center Parcs’ guest base. In addition, any such adverse effect or condition may make it
difficult for Center Parcs to predict its operating results, which may materially and adversely affect Center Parcs’
ability to implement planned capital expenditures.

In the UK, there has been an increasing trend of the government seeking to ban or deter term-time holidays
for school children. In 2017, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld fines, and local authorities continue to use fines,
penalising parents taking their children out of school during term-time in the absence of exceptional circumstances.
This may result in lower demand for Center Parcs’ villages during off-peak periods and cause Center Parcs to further
reduce off-peak prices, thereby decreasing margins.

**_Work stoppages, increased staff costs, and other employee problems could negatively impact Center Parcs’ future_**
**_profits._**

A lengthy strike or other work stoppage at one of the holiday villages could have an adverse effect on Center
Parcs’ business and results of operations. Center Parcs’ employees are not unionised, but some of Center Parcs’
employees are, or may in the future be, represented by works councils. Center Parcs may experience union activity in
the future which could negatively impact Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, staff costs are a primary cost component in operating Center Parcs. Increased staff costs, due to
competition for available workers, increases in inflation, increased minimum wage or employee benefit costs, changes
in labour laws or otherwise, could adversely impact Center Parcs’ operating expenses.

**_Instances of injuries, illness, epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, as well as negative publicity relating_**
**_thereto, could result in reduced guest attendance and materially and adversely impact Center Parcs’ business._**

In December 2019, the emergence of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and rapidly
spread across the world early in 2020. The outbreak resulted in government authorities and businesses throughout the
world implementing numerous measures intended to contain and limit the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans
and restrictions, quarantines, self-isolation, shelter-in-place and lockdown orders, business restrictions, shutdowns,
and other limitations. As a result of such measures, Center Parcs’ villages were closed for prolonged periods in
financial years 2020 and 2021. Despite the reopening of the villages by 12 April 2021, Center Parcs’ villages operated
under self-imposed restrictions and capacity limitations to reduce the risk of localised outbreaks for much of financial
year 2022. The effect of the global COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics or epidemics on Center Parcs’ business
and the wider hospitality industry will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the
effectiveness of vaccines in continuing to prevent outbreaks and decreasing hospitalisation and death rates, the
prevalence of further variants which may be more virulent, more infectious or less responsive to vaccines, and the
length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume.

The outbreak of any prolonged pandemic or epidemic disease, whether a further outbreak of COVID-19 or
any other disease, or the occurrence of any other public health concern could negatively impact the public’s
willingness to gather in public spaces or travel or result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions
on travel, which individually or together could reduce guest volumes or revenues at Center Parcs’ holiday villages. In
addition, any such public health concerns may severely restrict the level of economic activity in affected areas. Any
of these events, particularly if they occur during the peak holiday periods, or the booking periods thereof, could have
a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

Instances of fatalities, illness or injury, particularly an accident or an injury involving the safety of guests
and employees, or claims of illness relating to food or drinking water quality or handling at restaurants, food
preparation centres or holiday centres, whether or not affecting Center Parcs’ villages, or in relation to water quality
within pools and spas could reduce guest attendance materially, either through cancellations of existing bookings or
by reducing consumer willingness to visit Center Parcs. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may occur in the
future. In addition, any negative publicity relating to these and other health-related matters might affect consumers’
perceptions of Center Parcs’ holiday villages and reduce guest visits to its holiday villages.

**_Center Parcs depends on third party suppliers and contractors._**

Center Parcs has key contractual relationships with a number of third parties, including suppliers, insurers,
partners, banks and payment processors. In particular, Center Parcs relies on key suppliers to carry on its operations.
These include the Big Table Group Limited (formerly known as the Casual Dining Group) (“The Big Table Group”),
whose offering includes Café Rouge, Las Iguanas and Bella Italia, World Duty Free Group Limited (part of Avolta)
(“World Duty Free Group”), Center Parcs’ retail partner, and Joules, which runs retail shops in all five UK villages.
The Center Parcs business model incorporates a range of service relationships, with some food and beverage and retail
offerings operated on a concession basis, others, such as Starbucks, being licensed to Center Parcs and some “backof-house” services provided by third parties, including laundry services and food and beverage supplies. Center Parcs
also relies on third party service providers and IT systems such as payment processing services, ATCORE (formerly
Anite), a non-affiliated third-party company, which provides TourRes, the booking system used by Center Parcs, ESP,
which provides the booking system Elite for on-parc activities and restaurants and Adobe which provides the platform
for certain of Center Parcs’ websites.

42


-----

The failure of one or more of the third-party suppliers and contractors to deliver or provide the services when
needed by Center Parcs or at the desired quality may have an adverse impact on Center Parcs’ operations and business.
For example, some of our third-party suppliers have reported increased lead times as a result of Russia’s war in
Ukraine, the attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the resulting disruptions to global supply chains and shipping
channels, which may impact their ability to deliver or provide their services when needed by Center Parcs. Center
Parcs closely monitors its suppliers’ ongoing operations but cannot assure that its suppliers will be able to fulfil their
obligations in the future. The failure of one or more of these third parties to fulfil its obligations to Center Parcs for
any other reason, or the termination of such agreements by any of the third-party suppliers or contractors, may also
cause significant disruption and have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial performance and
prospects. From time to time, Center Parcs may terminate (by agreement or otherwise) the concessionaire agreements
in relation to all or some of the units operated by its concessionaire partners. For example, upon agreement with
Avolta, Center Parcs closed a number of its shops at Center Parcs’ villages,such as Time of Shade, Spirit and
Sportique, in 2020. Where such agreements are terminated, Center Parcs will seek to re-utilise this space for the
provision of alternative goods and services to be provided either by Center Parcs or other third parties. There can be
no certainty that any alternative use can be found or that any alternative will generate commercial returns as favourable
as those previously enjoyed.

Furthermore, third party suppliers may seek to increase prices for their services, including as a result of
ongoing high inflation. If Center Parcs is unable to negotiate limits to any price increases or find alternative thirdparty suppliers providing services at lower prices, such increases may negatively impact Center Parcs’ business. In
addition, material disputes may arise between Center Parcs and third-party service providers and suppliers, which
could adversely affect the relationship between Center Parcs and such third parties. Any or all such developments
could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Center Parcs’ insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that it could suffer, and its_**
**_insurance costs may increase._**

Companies engaged in the holiday centre business may be sued for substantial damages in the event of an
actual or alleged accident. A catastrophic loss or accident occurring at Center Parcs’ holiday villages or at competing
holiday villages may increase insurance premiums, and negatively impact Center Parcs’ operating results. Although
Center Parcs carries annual liability insurance to cover this risk, its coverage may not be adequate to cover liabilities,
and it may not be able to obtain adequate coverage should a catastrophic incident occur.

In particular, the lost revenue and increased operating costs resulting from closure of Center Parcs’ villages
due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing health and safety regulations were not covered by Center Parcs’ insurance
policies. Any future losses resulting from additional closures or reductions in Center Parcs’ operations pursuant to
government regulations or further outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics or epidemics are not
expected to be covered by Center Parcs’ insurance policies. Further, as a result of the macroeconomic environment, it
is possible that Center Parcs’ insurance premiums may increase and that the scope of coverage of Center Parcs’
insurance policies may decrease.

Center Parcs utilises a combination of self-insurance (through the use of large excesses payable by Center
Parcs) and insurance coverage programmes for property, business interruption, employer’s liability, public/products
liability and health care insurance. Pursuant to such programmes, Center Parcs is responsible for a specified amount
of claims and insures for claims above such limits. Potential liabilities that Center Parcs self-insures or buys
commercial insurance for could increase in the future. In addition, insurance may not be available to Center Parcs on
commercially acceptable terms or at all, or Center Parcs could experience increases in the cost of such insurance. Any
increase in the number of claims or amount per claim or increase in the cost of insurance could materially and adversely
affect Center Parcs’ results of operations.

The Obligors are required by the terms of the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements to insure the villages against
the risk of material damage or destruction and resulting business interruption, acts of terrorism, public and product
liabilities and such other risks as a prudent owner and operator of similar properties would insure against.

The Obligors have granted security to the Borrower Security Trustee under the terms of the Borrower Deed
of Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge for amounts which are or may become payable under all of its insurance
policies relating to material damage or destruction and resulting business interruption taken out by the relevant Obligor
in respect of the relevant village.

43


-----

A failure by any of the Obligors to renew the relevant insurance policies in respect of a village may, upon
damage to the village or loss of revenue in respect to the village (which would otherwise have been recoverable under
such insurance policy), result in a corresponding loss in the value of such village or payment recovery under the loan
made to the relevant Borrower. Similarly, even where the relevant insurance policy is current, there could be an
administrative delay in the receipt of payment by the Obligors from the insurers which could affect the ability of the
Obligors to meet their respective payment obligations during that period of delay.

Certain types of risks and losses (such as losses resulting from epidemics and pandemics, including COVID19, war, terrorism, nuclear radiation, radioactive contamination and heaving or settling of structures) may be or
become either uninsurable or uneconomical to insure or may not be covered by the relevant insurance policies. Other
risks might become uninsurable (or uneconomical to insure) in the future. The occurrence of significant uninsured or
uninsurable losses could materially and adversely affect Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of
operations, which could result in the Obligors not having sufficient funds to repay in full amounts owing under or in
**respect of the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements.**

**_Center Parcs’ future performance depends on continued maintenance capital expenditure and investment capital_**
**_expenditure, which may be significant. Any failure to make the requisite maintenance capital expenditure or_**
**_investment capital expenditure in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,_**
**_financial condition and results of operations._**

Center Parcs’ future performance depends on making continued maintenance capital expenditure and
investment capital expenditure, which may be significant. A principal competitive factor for a holiday village is the
uniqueness and perceived quality of its accommodation, amenities and facilities. Accordingly, the regular addition of
new or improved accommodation, amenities and facilities and the repair or maintenance of those in existence are key
to the continued competitiveness of Center Parcs’ holiday villages.

Maintenance capital expenditures include refurbishments to existing facilities, including ensuring health and
safety standards are met. Although the Obligors are required under the terms of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement to spend a minimum of £18.5 million per year on maintenance capital expenditure, there can be no
assurance that this amount will be sufficient for Center Parcs’ requirements. Center Parcs’ maintenance capital
expenditure for financial years 2022 and 2023 was approximately £26.4 million and £43.0 million, respectively.
Center Parcs’ maintenance capital expenditure for the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023 was approximately
£27.7 million.

Investment capital expenditures include building new accommodation, upgrading existing accommodation
and adding, upgrading or expanding cafes, restaurants and other facilities. Center Parcs’ investment capital
expenditure for financial years 2022 and 2023 was approximately £21.6 million and £27.1 million, respectively,
following materially lower total investment capital expenditure during the 2021 financial year of £12.1 million as
Center Parcs curtailed non-essential investment due to COVID-19. Center Parcs’ investment capital expenditure for
the 36-week periods ended 29 December 2022 and 30 December 2023 was approximately £15.5 million and
£21.8 million, respectively. While Center Parcs expects to continue its investment capital expenditures over the next
several years, the development and construction of such projects not currently under construction is subject to
additional risks, including construction delays as a result of business activity restrictions and supply chain
interruptions. As a result, Center Parcs’ current development plans may not be completed as planned, which may
impact future growth.

Historical and future investment capital expenditure may not yield the anticipated revenue or ADR growth
or improve the attractiveness of Center Parcs’ holiday villages. Even if revenues do increase, the additional revenues
may not be sufficient to recover the amounts invested by Center Parcs and to provide a return on such investments. In
addition, if Center Parcs does not have sufficient liquidity to finance these upgrades or if insufficient amounts are
spent on capital expenditure on the villages, Center Parcs’ villages may not remain competitive.

There could be a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of
operations if it fails to maintain the planned approach to its maintenance and investment cycle and/or if any investment
that does not result in revenue growth does not otherwise recover the amount invested or does not maintain the longterm attractiveness or good and safe condition of the relevant holiday village. Moreover, delays in the addition of new
or improved accommodation, amenities and facilities or the closure of any of its amenities and facilities for repairs
could adversely affect occupancy levels and Center Parcs’ ability to realise revenue growth, which could have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

44


-----

**_Failure to keep pace with developments in technology or any problems with maintaining or implementing upgrades_**
**_to Center Parcs’ IT systems could impair Center Parcs’ operations or competitive position._**

The holiday centre industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems, including
those systems and technologies used for Center Parcs’ bookings, revenue management and property management
platforms. These technologies and systems must be refined, updated and/or replaced with more advanced systems on
a regular basis. If Center Parcs is unable to do so as quickly as its competitors, within budget cost and time frames or
at all, its business could suffer. Center Parcs is in the process of making updates to existing systems and introducing
new IT systems and technologies aimed at improving pricing for bookings, targeting new and repeat customers,
strengthening and integrating customer relationship management processes. Any problems with transitioning to or
integrating its new systems could adversely affect Center Parcs’ business. In particular, the implementation of the new
IT systems could take longer than expected, disrupt Center Parcs’ current systems and/or result in cost overruns.
Center Parcs also may not achieve the benefits that it anticipates from these systems or any other new technology or
system in the future. Center Parcs is considering the further use of technological advances including machine learning,
large language models and other forms of artificial intelligence across its business but there can be no assurance it will
be able to successfully adopt these in a timely or cost-efficient manner, or at all. In addition, the new technological
advances may be subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. If any of these risks were to be realised, this could have a
material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial conditions and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs’ business could be harmed if it loses the services of its key management personnel or is unable to_**
**_attract and retain qualified employees._**

Center Parcs’ business depends upon the efforts and dedication of its senior management team and its staff,
both in the villages and at its head office. Competition for highly-qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of the
services of any of these key personnel without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel
could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, its success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees to keep pace with its
needs. If Center Parcs is unable to do so, its results of operations may be adversely affected.

In addition, Center Parcs’ future business success depends in part on its ability to continue to recruit, train,
motivate and retain employees and on its ability to continue to employ creative employees and consultants. The loss
of service of any key personnel, or an inability to attract and retain qualified employees and consultants, could have a
material adverse impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

Higher turnover rates of employees, as seen during the economic downturn subsquent to the COVID-19
pandemic, require Center Parcs to engage in greater levels of recruitment activity which may increase recruitment and
training costs. An increase in turnover rates and the resultant increase in recruitment activity may also lead to a greater
proportion of employees undergoing training and, therefore, not being productive. Staff shortfalls at Center Parcs’
villages due to increased employee turnover rates and increased absences caused by illness or otherwise, may have a
material adverse impact on Center Parcs’ ability to operate the villages and adequately provide services to its guests
if Center Parcs is unable to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees.

**_The operation and development of Center Parcs’ holiday villages are subject to planning and other consents, laws_**
**_and regulations, which may constrain future development or new facilities and amenities. In addition, changes in_**
**_use or planning consents relating to property neighbouring the villages may have a material detrimental effect on_**
**_guests’ enjoyment of the villages._**

Center Parcs’ villages are required to be constructed in accordance with the relevant planning permission to
ensure that the current use of the holiday villages is lawful. If the construction or use of a holiday village is not in
accordance with the relevant planning permission, the relevant council may, in certain circumstances, require that use
to cease. Further, a council can require compliance with the conditions of any planning permission or planning
agreement, or, in certain circumstances, the alteration or reinstatement of any construction carried out without planning
permission.

All of Center Parcs’ villages are in rural locations. Center Parcs may experience material difficulties or
failures in maintaining or renewing the necessary licences or approvals for its holiday villages, which could result in
holiday village or attraction closures or fines. Stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to
zoning, land use and environmental factors could also delay or prevent development of new holiday villages in
particular locations. In the future, obtaining planning permission for future developments or new facilities and
amenities may be difficult. In addition, if any such planning permissions cannot be obtained, there are limited

45


-----

alternative uses for rural sites of the size of the villages where base land values are low and alternative planning
permissions are unlikely.

The operation, development and redevelopment of recreational facilities and other structures at Center Parcs’
holiday villages and the development of new or additional villages may require consent from the relevant local
planning authorities as well as from third parties, such as landlords, development partners, finance providers and
regulatory bodies. Center Parcs may not be able to obtain the requisite planning or other consents as and when required
in respect of developments or redevelopments or the roll-out of new or additional holiday villages, and planning or
other consents may be withdrawn in relation to existing offerings at any of its holiday villages. In addition, Center
Parcs’ properties may be subject to certain restrictive covenants in favour of third parties.

From time to time, Center Parcs plans to build additional new units of accommodation, subject to planning
permission and other factors. If Center Parcs is unable to obtain the requisite planning permissions for these additional
lodges at the existing villages, it would be unable to construct these additional lodges, which would have an adverse
effect on Center Parcs’ expansion plans for these sites.

Center Parcs works with and engages its local planning authorities with regard to issues of shared concern
that impact the development and redevelopment of its properties and the roll-out of new holiday villages, including
sensitivities to site noise, listed structures, road congestion and other traffic issues, and health and safety issues. If it
were to fail to cooperate with local planning authorities or if Center Parcs’ work relationship with such authorities
were to be adversely affected for any reason, this could negatively impact its ability to obtain the planning and other
consents necessary for the development and redevelopment of current villages or expanding into new villages, or it
could result in the withdrawal of existing consents. Additionally, possible changes to planning rules (such as the
categorisation of flood zones), or by-law distances which prohibit development within a certain distance of flood
defence structures) would, if made, adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to develop a holiday village. Additional
constraints on future development could have an adverse effect on guest numbers, which could have a material adverse
effect on its business.

Any refusal to grant, or delay in granting Center Parcs’ requested planning or other consents, or the
application of any special conditions to such consents (or breach by Center Parcs of such conditions), could have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, future planning
consents are likely to impose further conditions and/or require Center Parcs to enter into new planning agreements. In
addition, proposed regeneration schemes may adversely impact guest access to, or the operation of, individual
facilities. The constraints placed on Center Parcs’ operations by future planning consents or regeneration schemes
may be more onerous than those that currently apply, and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Changes in use or planning consents relating to property neighbouring the villages may have a material
detrimental effect on guests’ enjoyment of the villages. For example, changes in use or planning consents could permit
owners or occupiers of property adjoining or close to Center Parcs’ villages to use their property in a way that disturbs
or diminishes guests’ enjoyment of the villages or the natural setting in which the villages are located. These uses
would include the installation or use of plant and equipment (e.g. electricity pylons) or activities that emit noise or
smell, or that are inconsistent with guests’ enjoyment of a holiday in a natural environment. Any such detrimental
change, or negative publicity regarding such a change, may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs may be subject to liabilities and costs associated with its intellectual property._**

Center Parcs relies on trademarks to protect its brand. Many of these trademarks have been a key part of
establishing its business in the UK holiday market, including Center Parcs and Aqua Sana. Center Parcs believes these
trademarks have significant value and are important to the marketing of its villages. The steps Center Parcs has taken
or will take to protect its proprietary trademark rights may not provide adequate protection, and Center Parcs may not
have adequate resources to enforce its trademarks if third parties infringe its trademarks. In addition, although Center
Parcs owns its trademarks, these trademarks may infringe the proprietary rights of others and may not be upheld if
challenged. If its trademarks infringe the rights of others, Center Parcs may be prevented from using its trademarks,
any of which occurrences could harm its business. In any such event, Center Parcs could be forced to rebrand its
products and services, which could result in loss of brand recognition and may require Center Parcs to devote
significant resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, any claims of trademark infringement may

46


-----

require Center Parcs to enter into a royalty or licensing agreement to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual
property, which may not be available on terms acceptable to Center Parcs.

From time to time, Center Parcs enters into agreements with third parties that permit it to use the intellectual
property of such third parties at its holiday villages. The third parties owning such intellectual property may not renew
such agreements with Center Parcs or may increase the cost for it to use such intellectual property to levels that make
it cost prohibitive or economically unfavourable for it to continue such arrangements.

**_Potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect Center Parcs’ business._**

From time to time, Center Parcs may become involved in litigation and regulatory actions as part of its
ordinary course of business. There is no guarantee that it will be successful in defending against civil suits or regulatory
actions, such as matters related to public and employee safety, food safety, employment and environmental laws and
regulations.

Even if a civil litigation claim or regulatory investigation or claim is meritless, does not prevail or is not
pursued, any negative publicity surrounding assertions against Center Parcs’ holiday villages could adversely affect
its reputation. Regardless of their outcome, litigation and regulatory actions may result in substantial costs and
expenses and divert the attention of Center Parcs’ management. In addition to pending matters, future litigation,
government proceedings, labour disputes or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of
Center Parcs’ normal business operations, which may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,
financial condition and results of operations. See “Business – Legal Proceedings”.

**_Center Parcs relies on information technology in its operations and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption_**
**_or breach of security of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate its business and subject it to_**
**_data loss, litigation, liability and reputational harm._**

Center Parcs relies on its information systems across its operations, such as in the processing of payment
details, and on those of its third parties service providers, including the online booking systems provided by ATCORE
and Elite. Its ability to effectively manage its business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these
systems. The website providing information and booking services for Center Parcs’ spas and Center Parcs’ website
utilise the Adobe platform. Extended or widespread outages of the online accommodation or activities booking system
(including the self-service booking points on-site) could adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to take guest bookings
(as online bookings can be made exclusively through its website).

The provision of convenient, trusted, fast and effective payment processing services to Center Parcs’ guests
is critical to its business. If there is any deterioration in the quality of the payment processing services provided to
Center Parcs’ guests or any interruption to those services, or if such services are only available at an increased cost to
Center Parcs or its guests or are terminated and no timely and comparable replacement services are found, Center
Parcs’ guests may be deterred from booking Center Parcs breaks.

Center Parcs, and third-party service providers on its behalf, collect, process and retain large volumes of
guest data, which, together with employee data and other confidential information, is entered into, processed,
summarised and reported by various information systems. Center Parcs also uses video surveillance in certain public
areas for security purposes. The footage from such surveillance is also subject to data protection and privacy laws.

Notwithstanding the efforts and technology of Center Parcs and its third-party service providers to secure
their computer networks, the security of those networks could be compromised. Third parties may have the technology
or know-how to breach the security of Center Parcs’ guest, employee and other confidential information, and Center
Parcs’ security measures (or those of its third-party service providers) may not effectively prohibit others from
obtaining improper access to this information, destroying or stealing valuable information or disrupting Center Parcs’
operations. In addition, Center Parcs or any of its third-party service providers may lose data, including guest data and
payment details, or may fail to transmit such data online in a secure manner. In each case, if any theft or loss of
personal guest data were to occur, Center Parcs could face liability (including fines) under data protection or privacy
laws and lose the goodwill of its guests, incurring significant reputational harm. Such security breaches could have a
material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

If the guest, employee or other data held by Center Parcs is not accurate or complete, there is a risk that
Center Parcs could make incorrect decisions regarding marketing, pricing, cost management or other factors that
impact its financial performance.

47


-----

Any computer virus, security breach, loss, or theft of company, guest or employee data could expose Center
Parcs to adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, regulatory action, or cause Center Parcs to incur significant costs
to reimburse third parties for damages, which could impact its results of operations. In financial year 2022, Center
Parcs installed a new security incident and event management system (SIEM) to identify and prevent cyberattacks.
Failure to properly manage the system may expose Center Parcs to security breaches which could impact its results of
operation.

**_Center Parcs is subject to privacy and data protection laws and any data breach or change in legislation could_**
**_adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to market its products effectively._**

In the ordinary course of business, Center Parcs collects, transmits and stores guest and employee data,
including highly sensitive personally identifiable information, in information systems that it maintains. Center Parcs
has a large guest database made up of prospective, current and former guests. This data could be a target for cyberattack. While the protection of such guest and employee data is critical to Center Parcs and Center Parcs takes steps
to protect such data, any such attack could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Furthermore, Center Parcs’ use of this information is subject to numerous laws, regulations and standards
designed to protect sensitive or confidential client and employee data. The General Data Protection Regulation
(“GDPR”) began to apply from 25 May 2018 and introduced significant changes to data protection law. In particular,
the GDPR contains much higher penalties for breaches, new obligations for data processors, increased accountability,
expanded rights for data subjects and an extended territorial scope. Center Parcs seeks to ensure that procedures are
in place to ensure compliance with the relevant data protection regulations by its employees and any third-party service
providers. However, further changes may be required in respect of the way Center Parcs collects, stores and otherwise
processes personal data as the market adjusts to the developing interpretation and application of relevant data
protection legislation. Any future changes to data protection regulations may be significant or costly and may have a
material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Despite its efforts to ensure that its employees and any third party service providers apply with any relevant
data protection regulations, including the GDPR, Center Parcs is exposed to the risk that employee or guest data could
be wrongfully appropriated, lost, disclosed, stolen or processed in breach of data protection regulations. For example,
Center Parcs recently experienced a breach of employee personal data. The breach was detected promptly and notified
to the regulator, which did not undertake enforcement action, and related legal claims by employees were covered by
insurance. If Center Parcs, or any of the third-party service providers on which it relies, fail to store or transmit guest
or employee information and online payment details in a secure manner, or if any loss of personal customer data were
otherwise to occur, Center Parcs could face liability under data protection laws and be subject to legal claims by
affected individuals.

Center Parcs’ holiday villages rely on its guest database and a variety of direct marketing techniques,
including email marketing. Any expansion of existing, and/or implementation of new, laws and regulations regarding
marketing, solicitation, privacy or data protection could adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to utilise its guest
database for email and other marketing techniques and could result in changes to its marketing strategy. If this occurs,
Center Parcs may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could materially adversely
impact its guest numbers and revenues.

**_Center Parcs may be adversely affected by environmental requirements and liabilities._**

Center Parcs is subject to extensive and frequently changing national and local environmental laws and
regulations, including laws and regulations governing air and noise emissions; water use and wastewater and
stormwater discharges; the maintenance of above-ground and underground storage tanks; the use, release, storage,
disposal, handling and transportation of, and exposure to, oil, chemicals and hazardous substances; energy usage and
emissions; the management and disposal of waste; and otherwise relating to health and safety and the protection of
the environment, natural resources and the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater. The development and
operation of Center Parcs’ facilities require various permits and licences pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations, which can result in challenges in the applications process, constraints in on-site operations, and costs in
compliance.

Violations of environmental laws and regulations can lead to significant fines and penalties and requirements
for rectification, which could require expenditure, changes in site operations or temporary closures of all or part of the
relevant holiday centre. Such laws and regulations can impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to

whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of contaminants. Historical land uses on parts of the village sites,
such as quarrying, timber treatment, an electrical substation, sewage discharge/treatment, and a small part of the
Whinfell Forest site that is a registered landfill (which is now closed, but is relatively close to an off-site potable water
abstraction point), may have introduced pollution or contamination into the soil and/or groundwater in parts of the
Center Parcs village sites or may have migrated beyond the boundaries of these sites. Sanctions for alleged or actual
non-compliance with environmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,
financial condition and results of operations. Center Parcs is also subject to certain contractual requirements relating
to the environment and may incur liabilities arising from historical, existing and future environmental contamination
at properties it owns or operates now or in the future or has owned or operated in the past. The presence of hazardous
substances on a property or the failure to meet environmental regulatory requirements may cause Center Parcs to incur
substantial remediation or compliance costs or temporarily close the relevant holiday centre. In addition, if hazardous
substances are located on or released from any of its properties, Center Parcs could incur substantial liabilities through
a private party personal injury claim, a claim by an adjacent property owner for property damage or a claim by a
governmental entity for other damages, such as natural resource damages. Center Parcs is also required to purchase
carbon allowances annually commensurate with energy consumption (with allowance prices increasing each year),
and to audit energy use, both of which are subject to financial penalties for non-compliance.

Center Parcs may incur additional expenditure and other commercial and financial impacts to comply with
existing as well as new or revised environmental legislation and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and
regulations or more rigorous enforcement of such laws and regulations, as well as in connection with fulfilling
contractual obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition
and results of operations. A conviction for an environmental offence could also negatively affect Center Parcs’ ability
to contract with certain third parties in the future.

If an environmental liability arises in relation to any of the holiday villages and it is not remedied, or is not
capable of being remedied, this may adversely affect Center Parcs’ business or financial condition. This may be either
because of cost or value implications for Center Parcs and its properties or because of disruption to services provided
at the relevant holiday village.

**_Center Parcs’ existing leases are subject to early termination risks and Center Parcs may be unable to renew_**
**_headleases or obtain new leases on acceptable terms._**

The headleases for Elveden Forest and Sherwood Forest expire in 2999, the headleases for Longleat Forest
expire in 2073, the headleases for Whinfell Forest expire in 2120 and the headlease for Woburn Forest expires in
2109. There is a risk that the landlord of the relevant property may terminate the headlease (and in the case of Longleat
Forest, the superior landlord may forfeit the superior leases causing the two headleases to terminate) before the expiry
of the contractual term for failure to pay rent or other breach of tenant obligation.

The rent payable under each of the headleases for Whinfell Forest, Elveden Forest and Sherwood Forest is a
nominal sum. The yearly rent payable under the headleases for Longleat Forest is currently £936,637 in aggregate
subject to upwards-only review every five years by reference to the historic increase in revenue at Longleat Forest.
The most recent rent review for Longleat Forest was settled in January 2020 and the next review is scheduled for
2025. The rent payable under the Woburn Forest lease is currently £840,635 per annum payable since 31 March 2023
and subject to upwards only review every five years by reference to the greater of an increase in rent in line with the
retail price index, a fixed percentage increase in the passing rent or the historic increase in revenue at Woburn Forest.
The next rent review at Woburn Forest is scheduled for March 2028. Other tenant obligations in the headleases
include, but are not limited to, an obligation to keep the properties in good and substantial repair. A failure to pay rent,
including as a result of any rent increases, or other breach of tenant obligation may result in an early termination of
the relevant lease. Any early termination, delay in or inability to renew Center Parcs’ existing leases may negatively
impact its ability to operate its villages. Each Obligor has undertaken in the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements to pay,
when due, all sums payable by it under each headlease, to perform and observe all of its material covenants under
each headlease and not to commit a material breach of any headlease.

The headleases for Whinfell Forest and Longleat Forest do not contain mortgagee protection provisions in
the event of forfeiture. The Woburn Forest headlease does contain mortgagee protection provisions and therefore,
before the landlord can forfeit the headlease, it is obliged to notify the mortgagee of its intention to do so, giving the
mortgagee, within a period of three months, the opportunity to i) enter into a deed of covenant with the landlord to
comply with the tenant obligations in the lease or ii) procure an assignment of the lease to a third party in accordance
with the terms of the headlease. If a landlord were to seek to forfeit a headlease, the Obligor owning the property and

49


-----

the Borrower Security Trustee would have a right to apply to the English courts to seek relief from forfeiture. The
headleases for Elveden Forest and Sherwood Forest contain a proviso in the forfeiture clause that in the event of the
landlord serving notice on the tenant alleging breach of any material covenant by the tenant, the landlord must
contemporaneously serve a copy of the notice on any mortgagee of which the landlord has notice and the landlord
must give not less than ten days’ prior notice to any mortgagee to exercise any right of re-entry.

**_Any property on which the villages are located may be subject to compulsory purchase._**

Any property in the UK may at any time be compulsorily acquired by a public authority possessing
compulsory purchase powers (for instance, local authorities and statutory undertakings (including electricity, gas,
water and railway undertakers) in respect of their statutory functions) if it can demonstrate that the acquisition is
required. Where any land is acquired through compulsory purchase, such as the initiation of the compulsory purchase
order for the acquisition of a portion of Center Parcs’ property at Whinfell Forest in March 2022, compensation would
be payable to Center Parcs as a result. However, any such compensation may not reflect the value to Center Parcs of
the affected land.

Any promoter of a compulsory purchaser order would need to demonstrate that compulsory purchase was
necessary or desirable for the promoter’s statutory functions and for, or in, the public interest. As a general rule, in the
event of an order being made in respect of all or any part of any holiday village, compensation would normally be
payable on the basis that it be broadly equivalent to the open market value of all owners’ and tenants’ proprietary
interests in the portion of the village subject to compulsory purchase at the time of the related purchase, so far as those
interests are included in the order. Compensation would normally be payable in respect of the land acquired and the
diminution in value of any retained land, reduction in rent and other adverse impacts of the compulsory purchase
scheme.

There is often a delay between the compulsory purchase of a property and the payment of compensation,
although advance payment of compensation is available representing 90% of the amount of compensation which the
acquiring authority considers is due (where the acquiring authority takes possession before compensation has been
agreed).

Compulsory purchase of all or any significant portion of property relating to the villages, or the payment of
compensation that does not reflect the value to Center Parcs of affected land, may have a material adverse effect on
Center Parcs’ financial condition and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs is exposed to risks in connection with the funding of its pension commitments under the Center Parcs_**
**_Senior Pension Scheme._**

Center Parcs currently operates the Center Parcs Senior Pension Scheme, an occupational final salary
(defined benefit) pension scheme (“FS Scheme”). Center Parcs’ current pension funding commitments in respect of
the FS Scheme are not considered material in the context of its revenue and assets. However, defined benefit pension
scheme liabilities vary over time and the regulatory regime for pension schemes in the UK is undergoing change.

Valuations of all UK defined benefit plans are required to be conducted on at least a triennial basis in
accordance with legislative requirements, and the trustees and employers of the applicable plan will be required to
agree a recovery plan which seeks to pay off any funding deficit disclosed in the context of such valuations over an
agreed period of time. Accordingly, Center Parcs is exposed to the risk that its pension funding commitments may
increase over time in the context of subsequent valuations of the FS Scheme. The valuation in July 2020 revealed a
deficit of £4.4 million on an on-going basis, following which a recovery plan was agreed which was intended to
eliminate this deficit by 1 August 2025. As at 31 July 2023, the deficit in relation to the FS Scheme was £0.6 million.

Under the Pensions Act 2004 (the “Pensions Act”), if certain statutory requirements are met, the Pensions
Regulator has “moral hazard” powers to impose liabilities relating to defined benefit pension schemes on the
employing companies of the schemes and on persons who are, or have been, connected or associated with such
employers (which in relation to the FS Scheme may extend beyond Centre Parcs group companies to include group
directors, significant shareholders and non-UK group companies). The Pensions Regulator can require such persons:
(i) to make contributions to the schemes (by imposing a contribution notice (“CN”)) where there has been an act or
omission, one of the main purposes of which is to avoid any “employer debt” becoming due or to compromise or
otherwise reduce the amount of that debt or which otherwise has a materially detrimental impact on the likelihood of
accrued scheme benefits being received), or (ii) to put in place arrangements for the financial support of the schemes
(by imposing a financial support direction (“FSD”), in certain circumstances and where (for either (i) or (ii) above)

50


-----

the Pensions Regulator considers it reasonable to do so. The target must have been an employing company of the
scheme or connected or associated with the employer within the previous six years in the case of CNs, and two years
in the case of FSDs. Where a CN or FSD is issued against a target after a liquidation or administration in the UK has
commenced in respect of that target, the relevant debt claim will be treated as a provable debt in the insolvency
proceedings. On 1 October 2021, certain amendments to the Pensions Act came into force which are relevant to Center
Parcs, group directors and third parties:

  - The circumstances in which the Pensions Regulator can issue a CN have been significantly widened by
allowing the Pensions Regulator to issue a CN where an act or failure to act: (i) materially reduced the debt
likely to be recovered from the employer in the event of an immediate insolvency (the “employer insolvency”
test) or (ii) reduced the resources of the employer in a manner that was material when compared to the buyout
deficit of the pension scheme (the “employer resources” test). In both of the two new tests, the Pensions
Regulator must consider it reasonable to issue a CN.

  - There are two new criminal offences of “risking accrued scheme benefits” (where a person engages in an act
that they knew or ought to have known would have a materially detrimental impact on a defined benefit
pension scheme) and “avoidance of employer debt” (where a person acts in a way that prevents the recovery
of any employer debt which is due to a defined benefit pension scheme or otherwise compromises or settles
such a debt and the person intended the act to have such an effect). Each offence carries a maximum penalty
of unlimited fines and seven years in prison. Both of these offences are very broad in their scope. In addition,
the way that the offences have been framed in the Pensions Act means that these offences target a wider
range of parties than just those connected to the pension scheme’s sponsoring employer, such as directors, as
they are drafted to apply to any person. Acts of third parties, including banks, investors, and commercial
counterparties, as well as acts of pension scheme trustees and professional advisers, could all fall within the
scope of these new criminal offences. Unless a person has “reasonable excuse”, criminal liability could be
imposed. The Act includes no further details on how the “reasonable excuse” proviso would operate although
the Pensions Regulator has published its policy on setting out its approach to the investigation and
prosecution of these new criminal offences.

  - The Pensions Act also introduces two new civil penalties known as the “financial penalty for avoiding
employer debt” (where there has been a deliberate act or omission, one of the main purposes of which was
to avoid any “employer debt” becoming due or to compromise or otherwise reduce the amount of that debt)
and the “financial penalty for conduct risking accrued scheme benefits” (where there has been a deliberate
act or failure to act which detrimentally affected in a material way the likelihood of accrued scheme benefits
being received and the person knew or ought to have known it would have that effect). Any person may be
issued with a fine under the new civil penalties as they do not apply only to employers in respect of
occupational pension schemes and persons who are connected with or an associate of an employer. In both
of the two new tests, it must not have been reasonable for the person to act or fail to act as they did. The
maximum fine that the Pensions Regulator may impose is £1 million.

As a result, Center Parcs may incur additional expenditure and face other commercial and financial impacts
to comply with existing as well as new or revised pensions legislation and regulations, new interpretations of existing
laws and regulations or more rigorous enforcement of such laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse
impact on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Noteholders will not have recourse to any additional village outside the UK, its assets, revenues or cash flow._**
**_Development of any such village may divert management’s time from villages in the UK._**

In July 2019, an indirect parent of Center Parcs (Holding 1) Limited opened a sixth village, Longford Forest,
in County Longford, Republic of Ireland. Longford Forest is outside of the Obligor Group. Subject to the terms of the
Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, Center Parcs’ management is permitted to devote up to 25% of its time
toward any additional villages located outside the UK, including to provide a number of services to help develop and
operate Longford Forest. These services include the provision of development services such as running tender
processes for contractors and using reasonable endeavours to obtain required licenses and consents as well as operating
services such as recruitment services, employee training, incorporating Longford Forest into the sales and marketing
activity undertaken by the Center Parcs Group, the provision of customer services such as handling general guest
queries via call centre and e-mail, the provision of a reservations system and the taking of bookings, pricing and budget
setting, health & safety advice, compliance and legal support, financial reporting and IT support together with a range

51


-----

of other corporate support services. Although the Longford Management Services Agreement provides that Center
Parcs will be compensated for management’s time spent on Longford Forest, these arrangements may not sufficiently
compensate Center Parcs for the cost of providing such services and may divert management’s time from the
management of villages in the UK, subject to the 25% limit described above.

Under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, none of the Obligors will own assets relating to, or
derive revenues from, Longford Forest or any other additional villages outside the UK. Noteholders will not have
recourse to any such village outside the UK, its assets, revenues or cash flow. In addition, the development of
additional villages outside the UK could divert management’s time from the five existing villages or from any
additional villages in the UK and may impose additional burdens on Center Parcs’ limited management resources.
This could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ financial condition, results of operations and business.

**_Center Parcs may not be able to successfully develop new villages and it may not realise desired returns from new_**
**_villages or other villages it may acquire._**

From time to time, Center Parcs evaluates suitable locations for new villages to develop or acquire. In July
2021, Center Parcs secured an option agreement for a potential sixth site in the UK at Oldhouse Warren, West Sussex.
However, following environmental and ecological surveys, the site was not found to be suitable. Center Parcs plans
to continue searching for a suitable location for a sixth site in the UK. Finding an appropriate site for an additional
village in the UK may be difficult and any expenses or costs incurred in assessing the suitability of a site may not be
recouped if the site is ultimately found to be unsuitable.

Holders of the Class A Notes will have recourse to any additional villages that Center Parcs constructs or
acquires in the UK, including the potential sixth site, only if and when certain conditions under the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement are satisfied following completion of the development of such additional villages,
at which point any such additional villages will be transferred into the Obligor Group. See “—Risks Relating to the
_Offered Notes—Holders of the Class B7 Notes will have recourse to any additional villages that Center Parcs_
_constructs or acquires in the UK only if and when certain conditions under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan_
_Agreement are satisfied following completion of the development of such additional villages. These conditions may_
_not be satisfied when expected, or at all.” Any new village development would be subject to planning permission and_
other relevant consents and there can be no assurance that such consents will be received. See “The operation and
_development of Center Parcs’ holiday villages are subject to planning and other consents, laws and regulations, which_
_may constrain future development or new facilities and amenities. In addition, changes in use or planning consents_
_relating to property neighbouring the villages may have a material detrimental effect on guests’ enjoyment of the_
_villages.” Center Parcs may not be able to successfully identify and secure such locations or may not be able to_
successfully execute opening such villages.

New villages may fail to become operational on a timely basis or at all due to setbacks including but not
limited to delays or failure to receive planning permissions or other consents, inability to meet development requests
from local authorities, infrastructure issues, construction delays, inadequate or delayed financing, the delay or inability
to recruit or manage appropriately skilled employees or the inability to identify or secure agreements with key
suppliers or development partners. Furthermore, once opened, new villages may not attract anticipated volumes of
guests, either in the short or long term, as a result of social distancing guidelines, reduced customer demand, differing
customer expectations and preferences in these new locations or due to other factors.

The integration of a new village is a complex and time-consuming process. Center Parcs may not be able to
integrate effectively any village it develops or acquires or successfully implement appropriate operational, financial
and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from such developments or
acquisitions. Center Parcs may also be subject to unexpected claims and liabilities arising from such developments or
acquisitions. These claims and liabilities could be costly to defend, could be material to its financial position and might
exceed either the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of the
indemnifying parties. The diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in
connection with the integration of the businesses Center Parcs develops or acquires could negatively impact its
business and results of operations. Further, the benefits that it anticipates from these new developments or acquisitions
may not be realised.

Any expansion into a new country would result in Center Parcs being subject to the laws and regulations of
that country, including taxation. As a result, Center Parcs’ risk exposure to political and regulatory changes will
increase as a result of opening a village in another country. The impact of, and costs associated with, complying with

52


-----

changes in interpretation of existing, or the adoption of new, legislation, regulations or other laws or licensing and
authorisation regimes in the jurisdictions in which Center Parcs has plans to operate can be difficult to anticipate or
estimate and could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of
operations. Expansion into a new country could also subject Center Parcs to risks related to adverse fluctuations in
currency exchange rates. Further, the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement permits management to only devote
up to 25% of its time towards any additional villages located outside the UK, including Longford Forest in the
Republic of Ireland, which is outside the Obligor Group, and does not require any additional Center Parcs villages
that may be developed outside the UK (including Longford Forest) to accede to the Obligor Group.

Additionally, if Center Parcs wishes to use the Center Parcs brand for a village located outside of the UK,
the Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland, it must invite CP Continental Europe to participate in all aspects of
the development, funding, ownership and future management of such village. If CP Continental Europe accepts the
invitation, Center Parcs and CP Continental Europe would have to participate in the development and management of
the village on terms identical to each other. As a result, Center Parcs may not be able to effectively integrate such
village into its existing business structure, which may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,
financial condition and results of operations.

The occurrence of any of these factors could negatively impact the ability of Center Parcs to generate the
desired returns from its strategy of international expansion, which could have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE FINANCING STRUCTURE**

**_The Obligors’ ability to meet their obligations in respect of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will_**
**_depend primarily on the performance of their businesses and Center Parcs may not be able to generate sufficient_**
**_cash flows to meet such obligations._**

The Obligors’ ability to meet their scheduled payment obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement will depend upon the financial condition and performance of the Center Parcs business as a whole and
their general financial condition and operating performance, which in turn will be affected by general economic
conditions and by financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond their control. See “—Risks Relating to
_Center Parcs’ Business and Industry—Economic and geopolitical events and conditions, including inflation, higher_
_interest rates and political instability, particularly in England, may affect Center Parcs’ revenues, operating costs_
_and profitability.” The obligations of the Obligors to make payments under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan_
Agreement are in each case full-recourse obligations and are not limited. Future performance of Center Parcs’ business
may not be similar to the performance results of operations of the business to date described in this Offering
Memorandum.

In connection with the Refinancing, the Class B4 Borrowers expect to prepay the Class B4 Loan in full
(together with accrued interest due in respect of the Class B4 Notes) on the Ninth Closing Date using part of the
proceeds, directly or indirectly, of the Class B7 Loan.

Unless previously repaid in full, the Borrowers will be required to repay (i) the Class A4 Loan, the Class A5
Loan, the Class A6 Loan and the Class A7 Loan on the Class A4 Loan Final Maturity Date (in respect of the Class
A4 Loan), the Class A5 Loan Maturity Date (in respect of the Class A5 Loan), the Class A6 Loan Maturity Date (in
respect of the Class A6 Loan) and the the Class A7 Loan Maturity Date (in respect of the Class A7 Loan) respectively
and (ii) the Class B Loans on the Class B5 Loan Final Maturity Date (in respect of the Class B5 Loan), the Class B6
Loan Final Maturity Date (in respect of the Class B6 Loan) and the Class B7 Loan Final Maturity Date (in respect of
the Class B7 Loan) (together with the Class A4 Loan Final Maturity Date, the Class A5 Loan Final Maturity Date, the
Class A6 Loan Final Maturity Date, the Class A7 Loan Final Maturity Date, the Class B5 Loan Maturity Date and the
Class B6 Loan Maturity Date, the “Loan Repayment Dates”).

The ability of the Issuer to redeem the Class B5 Notes on the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date, the
Class B6 Notes on the Class B6 Note Expected Maturity Date, and the Class B7 Notes on the Class B7 Note Expected
Maturity Date is dependent on the repayment in full of the corresponding Class B5 Loan, Class B6 Loan or Class B7
Loan, as applicable, by the Borrowers. Center Parcs cannot assure holders that its business will generate sufficient
cash flow from operations or that future sources of capital will be available to it in an amount sufficient to enable the
Obligors to service their indebtedness, including the Class B5 Loan, Class B6 Loan, and the Class B7 Loan, or to fund
their other liquidity needs.

53


-----

Further, a failure to repay the Class B5 Loan on the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date, the Class B6
Loan on the Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date and/or the Class B7 Loan on the Class B7 Loan Expected Maturity
Date will not constitute an event of default but, while the Class A Loans are outstanding, will only give rise to a Share
Enforcement Event.

**_Center Parcs has significant leverage which could adversely affect its financial condition and its ability to service_**
**_its payment obligations under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements and therefore the ability of the Issuer to_**
**_service its payment obligations under the Notes including the Offered Notes._**

Center Parcs has consolidated indebtedness that is substantial in relation to its shareholders’ equity. After
giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, Center Parcs’ pro forma total debt as at the Ninth Closing Date amounts
to approximately £2,193 million. In addition, Center Parcs (and the Issuer) may incur further indebtedness under, or
permitted by, the terms and conditions of the Class A Notes (the “Class A Conditions”), the terms and conditions of
the Class B Notes (the “Class B Conditions”) and the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements. Center Parcs’ relatively
high level of debt could:

      - make it more difficult for Center Parcs to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreements and ultimately for the Issuer to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Notes;

      - increase Center Parcs’ vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including
rises in interest rates;

      - restrict Center Parcs from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

      - along with the financial and other restrictive covenants under Center Parcs’ indebtedness, limit its
ability to obtain additional financing, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends other than as permitted
in accordance with the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements;

      - require Center Parcs to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to service its
indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund future working capital, capital
expenditures, other general corporate requirements and dividends;

      - require Center Parcs to sell or otherwise transfer assets used in its business in order to fund its debt
service obligations;

      - limit Center Parcs’ flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry
in which it operates;

      - place Center Parcs at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;
and

      - increase its cost of borrowing.

Any failure to pay amounts due and payable under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements could give rise to
an event of default or a Share Enforcement Event (in the case of the Class B Loans) and the Borrower Security Trustee
may, in such circumstances, elect to declare all amounts outstanding under those agreements to be immediately due
and payable and initiate enforcement proceedings against the collateral provided by Center Parcs to secure its
obligations under such agreements.

The consequences of a Share Enforcement Event are that the Borrower Security Trustee will be entitled, by
notice, to enforce the Topco Share Security in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of the Class
B Noteholders. See “Risks relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency”.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ ability to
satisfy its debt obligations, including the Offered Notes.

**_Restrictive covenants in the Transaction Documents governing the Class A Loans and the Class B Loans may_**
**_adversely affect the operations of Center Parcs._**

The Transaction Documents limit the Obligors’ ability, among other things, with respect to:

      - the incurrence or guarantee of additional indebtedness;

      - the payment of dividends or other distributions on, and the redemption or repurchase of, its equity;

54


-----

      - the making of certain restricted payments and investments;

      - the incurrence of certain liens;

      - the imposition of restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends and other payments to
members of the Group;

      - the transfer, lease, sale or other disposition of certain assets;

      - the merger, consolidation with, or sale of substantially all of the Group’s assets to, other entities;

      - the entry into certain transactions with affiliates;

      - the entry into sale and leaseback transactions; and

      - the impairment of the security interest for the noteholders.

In addition, the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement includes other more restrictive covenants and may
restrict the Obligors’ ability to prepay their other indebtedness, including the Class B Loans, while indebtedness under
the Class A Loans remain outstanding. The ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond
the Borrowers’ control.

The restrictions contained in the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements could:

      - limit the Obligors’ ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions or meet capital needs or
otherwise restrict their respective activities or business plans; and

      - adversely affect the ability to finance the Obligors’ operations, strategic acquisitions, investments
or alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in Center
Parcs’ interest.

A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the minimum FCF DSCR
requirements in the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements could result in a default or (in the case of the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) a Share Enforcement Event.

**_Loan Events of Default may occur without the knowledge of the Borrower Security Trustee if the Borrowers fail_**
**_to notify the Borrower Security Trustee of such event._**

The Borrower Deed of Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge provide that the Borrower Security Trustee
will be entitled to assume, unless it is otherwise disclosed in any investor report or compliance certificate or the
Borrower Security Trustee is expressly informed otherwise, that no Loan Event of Default or Potential Loan Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing. The Borrower Security Trustee will not itself monitor whether any such event
has occurred. As the Issuer is a special purpose company, it will fall to the Obligors themselves to make these
determinations as well as the determinations of the financial and operational positions underlying them, which may
be subjective. The Borrower Security Trustee shall not be obliged to make any such determinations and shall be able
to conclusively rely on any investor report or compliance certificate provided to it without being obliged to enquire as
to the accuracy or validity of any such investor report or compliance certificate.

**_The Class B7 Notes are contractually subordinated to the Class A Notes as to payment and rank junior to the_**
**_Class A Notes with respect to the application of enforcement proceeds, other than in respect of the Topco Security._**
**_As a result, the Issuer may be unable to make payments on the Class B7 Notes when due._**

Pursuant to the applicable payment waterfall set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, payments to be made
to the holders of the Class B Notes in respect of principal and interest thereon will be contractually subordinated to
corresponding payments to be made to holders of the Class A Notes. Likewise, principal and interest payments to be
made on the Class B Loans will be contractually subordinated to payments to be made on or under the Class A Loans
and the Liquidity Facility, among other things. Furthermore, subject to certain limited exceptions, the Obligors will
not be permitted to make any payments, including interest payments, under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement, and consequently in respect of the Class B Notes, unless funded out of new equity, and consequently the
Issuer may not be able to make corresponding interest payments on the Class B7 Notes if the Class A Restricted
Payment Condition is not satisfied, including if the Class A FCF DSCR falls below 135%.

55


-----

Furthermore, the Class B7 Notes rank junior to the Class A Notes, and debt outstanding under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement ranks junior to debt outstanding under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement
and the Liquidity Facility, among others, in each case in respect of the application of any amounts realised through
the enforcement of the security granted under the Issuer Security Documents and the Borrower Security Documents,
respectively. Accordingly, the proceeds of any enforcement of such security may not be sufficient to meet the
Obligors’ payment obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or the Issuer’s payment obligations
with respect to the Class B7 Notes following the application of such proceeds towards the full repayment of Center
Parcs’ prior ranking debt described above. However, the Class B7 Notes benefit from the Topco Payment Undertaking
and the Topco Security, which security will not be shared with the Class A Notes. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements — Topco Payment Undertaking” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —_
_Topco Security Agreement.”_

In addition, for so long as the Class A Notes and the Class A Loans are outstanding, the holders of the Class
B7 Notes will not be able to declare a Class B Note Event of Default or a Class B Loan Event of Default.

See “— Risks Relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency,” “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements — Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement”_ and “Description of the Class B7 Loan” for further
details.

**_Topco is a holding company and will depend upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the_**
**_Topco Payment Undertaking._**

Topco is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other than
investments its subsidiaries. Topco will depend upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries to meet its
obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking, pursuant to which Topco has undertaken to pay to the Borrower
Security Trustee all principal, interest and other amounts outstanding under the Class B Loans then outstanding in
certain circumstances, including in the event that the Class B7 Loan is not repaid in full on the Class B7 Loan Expected
Maturity Date. If Topco’s subsidiaries do not, or are unable to, distribute cash to Topco in an amount sufficient to
enable Topco to meet its obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking, Topco will not have any other source of
funds that would allow it to make the necessary payments to the Borrower Security Trustee. Failure by Topco to make
such payments will give the right to the Borrower Security Trustee (on instruction from the Class B Note Trustee or,
as the case may be, the Class B Noteholders) to enforce the Topco Share Security over the shares Topco holds in CP
Cayman Limited and the share security granted to the Borrower Security Trustee by CP Cayman Limited over the
shares it holds in Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited. The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will also restrict the ability of Topco’s subsidiaries to move cash within the Group.
Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of Topco’s subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or
distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. Any such inability to transfer cash within the
Group may mean that even though the relevant entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to enable Topco
to meet its obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking, they may not be permitted to make the necessary
transfers from one entity to another in order to make payments, directly or indirectly, to Topco. Accordingly, Center
Parcs can provide no assurances that Topco will be able to meet its obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking
should the need arise. In addition, the Topco Payment Undertaking is limited in recourse to the Topco Secured
Property and after enforcement of the Topco Security Documents, Topco’s obligations under the Topco Payment
Undertaking will be deemed to be discharged in full. If amounts outstanding under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement have not been paid in full following the enforcement of the Topco Security, such amounts will remain
outstanding and holders of the Class B5 Notes, the Class B6 Notes, and the Class B7 Notes will not be entitled to call
a Class B Loan Event of Default until the earlier of the day on which all amounts outstanding under the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement are paid in full or the Class B5 Note Final Maturity Date, the Class B6 Note Final
Maturity Date, and the Class B7 Note Final Maturity Date, as applicable.

**_Center Parcs may not be able to redeem: (i) the Class B5 Notes in full on the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity_**
**_Date, which falls 24 years earlier than the Class B5 Note Final Maturity Date; (ii) the Class B6 Notes in full on_**
**_the Class B6 Note Expected Maturity Date, which falls 24 years earlier than the Class B6 Note Final Maturity_**
**_Date; or (iii) the Class B7 Notes in full on the Class B7 Note Expected Maturity Date, which falls 26 years earlier_**
**_than the Class B7 Note Final Maturity Date and thereafter, interest on the Class B5 Notes, the Class B6 Notes, and_**
**_the Class B7 Notes, as applicable, will be deferred._**

The Issuer’s ability to redeem the Class B5 Notes in full on the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date will
depend on the repayment in full of the Class B5 Loan by the Borrowers on the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date.

56


-----

The Issuer’s ability to redeem the Class B6 Notes in full on the Class B6 Note Expected Maturity Date will depend
on the repayment in full of the Class B6 Loan by the Borrowers on the Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date. The
Issuer’s ability to redeem the Class B7 Notes in full on the Class B7 Note Expected Maturity Date will depend on the
repayment in full of the Class B7 Loan by the Borrowers on the Class B7 Loan Expected Maturity Date. This, in turn,
will depend on many factors beyond the Issuer’s or Center Parcs’ control, including general economic conditions and
financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, together with the other risks described in this Offering
Memorandum. As a result, there can be no guarantee that Center Parcs will have sufficient funds available to repay:
(i) the Class B5 Loan on the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date and consequently that the Issuer will have
sufficient funds to redeem the Class B5 Notes in full on the Class B6 Note Expected Maturity Date; (ii) the Class B6
Loan on the Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date and consequently that the Issuer will have sufficient funds to
redeem the Class B6 Notes in full on the Class B6 Note Expected Maturity Date; or (iii) the Class B7 Loan on the
Class B7 Loan Expected Maturity Date and consequently that the Issuer will have sufficient funds to redeem the Class
B7 Notes in full on the Class B7 Note Expected Maturity Date. The Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date is on 28
August 2026, while the Class B5 Note Final Maturity Date is on 28 February 2050. The Class B6 Note Expected
Maturity Date is on 28 August 2027, while the Class B6 Note Final Maturity Date is on 28 August 2051. The Class
B7 Note Expected Maturity Date is on 28 August 2029, while the Class B7 Note Final Maturity Date is on 28 August
2055.

Furthermore, the yield to maturity of the the Class B5 Notes, the Class B6 Notes, and the Class B7 Notes
will depend on, among other things, the amount and timing of repayment and prepayment of principal on the the Class
B5 Loan, the Class B6 Loan, or the Class B7 Loan, as applicable, and the price paid by the holders of the Class B5
Notes, the Class B6 Notes, and the Class B7 Notes, as applicable. Such yield may be adversely affected by a higher
or lower than anticipated rate of prepayment on the Class B5 Loan, the Class B6 Loan, or the Class B7 Loan, as
applicable. Timing for prepayment of the Class B5 Loan, the Class B6 Loan, or the Class B7 Loan cannot be predicted
and will be influenced by a wide variety of factors, as described above.

Accordingly, Center Parcs can provide no assurance with respect to timing of prepayments on the Class B5
Loan, the Class B6 Loan, or the Class B7 Loan or as to amounts to be prepaid and consequently the yield to maturity
of the Class B5 Notes, the Class B6 Notes, and the Class B7 Notes.

**_Sale of a Propco may have an adverse effect on the ability of the Borrowers to meet their obligations under the_**
**_Loans and ultimately affect the repayments on the Notes by the Issuer._**

Under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Obligors are permitted, subject to certain
conditions, to undertake sale and leaseback transactions in respect of one or more holiday parks. In each such case,
provided that the relevant conditions are satisfied, the Borrower Security Trustee will be required to give its consent
to the disposal, to the release of the property interest held by the relevant Propco, and (if the relevant Propco is also
being disposed of at the same time) to the release of the relevant Propco from its obligations, and from the security
interests granted by it, under the Transaction Documents.

Under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, these conditions include (but are not limited to) (a) the
requirement to prepay, pro rata, the then outstanding Class A Loans, together with any applicable premium payable
at that time in respect of a consequential redemption of the Class A Notes and (b) that the Class A Noteholders (voting
as a single class) have approved the entry into the relevant transaction in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Note Trust Deed. A further condition which must be met is that the Borrower Security Trustee is
satisfied (by virtue of a Rating Agency Confirmation or a Ratings Assessment) that the then ratings of the Class A
Notes will not be (i) downgraded (ii) withdrawn or (iii) publicly placed on review for possible downgrade, as a result
of the relevant sale and leaseback transaction. See “Description of Other Indebtedness — Class A Issuer/Borrower
_Loan Agreement” for a fuller description of the conditions which must be satisfied in order for the Obligors to be_
entitled to undertake sale and leaseback transactions in respect of the holiday parks. There are no restrictions under
the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement to undertake a sale and leaseback.

There is a risk that the potential benefits (in particular financial de-leveraging) of any sale and leaseback
transaction may not be fully realised as initially anticipated. In particular, there is a risk that rent increases (although
required to be capped at an average of 4% per annum) may become a financial burden for the Obligors which
eventually affects the Issuer’s ability to make payments of principal and interest under the Class A Notes and the Class
B Notes.

57


-----

Further, there is a risk that following a sale and leaseback of a Propco or a holiday park to a third party, such
lease might be terminated or forfeited by the relevant landlord with negative consequences for the Obligors. Risks
might arise such as the Obligors losing the use of a site and finding difficulty in locating a comparable replacement,
loss of income from the relevant holiday park and the introduction of competition to the remaining holiday parks
secured in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee through the development of the forfeited site as an alternative
holiday destination.

**_Challenges by secured creditors of the financing transactions described in this Offering Memorandum could have_**
**_a negative impact on other secured creditors._**

The financing transactions described in this Offering Memorandum have been structured based on English
law and practice as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum. It is possible that a secured creditor which is
subject to laws other than the laws of England and Wales may seek to challenge the validity and/or enforceability of
one or more features of the financing structure under the local laws of such creditor’s jurisdiction. Potential investors
should be aware that the outcome of any such challenge may depend on a number of factors, including but not limited
to, the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than England and Wales. There can be no assurance that any
challenge would not adversely affect directly or indirectly the rights of the other secured creditors, including the
holders of Class B7 Notes, the market value of the Class B7 Notes and/or the ability of the Issuer to make interest and
principal payments on the Class B7 Notes.

**_Center Parcs is exposed to the creditworthiness of third party financial institutions._**

The creditworthiness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, derivative,
trading, clearing or other relationships among the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened
defaults by, one institution (or more) could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or
defaults by other institutions. This may adversely affect the financial institutions, such as banks and insurance
providers, with which Center Parcs interacts on a regular basis, and therefore could adversely affect its ability to raise
needed funds or access liquidity. See “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and_ “Description of other
_Indebtedness.”_

**RISKS RELATING TO TAXATION**

**_Change of tax law and practice might have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Issuer or the Obligors._**

The structure of the transaction, the issuance of the Offered Notes, the ratings that are to be assigned to them
and the statements in relation to taxation set out in this Offering Memorandum are based on current law and the
published practice of the relevant authorities in force or applied as at the date of this Offering Memorandum. Any
changes in such law or practice might have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Issuer or the Obligors
and no assurance can be given as to the effect of any possible judicial decision or change of law or the administrative
practice of any jurisdiction after the date of this Offering Memorandum.

**_Potential secondary tax liabilities of the members of the Obligor Group may result in a deterioration of the_**
**_Borrowers’ financial condition which may, in turn, result in a deterioration of the Issuer’s financial condition._**

Where a company fails to discharge certain tax liabilities due and payable by it within a specified time period,
UK tax law imposes, in certain circumstances (including where that company has been sold so that it becomes
controlled by another person), secondary liability for those overdue taxes on other companies that are or have been
members of the same group of companies, or are or have been under common control, for tax purposes with the
company that has not discharged its tax liabilities.

Bidco Parent, Bidco, CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited, Topco, CP Cayman Limited and the Obligors have each
undertaken in the Tax Deed of Covenant that no steps have been or will be taken by it or any other member of the
Group which could be expected to give rise to a secondary tax liability for the Borrowers. If any secondary tax
liabilities arise in the Borrowers (whether in respect of a primary tax liability of a member of the Obligor Group or of
another company with which the Borrowers are or have been grouped or under common control for UK tax purposes),
and those secondary tax liabilities are not discharged by Bidco Parent, Bidco, CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited, Topco,
CP Cayman Limited or any other member of the Obligor Group, and are of significant amounts, the financial condition
of the Borrowers could be adversely affected.

58


-----

As a general matter, where companies are treated as members of a VAT group, any supply of goods or
services made by or to any member of the group (other than any such supply which is made by or to another member
of the group) is treated as made by or to the representative member of that group. CP Opco (in its capacity as the
representative member of the VAT group) is, therefore, the person required to account to H.M. Revenue & Customs
(HMRC) for any VAT chargeable on any supply made by or to any member of the VAT group (to or by any person
other than another member of the VAT group). All the other members of the VAT group are jointly and severally
liable for any VAT due from CP Opco to HMRC during their period of membership of the group. CP Opco (in its
capacity as the representative member of the VAT group) has undertaken in the Tax Deed of Covenant that it has paid
and will continue to pay all VAT payable by it to HMRC and to comply with all laws and regulations relating to VAT.
However, if such payments are not made and are of significant amounts, this may have a material adverse effect on
Center Parcs’ financial condition and results of operations. No company which is not an Obligor is a member of the
VAT group of which CP Opco is the representative member.

**_Borrowers’ UK tax position may change which may adversely affect the ability of the Borrowers to repay the_**
**_Class A Loans and Class B Loans and so the ability of the Issuer to repay the Offered Notes._**

There can be no assurance that UK tax law and practice will not change in a manner that would adversely
affect the ability of the Borrowers to repay amounts of principal and interest under the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements. Similarly, UK tax law and practice can be subject to differing interpretations and the Borrowers’
interpretation of the relevant tax law as applied to their transactions and activities may not coincide with that of HMRC.
As a result, transactions of the Borrowers may be challenged by HMRC and any profits of the Borrowers from their
activities in the UK may be assessed to additional tax, interest and/or penalties which may adversely affect the ability
of the Borrowers to repay amounts of principal and interest under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements. If, in turn,
the Issuer does not receive all amounts due from the Borrowers under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements, the
Issuer may not have sufficient funds to enable it to meet its payment obligations under the Offered Notes and/or any
other payment obligations ranking in priority to, or equally with, the Offered Notes. See also – “The application of
_UK tax law could affect the Borrowers’ ability to obtain tax deductions for all their finance expenses which could_
_have an adverse effect on their financial position and their ability to meet their payment obligations under the_
_Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements”._

**_The payments on the Loans may be subject to withholding tax which may result in a prepayment of the Loans, and_**
**_so an early redemption of the Offered Notes, and may also impact on the Borrowers’ ability to repay the Loans in_**
**_full, and so the Issuer’s ability to repay the Offered Notes in full._**

The Borrowers will be required to make payments of interest to the Issuer under the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements without deduction or withholding for or on account of UK income tax if and for so long as the Issuer is
and continues to be a person who is entitled to receive such payments gross of such a deduction or withholding (and
the Borrowers reasonably believe this to be the case). The Issuer has been advised that it was such a person as at the
Closing Date, the Second Closing Date, the Third Closing Date, the Fourth Closing Date, the Fifth Closing Date, the
Sixth Closing Date, the Seventh Closing Date and the Eighth Closing Date and will be such a person as at the Ninth
Closing Date.

In the event that any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax is required to be made from any
payment due to the Issuer under an Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the amount of that payment will be increased
so that, after such withholding or deduction has been made, the Issuer will receive a cash amount equal to the amount
that it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required to be made.

If a Borrower is obliged to increase any sum payable by it to the Issuer as a result of such Borrower being
required to make a withholding or deduction from that payment under an Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the
Borrower will have the option (but not the obligation) to prepay all relevant outstanding advances made under that
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in full. If the Borrower chooses to prepay the advances made under the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer will then be required to redeem the Class A Notes. Such a redemption
would be for a redemption price equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding on the Class A Notes together with any
accrued but unpaid interest. If the Borrower chooses to prepay the advances made under the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement, the Issuer will then be required to redeem the Class B Notes. Such a redemption would be for a
redemption price equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding on the Class B Notes together with any accrued but
unpaid interest. Investors should be aware that no break costs would be payable to the Class B Noteholders (including
holders of the Offered Notes) in such circumstances.

59


-----

If, in circumstances where a Borrower is required to increase payments made to the Issuer under an
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement as a result of any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax, the Borrower
does not have sufficient funds to enable it either to make increased payments to the Issuer or to repay the relevant
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer’s ability to make timely payments of interest and principal under the
Offered Notes could be adversely affected.

**_If the Issuer were to cease to qualify as a securitisation company, this may have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s_**
**_UK tax position, which could adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make timely payment of interest and principal_**
**_under the Notes (including the Offered Notes)._**

The Issuer is incorporated in Jersey and resident for tax purposes in the UK and has been advised that it
should be a “securitisation company” for the purposes of the Taxation of Securitisation Companies Regulations 2006
(SI 2006/3296) (as amended). Accordingly, the Issuer should be subject to corporation tax in the UK on its “retained
profit” only, in accordance with the special regime for securitisation companies as provided for by those regulations.

If the Issuer were to cease to qualify as a securitisation company for the purposes of those regulations, this
may have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s UK tax position, which could adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make
timely payment of interest and principal under the Offered Notes and may result in investors receiving less interest
and/or principal than expected.

**_The application of UK tax law could affect the Borrowers’ ability to obtain tax deductions for all their finance_**
**_expenses which could have an adverse effect on their financial position and their ability to meet their payment_**
**_obligations under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements._**

With effect from 1 April 2017, Part 10 of the Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Act (TIOPA)
contains the “corporate interest restriction” (CIR) rules, which, where applicable, provide for the disallowance for
corporation tax purposes of some or all of the financing expenses, including interest expenses, of UK resident
companies. Under the CIR rules, financing expenses of UK group companies can be non-deductible for corporation
tax purposes by reference to the net-tax interest expense of the “worldwide group” of which they are a member. The
composition of the worldwide group is largely determined by accounting consolidation.

The application of the CIR rules to the Borrowers, and therefore whether any “allocated disallowance” will
arise to them, depends in part on the composition of the “worldwide group” of which they are members. The
composition of the “worldwide group” depends on the accounting group of which the Borrowers form part. Currently,
the Group takes the view that it is not part of the wider Brookfield group for CIR purposes and forms its own worldwide
group. On that basis, the Group expects to use the “group ratio” rather than the “fixed ratio” method for the purposes
of calculating the financing expenses allowance on the basis that the fixed ratio would result in a greater disallowance
for corporation tax purposes of some or all of the financing expenses of UK group companies within the Group. There
can be no assurance that, should the Borrowers’ accounting group change (for example, because of a divestment of
the Center Parcs Group by Brookfield), the rules which prescribe how to determine the relevant account group are the
subject of change, or other facts or circumstances arise which affect the application of the “group ratio” or the “fixed
ratio” to the Group, allocated disallowances would not arise to the Borrowers that would require them to leave out of
account tax-interest expense amounts, which broadly means that some or all of their financing expenses, including
interest, may not be deductible for corporation tax purposes. Similarly, UK tax law and practice can be subject to
differing interpretations and the Borrowers’ interpretation of the CIR rules may be challenged by HMRC.

Part 6A TIOPA contains rules (the Anti-Hybrid Rules) which can disallow financing expenses of UK resident
companies in certain circumstances, in particular where as a result of the application of non-UK tax rules there is a
deductible payment made by a hybrid entity which is also treated as deductible in calculating the net income of another
person. Members of the Group have made elections for US tax purposes which mean that they are treated as transparent
for US tax purposes, and are therefore “hybrid entities” for these purposes. The application of the Anti-Hybrid Rules
to the Group is therefore dependent on the presence of US investors in the Group and the US tax treatment of income
of members of the Group. Based on current facts the Group does not consider that any disallowance under the AntiHybrid Rules is required. However, there can be no assurance that, should the investors in the Group change or the
investment structure change, some of the Group’s financing expenses, including interest, would not be disallowed for
corporation tax purposes.

Other UK tax rules can apply to deny corporation tax deductions in respect of interest and financing expenses
which, on a just and reasonable apportionment, are attributable to a purpose which is not amongst the business or other

60


-----

commercial purposes of the company. The application of these rules, including the manner in which just and
reasonable apportionment should apply where a single loan has more than one purpose, is the subject of ongoing case
law which is subject to appeal. Based on current facts and the current status of the case law, the Group does not
consider than any disallowance of its financing expenses under these ruels is required. However, UK tax law and
practice can be subject to differing interpretations and the Borrowers’ interpretation of these rules may be challenged
by HMRC.

Any of the above scenarios could result in any profits of the Borrowers from their activities in the UK being
assessed to additional tax by reason of a disallowance of corporation tax deductions in respect of financing expenses
which may adversely affect the Borrowers’ post tax cash flows. In the event of a material deterioration in Center
Parcs’ financial condition and result of operations, it is possible that such impact on post tax cash flows may contribute
to an adverse impact on the ability of the Borrowers to repay amounts of principal and interest under the
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements.

**RISKS RELATING TO SECURITY, ENFORCEMENT AND INSOLVENCY**

**_Enforcement of the Topco Share Security is subject to certain conditions which if not met could affect the ability_**
**_of the Class B Noteholders to realise the value of the security._**

Pursuant to the Topco Share Security Agreement, the enforcement of the Topco Share Security is conditional
on the Borrower Security Trustee receiving a tax opinion that confirms that there will not be any actual or contingent
tax liability arising in the Obligor Group as a result of such enforcement of more than £10 million. As at the Ninth
Closing Date, it is not expected that such enforcement would give rise to any tax liability. However, such a liability
may arise in the future due to (among other things) a change in tax law or practice. Should a tax opinion not be
provided giving the requisite confirmations, the Topco Share Security may only be enforced if the Borrower Security
Trustee is provided with sufficient funds, other collateral or other support arrangement to mitigate any such tax liability
to the extent it exceeds £10 million. While the structure of the transaction has been established to minimise the risk of
this event occurring, no assurance can be given by the Obligors that such conditions will be satisfied at the time of
enforcement of the Topco Share Security. As a result, the amounts realised by the Class B Noteholders through
enforcement may be significantly reduced and/or delayed.

**_The enforcement and disposal of the Borrower Secured Property by the Borrower Security Trustee may impact the_**
**_amounts realised by the holders of the Class B5 Notes, the Class B6 Notes and the Class B7 Notes._**

Pursuant to the term of the Intercreditor Agreement, whilst the Class A Notes are outstanding, only the
Class A Noteholders are entitled to direct the Class A Note Trustee, which, in turn, will direct the Issuer Security
Trustee and then the Borrower Security Trustee with regard to the enforcement of any Borrower Security. Neither the
Class A Note Trustee nor the Issuer Security Trustee will be obliged to take into consideration the interests of the
Class B Noteholders when acting in accordance with the directions received from the Class A Noteholders or in
exercising their discretion in relation to enforcement. The Class B Noteholders and any other Secured Creditors will
be required to take any action (for example, release security and/or guarantees) that the Class A Noteholders and/or
the Class A Note Trustee and/or the Issuer Security Trustee (as the case may be) require of them to enforce the
Borrower Security including the extinguishment of all amounts due under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement in connection with an enforcement of the Borrower Security. All amounts realised by the enforcement of
the Borrower Security will be applied in accordance with the relevant Priorities of Payments as stipulated in the
Intercreditor Agreement. There is therefore a risk that the Class B Noteholders’ interests will not be aligned with those
of the Class A Noteholders and that the Class B Note Trustee will be directed to act against the wishes of the Class B
Noteholders, and without their control for so long as the Class A Notes remain outstanding. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement”._

For so long as there are any Class B Notes outstanding, the Borrower Security Trustee may only dispose of
any Borrower Secured Property with a value above £10 million if a fairness opinion from a financial advisor is first
obtained. However, the appointment of a financial advisor in such circumstances by the Borrower Security Trustee
may be directed by the Issuer Security Trustee on behalf of the Class A Noteholders only, and the Borrower Security
Trustee shall not be obliged to take into account the interests of any Secured Creditor (other than the Class A
Noteholders) and may only seek direction from the Issuer Security Trustee on behalf of the Class A Noteholders in
relation to the method and timing of the enforcement of such Borrower Secured Property and any matter relating to
the fairness opinion. In the event that a fairness opinion is not able to be produced, the disposal of any Borrower
Secured Property will be undertaken by way of a competitive marketing and sales process typical for such type of

61


-----

assets. Amounts realised by such a sales process could be less than amounts recovered in a sale by the Borrower
Security Trustee. The fairness opinion will only be required if there are Class B Notes outstanding.

In addition, upon the occurrence of a Loan Event of Default, the Borrower Security Trustee has the power to
appoint an administrative receiver who would take control of all the assets of the English Obligors. Such receiver has
wide powers that would enable him to control the English Obligors and manage Center Parcs’ business in order to
repay the secured debt. In relation to the Propcos, the receiver could endeavour to dispose of the properties, in whole
or in part, either: (i) through the sale of the Borrower Secured Property itself; or (ii) by the sale of the shares in the
Propco through enforcing the share pledge over the shares in the Propco.

In respect of any proposed disposal of the Borrower Secured Property, whether by an administrative receiver
appointed in respect of a Propco or otherwise, the relevant Borrower Secured Property could be sold subject to the
terms of the relevant headlease and the related documentation.

In respect of Longleat, the related documentation provides that the headleases (except the headlease of the
Keepers Cottage activity centre) may be transferred with the consent of the immediate landlord and the superior
landlord. However, in the case of the superior landlord, the documentation does not provide that such consent may
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Prior to any transfer of the Keepers Cottage activity centre headlease, the
Borrower Security Trustee is required to offer to surrender the headlease to the superior landlord who has ten working
days to accept a surrender of the Keepers Cottage headlease at the price stipulated in the surrender offer. Therefore, a
receiver or the Borrower Security Trustee may not be able to dispose of the Longleat property directly through a sale
of the property itself or via a special purpose vehicle unless the superior landlord was prepared to give its consent to
the assignment of the Longleat headleases on reasonable terms and does not exercise its pre-emption right in respect
of the Keepers Cottage activity centre. However, there is no restriction on a sale of the shares in the Longleat Propco.
Therefore, in such a scenario, the options available to an administrative receiver could be limited and this could
adversely affect the value which could be achieved on a sale of the Longleat property, although, as noted, this would
not prevent the disposal of the shares in the Longleat Propco to a purchaser.

**_The Borrower Security Trustee will only enforce the Borrower Security if it is instructed to do so by the requisite_**
**_percentage of Class A Noteholders or Class B Noteholders, as the case may be._**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the relevant Instructing Group will be entitled to direct the
relevant trustee to enforce and/or accelerate the Borrower Security or Issuer Security (as applicable). In the case of
any enforcement and/or acceleration of any Borrower Security and Issuer Security, if the Instructing Group is the
Class A Noteholders, then a direction may only be given if such direction is in writing by the holders of at least 25%
in aggregate of the principal amount outstanding of any class of the Class A Notes then outstanding or if so directed
by a resolution of any class of the Class A Noteholders. In the case of the Topco Security (and the Borrower Security
and the Issuer Security, if the Instructing Group is the Class B Noteholders), then a direction may only be given if
such direction is in writing by the holders representing at least 30% in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the
Class B Notes then outstanding. There can be no guarantee that the interests of different sub-classes of the Class B
Notes will be aligned or that conflicts of interests will not arise between different sub-classes of the Class B Notes in
relation to instructing the Borrower Security Trustee to enforce the Borrower Security.

**_Guarantees and security may constitute a transaction at an undervalue or preference._**

A liquidator or administrator appointed in England over an Obligor could apply to the court to unwind the
issuance of that Obligor’s guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believed that issuance of such constituted a
transaction at an undervalue. The Obligor Group believes that each guarantee will not be a transaction at an undervalue
and that each guarantee will be provided in good faith for the purposes of carrying on the business of each Obligor
and its subsidiaries and that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the transactions will benefit each such
Obligor. However, there can be no assurance that the provision of the guarantees will not be challenged by a liquidator
or administrator, or that a court would support the Obligor Group analysis.

If the liquidator or administrator can show that any of the Obligor Group or one of the Obligors have given
a “preference” to any person within six months of the onset of liquidation or administration (or two years if the
preference is to a “connected person”) and, at the time of the preference, that Obligor Group or that Obligor were
unable to pay their debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 or became unable to do so as
a result of the preferential transaction, a court has the power, among other things, to void the preferential transaction.
For these purposes, a company gives preference to a person if that person is one of the company’s creditors (or a surety
or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) and the company takes an action which has the effect of

62


-----

putting that person into a position which, in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation, will be better
than the position that person would have been in if that thing had not been done. The court may not make an order
avoiding a preferential transaction unless it is satisfied that the company was influenced by a desire to put that person
in a better position. This provision of English insolvency law may affect transactions entered into or payments made
by any of the Obligors during the relevant period prior to the liquidation or administration of such Obligor.

In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by a company was made for less than fair value
and was entered into for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of creditors, then the transaction may be set
aside as a transaction defrauding creditors. Any person who is a “victim” of the transaction, and not just liquidators
or administrators, may assert such a claim. There is no statutory time limit within which a claim must be made
(although the normal provisions under the Limitation Act 1980 will apply) and the company need not be insolvent at
the time of the transaction. The Obligors do not believe that they have entered into any transactions which may be
regarded as being for less than fair value or for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of their creditors.

**_The Borrower Security Trustee may be liable to third parties if recharacterised as a mortgagee in possession._**

The Borrower Security Trustee may be deemed to be a mortgagee in possession if there is physical entry into
possession of any village, a step-in enforcement of security or an act of control or influence which may amount, in
effect, to possession.

A mortgagee in possession may incur liabilities to third parties in nuisance and negligence and, under certain
statutes (including environmental legislation), can incur the liabilities of a property owner. The Borrower Security
Trustee has the absolute discretion, at any time, to refrain from taking any action under the Transaction Documents,
including becoming a mortgagee in possession in respect of a village unless it is satisfied at that time that it is
adequately indemnified. Subject to being adequately indemnified under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Borrower Security Trustee ranks first in respect of the Priorities of Payments, both prior to and following an event of
default thereunder, in respect of payment of any amounts owed to it under its indemnity, including in respect of the
liabilities described in this paragraph.

**_Certain Obligors and the Issuer are incorporated in jurisdictions other than England and Wales and therefore may_**
**_be subject to overseas insolvency law on the security enforcement process._**

_Centre of Main Interests_

While Center Parcs (Jersey) 1 Limited (the “Jersey Obligor”) and the Issuer are incorporated in Jersey, they
are each a tax resident in the United Kingdom (from where they are controlled and all management functions are
operated).

Given the fact that the Issuer and the Jersey Obligor are managed and operated from England, and that this
is ascertainable to a third party creditor (such that the creditor would assume their COMI was in England), it is likely
that the Issuer’s and the Jersey Obligor’s centre of main interests (as defined in the Insolvency (England and Wales)
Rules 2016) (“COMI”) is in England as opposed to Jersey and any insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer
could be commenced in England and conducted in accordance with the requirements of English insolvency laws. If
this is the case at the time the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened, the Issuer and the Jersey Obligor may be
subject to English administration, company voluntary arrangement, or certain liquidation proceedings. This is because
under the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) the location of a debtor’s
COMI in England and Wales remains one of the bases upon which the English courts can decide to open insolvency
proceedings. Alternatively, English insolvency law may also be applicable to the Issuer and the Jersey Obligor if a
request for assistance is made by the Jersey court to the English court under section 426 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

Even if the Issuer’s or the Jersey Obligor’s COMI were in England, or section 426 of the Insolvency Act
1986 applied, it is unlikely that it will be possible to appoint an administrative receiver in respect of the Issuer or the
Jersey Obligor in England (so as to prevent the appointment of an English administrator) using the capital market
exemption described in more detail below. This is because notwithstanding the fact that their COMI may be in
England, neither the Issuer nor the Jersey Obligor is likely to be considered to be a “company” for the purposes of
section 29 of the Insolvency Act 1986 since it is not formed under one of the UK Companies Acts.

If insolvency proceedings were to be opened in a place other than England and Wales, such proceedings
could be in parallel to proceedings opened in England. Such proceedings would not benefit from automatic recognition
in England—although the officeholder could apply under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations (as defined
below) which provide that foreign (i.e. non-English) insolvency proceedings may be recognised where a company has

63


-----

its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity
with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction.

The UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency was implemented, subject to certain modifications,
in Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 4 April 2006 by The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, SI
2006/1030 (the “UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations”). The UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations apply
where: (i) assistance is sought in Great Britain by a foreign court or a foreign representative in connection with a
foreign proceeding, or (ii) assistance is sought in a foreign state in connection with a proceeding under British
insolvency law, or (iii) a foreign proceeding and a proceeding under British insolvency law in respect of the same
company are taking place concurrently or (iv) creditors or other interested parties in a foreign state have an interest in
requesting the commencement of, or participating in, a proceeding under British insolvency law.

Under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations, if foreign insolvency proceedings (defined to be
collective judicial or administrative proceedings in a foreign state, including an interim proceeding pursuant to a law
relating to insolvency in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the company are subject to control or supervision
by a foreign court, for the purpose of reorganisation or liquidation) are commenced in respect of a company, then,
upon application by the foreign insolvency officeholder and provided that certain requirements are met, the English
courts are required to recognise such proceedings. Any such recognition may in effect impact upon the availability of
certain types of creditor action in England and Wales and/or, provided certain further requirements are met, result in
the application of English avoidance (including claw-back) provisions.

In addition, if the relevant foreign insolvency proceedings are recognised as “foreign main proceedings”, an
automatic mandatory stay on certain types of creditor action (including the commencement or continuation of certain
legal proceedings) will apply in England and Wales and the right of the company to transfer, encumber or otherwise
dispose by the company of its assets will be suspended. In general, this stay will not restrict rights relating to the
enforcement of security or set-off (so long as these rights could be exercised in an English winding-up). However, the
foreign officeholder may also make an application to an English court to exercise its discretion to provide further
relief, including the imposition of a wider stay (which may extend to restrictions on the rights referred to above),
particularly if the foreign proceedings in question are reorganisation proceedings which, under the foreign insolvency
law, give rise to a stay on security enforcement.

_Cayman Insolvency Law_

Pursuant to section 145 of the Companies Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands (the "Companies Act"),
any security or charge made, incurred, taken or suffered by a debtor company in favour of a creditor at a time when
the debtor company was unable to pay its debts (within the meaning of section 93 of the Companies Act) and with a
view to giving such creditor a preference over the other creditors shall be voidable upon the application of the debtor
company's liquidator if made, incurred, taken or suffered within 6 months immediately preceding the commencement
of liquidation. A charge granted in favour of a related party within six months of the debtor company's winding up
will be deemed to have been made with a view to giving such creditor a preference - this is not rebuttable. A creditor
shall be treated as a 'related party' if it has the ability to control the debtor company or exercise significant influence
over the company in making financial and operating decisions.

Pursuant to section 147 of the Companies Act, if in the course of the winding up of a company it appears that
any business of the company has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any
other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the liquidator may apply to the Court for a declaration that any persons
who were knowingly parties to the carrying on of such business are liable to make such contributions to the company’s
assets as the Court thinks proper.

If an antecedent transaction (for example pursuant to section 145 or 147 of the Companies Act) has occurred,
a liquidator may commence a proceeding against the directors of Topco or CP Cayman Limited for breach of fiduciary
duty to act in the best interests of Topco or CP Cayman Limited (as the case may be) in approving the grant of the
relevant security by Topco or CP Cayman Limited. If the recipient of any assets under such security receives the same
with actual or constructive knowledge of such breach by the directors of Topco or CP Cayman Limited, such recipient
may be held to be a constructive trustee of such payment or assets and liable to return the same.

A Cayman Islands court may treat a purported fixed charge over assets as a floating charge if the company
has sufficient authority to deal with its assets in the course of its business and/or if the holder of security does not
exercise sufficient control over the relevant assets. Any charge in the nature of a floating charge will rank behind any
subsequent fixed mortgage or charge or lien which is created prior to the crystallisation of the floating charge.

64


-----

However, advice has been taken from Cayman Islands counsel that subject to standard reservations and assumptions,
the Topco Share Security Agreement will create a valid security interest over the property intended to be secured by
such agreement in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee and the courts in the Cayman Islands will recognise such
security interests.

In the case of a winding up of a Cayman Islands company in a jurisdiction other than the Cayman Islands,
the priority of any security granted by or over the assets of that Cayman Islands company may be affected by any
provision of the laws of that jurisdiction as to the priority of claims in a winding-up. To the extent that the security is
held in the Cayman Islands, failure to comply with any restrictions or provisions applicable to the granting of security
over any such assets or the transfer thereof, whether arising under Cayman Islands law generally or pursuant to specific
documentation relating to such security, may, among other things, affect the validity, priority or enforceability of such
security interest.

**_Cayman Islands securities law and law regarding the fiduciary responsibilities of Topco or CP Cayman Limited's_**
**_directors are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions._**

Each of Topco and CP Cayman Limited is an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under
the laws of the Cayman Islands. The corporate affairs of each of Topco and CP Cayman Limited will be governed by
its memorandum and articles of association and the Companies Act of the Cayman Islands and other laws of the
Cayman Islands. The rights of the Borrower Security Trustee to take action against the directors of Topco or CP
Cayman Limited and the fiduciary responsibilities of the directors of Topco and CP Cayman Limited to Topco and
CP Cayman Limited respectively under Cayman Islands law are, to a large extent, governed by the common law of
the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from judicial precedent in the Cayman
Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of English courts being of persuasive authority, but not
binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The fiduciary responsibilities of the directors of Topco and CP Cayman
Limited under Cayman Islands law may not be as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial
precedent in some jurisdictions such as the United States. Furthermore, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body
of securities laws thus providing significantly less protection to investors as compared to other jurisdictions such as
the United States, which has more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of securities law.

It is expected that CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited, CP Cayman Midco 2 Limited and CP Cayman Limited will
be migrated to Bermuda by way of a continuation under the provisions of the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda (the
“Bermuda Companies Act”). The Bermuda Companies Act provides that, upon continuance of a foreign corporation
as a Bermuda company under the Bermuda Companies Act, (a) the property of the foreign corporation continues to
be the property of the Bermuda company; (b) the Bermuda company continues to be liable for the obligations of the
foreign corporation; (c) any existing cause of action, claim or liability to prosecution in respect of the foreign
corporation is unaffected; (d) any civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding pending by or against the
foreign corporation may be continued by or against the Bermuda company; and (e) any conviction against, or any
ruling, order or judgment in favour of or against the foreign corporation may be enforced by or against the Bermuda
company.

Following such migration, the corporate affairs of each of CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited, CP Cayman Midco
2 Limited and CP Cayman Limited will be governed by its memorandum of continuance and by-laws and the Bermuda
Companies Act and other laws of Bermuda. The rights of the Borrower Security Trustee to take action against the
directors of CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited, CP Cayman Midco 2 Limited or CP Cayman Limited and the fiduciary
responsibilities of the directors of CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited, CP Cayman Midco 2 Limited and CP Cayman
Limited to CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited, CP Cayman Midco 2 Limited and CP Cayman Limited respectively under
Bermuda law are governed by the Bermuda Companies Act and the common law of Bermuda. The common law of
Bermuda is derived in part from judicial precedent in Bermuda as well as from English common law, the decisions of
English courts being of persuasive authority, but not binding on a court in Bermuda. The fiduciary responsibilities of
the directors of CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited, CP Cayman Midco 2 Limited and CP Cayman Limited under Bermuda
law may not be as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions such
as the United States. Furthermore, Bermuda has a less developed body of securities laws thus providing significantly
less protection to investors as compared to other jurisdictions such as the United States, which has more fully
developed and judicially interpreted bodies of securities law.

**_Fixed security interests may be recharacterised as floating security interests due to the degree of control exercised_**
**_over certain underlying assets, including over bank accounts, and as a result the full proceeds of enforcement may_**
**_not be available to repay the Class B5 Notes, the Class B6 Notes and the Class B7 Notes._**

There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the
security documents governed by English law could take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as
fixed charges is not determinative.

Whether the fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security
interests will depend, among other things, on whether the Borrower Security Trustee or, as the case may be, the Issuer
Security Trustee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant assets and exercises that control in practice.

Each Borrower has established a number of bank accounts into which, among other things, rental income and
disposal proceeds in respect of the relevant villages must be paid. Each Borrower has, pursuant to the terms of the
Borrower Deed of Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge, granted security over all of its interests in its relevant
accounts, which is, other than in the case of certain operating accounts, expressed to be a first fixed charge.
Furthermore, under the Issuer Deed of Charge, the Issuer has granted security over all of its bank accounts, which
security is also expressed to be fixed security.

Although the various bank accounts are stated to be subject to various degrees of control, there is a risk that,
if the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee (as applicable) does not exercise the requisite degree
of control over the relevant accounts in practice, a court could determine that the security interests granted in respect
of those accounts take effect as floating security interests only and that the security interests granted over the assets
from which the monies paid into the accounts are derived also take effect as floating security interests only,
notwithstanding that the security interests are expressed to be fixed. In such circumstances, monies paid into accounts
or derived from those assets could be diverted to pay preferential creditors, the costs of the insolvency process, and
certain other liabilities were a receiver, liquidator or administrator to be appointed in respect of the relevant company
in whose name the account is held. Where the charging company is free to deal with the secured assets or their proceeds
in the course of its business without the consent of the charge holder, a court is likely to hold that the security interest
in question constitutes a floating charge, whatever its other characteristics, notwithstanding that in the security
document the security interest may be expressed in words that indicate an intention to create a fixed security interest.

If the fixed security interests are recharacterised as floating security interests, the claims of (i) the unsecured
creditors of the relevant Obligor incorporated in England and Wales (or otherwise subject to insolvency proceedings
in England and Wales) or, as the case may be, the Issuer in respect of that part of the relevant Obligor’s net property
which is ring-fenced as a result of the Enterprise Act 2002 (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the
relevant Obligor, and (iii) in circumstances where a restructuring moratorium has been entered into by the relevant
Obligor under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act 1986 and administration or liquidation commences within 12 weeks of
the end of that moratorium, moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts, may have priority over the rights of
the Borrower Security Trustee or the Issuer Security Trustee, as the case may be, to the proceeds of enforcement of
such security in accordance with s176A and 174A of the Insolvency Act 1986. To the extent that the assets of the
Issuer or any Obligor are subject only to a floating charge (including any fixed charge recharacterised by the courts
as a floating charge), in certain circumstances under the provisions of sections 174A, 176ZA and 176A of the
Insolvency Act 1986, certain floating charge realisations which would otherwise be available to satisfy the claims of
secured creditors under the Issuer Deed of Charge or the Borrower Deed of Charge or the Woburn Deed of Charge
may be first used to satisfy any expenses of the insolvency proceeding, claims of unsecured creditors (up to an amount
equal to £800,000 in respect of each relevant Obligor) or creditors who otherwise take priority over floating charge
recoveries. As a result, the full amount of the proceeds of enforcement of the security may not be available to repay
the Notes.

Further, the costs and expenses of a liquidation or administration (including corporation tax on capital gains)
will be payable out of floating charge assets in priority to the claims of the floating charge-holder. Upon the
enforcement of the floating charge security granted by an Obligor subject to an English liquidation or administration,
floating charge realisations which would otherwise be available to satisfy the claims of secured creditors under the
Issuer Deed of Charge and/or the Borrower Deed of Charge and/or the Woburn Deed of Charge will be reduced by at
least a significant proportion of any liquidation or administration expenses. If an Obligor was eligible to, and did, enter
into a restructuring moratorium and subsequently entered into administration or liquidation within 12 weeks from the
end of the moratorium, the moratorium debts and certain “priority pre-moratorium debts” would have super priority
and rank ahead of expenses of an administration or liquidation and preferential debts. However, as there are broad

66


-----

exclusions for companies which are party to a capital markets arrangement, the moratorium is not available to an
Obligor.

**_Floating charges given by the English Obligors may be deemed invalid for lack of consideration which would_**
**_hinder the appointment of an administrative receiver._**

Section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by
a company may be invalid in whole or in part. If a floating charge is held to be wholly invalid then it will not be
possible to appoint an administrator or administrative receiver of such company and, therefore, it will not be possible
to prevent the appointment of an administrator of such company by another party. The risk is, if a liquidator or
administrator is appointed to the Issuer or the relevant Obligor within a period of one year (or two years if the
transaction is with a connected person) (the “relevant time”) commencing upon the date on which the Issuer or that
Obligor, as the case may be, grants a floating charge, the floating charge granted by the Issuer or that Obligor, as the
case may be, will be invalid pursuant to section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986 except to the extent of the consideration
received by the relevant chargor at the time of or after the creation of the floating charge. The Issuer received
consideration (namely, the Issuer issued the Original Class A Notes and the Original Class B Notes on the Closing
Date, the Second Class A Notes on the Second Issue Date, the Class B2 Notes on the Third Closing Date, the Further
Class A4 Notes and the Class B4 Notes on the Fourth Closing Date, the Class B5 Notes on the Sixth Closing Date,
the Class B6 Notes on the Seventh Closing Date and the Class A6 Notes and the Class A7 Notes on the Eighth Closing
Date and has received the subscription monies therefor) and each of the Obligors will have received such consideration
(namely, the Borrowers made drawings under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements on the Closing Date, under the
Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement on the Second Closing Date, under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement on the Third Closing Date, under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements on the Fourth Closing Date under
the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement on the Sixth Closing Date, under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement on the Seventh Closing Date and under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement on the Eighth
Closing Date). As such, during the relevant time the floating charge granted by the Issuer will be valid to the extent
of the amount of Notes issued by the Issuer, the floating charges granted by the Borrowers will be valid to the extent
of the amount drawn by the Borrowers under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements and the floating charge granted
by each of the other Obligors will be valid to the extent of the fee paid to the other Obligors but not valid for the full
amount of the property charged. However, such limitation on the validity of the floating charges will not necessarily
affect the ability of the Borrower Security Trustee to appoint an administrative receiver provided that the floating
charge still extends and is valid in relation to substantially all of the respective Obligor’s property in respect of the
English Obligors — however, this will be a factual question to be determined at the time of a potential appointment
and the availability of this remedy is discussed in further detail below. After the relevant time it will not be possible
for the floating charges granted by each of the Issuer, the Borrowers or the English Obligors to be invalidated under
section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

It should be noted that, since the Jersey Obligor and the Issuer are incorporated in jurisdictions other than
England and Wales, it will not be possible to appoint an administrative receiver in respect of these entities in England
(so as to prevent the appointment of an English administrator) using the capital markets provisions referred to below.
Accordingly, if the Issuer’s and the Jersey Obligor’s COMI were found to be in England, they could be placed into
administration. However, it should be noted that the Issuer is structured to be “bankruptcy remote” so therefore it
should not be subject to any insolvency proceedings. The main asset-owning Obligors (namely CP Opco, CP Woburn
Opco and the Propcos) and their immediate parent companies are all English companies so therefore administrative
receivership is possible for these companies.

**_The ability of the Borrower Secured Creditors to appoint an administrative receiver may be hindered by the_**
**_application of the Enterprise Act 2002 in respect of floating charges._**

The provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the “Enterprise Act”) restrict the right of the holder of a floating
charge to appoint an administrative receiver (unless the security was created prior to 15 September 2003 or an
exception applies) and instead give primacy to collective insolvency procedures (in particular, administration).

The Insolvency Act 1986 contains provisions that continue to allow for the appointment of an administrative
receiver in relation to certain transactions in the capital markets. The relevant exception provides that the appointment
of an administrative receiver is not prohibited if it is made in pursuance of an agreement which is or forms part of a
capital market arrangement (as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986) under which a party incurs or, when such
agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £50,000,000 and the arrangement involves the
issue of a capital market investment (also defined in the Insolvency Act 1986, but generally a rated, listed or traded

67


-----

debt instrument). This exception should be applicable to floating charges created by the English Obligors and assigned
by way of security to the Borrower Security Trustee. However, as this issue is partly a question of fact, were it not
possible to appoint an administrative receiver in respect of one or more of the English Obligors, they would be subject
to administration if they were to become insolvent.

It should be noted that, since the Foreign Obligors and the Issuer are incorporated in jurisdictions other than
England and Wales, it is unlikely that it will be possible to appoint an administrative receiver in respect of these
entities in England (so as to prevent the appointment of an English administrator) using the capital markets provisions.
Accordingly, if the Issuer’s and the Foreign Obligors’ COMI were found to be in England, they could be placed into
administration. However, it should be noted that the Issuer is structured to be “bankruptcy remote” so therefore it
should not be subject to any insolvency proceedings. The main asset-owning Obligors (namely CP Opco, CP Woburn
Opco and the Propcos) and their immediate parent companies are all English companies so therefore administrative
receivership is possible for these companies.

The UK Secretary of State may, by secondary legislation, modify the exceptions to the prohibition on
appointing an administrative receiver and/or provide that the exception shall cease to have effect. No assurance can
be given that any such modification or provision in respect of the capital market exception, or its ceasing to be
applicable to the transactions described in this Offering Memorandum, will not be detrimental to the interests of the
Class B Noteholders.

**_The ability of certain members of the Obligor Group to seek a moratorium which could restrict creditors’ ability to_**
**_enforce security._**

Pursuant to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, which received Royal Assent on
25 June 2020 and came into effect on 26 June 2020, a free-standing moratorium is available to protect certain
companies, both UK and overseas if there is a sufficient connection with England, from creditor action for a specified
period, granting a ‘payment holiday’ for ‘pre-moratorium debts’. Pre-moratorium debts are debts due prior to the
moratorium coming into force or debts which become due during the moratorium if they relate to obligations incurred
before the moratorium comes into force. The moratorium is similar in scope to that which applies in administration,
preventing security enforcement and legal proceedings amongst other things. In order to be eligible for the moratorium
a member of the Obligor Group must be or likely to be unable to pay its debts and the moratorium must be likely to
result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. However, there are broad exclusions including for companies
which are party to a capital markets arrangement. As a result, the moratorium is not available to members of the
Obligor Group.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE OFFERED NOTES**

**_The Offered Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors._**

Each potential investor in the Offered Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its
own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

      - have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Offered Notes,
the merits and risks of investing in the Offered Notes and the information contained in this Offering
Memorandum;

      - have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its
particular financial situation, an investment in the Offered Notes and the impact the Offered Notes
will have on its overall investment portfolio;

      - have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the
Offered Notes, including Offered Notes where the currency for principal or interest payments is
different from the potential investor’s currency;

      - understand thoroughly the terms of the Offered Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any
relevant indices and financial markets; and

      - be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial advisor) possible economic and
interest rate scenarios and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the
applicable risks.

68


-----

The Offered Notes are complex financial instruments. Sophisticated institutional investors generally do not
purchase complex financial instruments as standalone investments. They purchase complex financial instruments as a
way to reduce risk or enhance yield with an understood, measured and appropriate addition of risk to their overall
portfolios. A potential investor should not invest in Offered Notes that are complex financial instruments unless it has
the expertise (either alone or with a financial advisor) to evaluate how the Offered Notes will perform under changing
conditions, the resulting effects on the value of the Offered Notes and the impact this investment will have on the
potential investor’s overall investment portfolio.

In addition, the market value of the Offered Notes may fluctuate for a number of reasons including due to
prevailing market conditions, current interest rates and the perceived creditworthiness of the Issuer and the Obligors.
Any perceived threat of insolvency or other financial difficulties of the Obligors or a less favourable outlook of the
holiday industry in the UK could result in a downgrade of ratings and/or a decline in market value of the Offered
Notes.

**_The Issuer is a special purpose company with no business operations or assets._**

The Offered Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer. The Issuer is a special purpose company
with no business operations other than the issuance of the Notes and the transactions ancillary thereto. The Offered
Notes are not obligations or responsibilities of, or guaranteed by, any other entity.

The Offered Notes are not obligations or responsibilities of, and are not guaranteed by, the Class A Note
Trustee, the Class B Note Trustee, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners,
the Liquidity Facility Providers, the Cash Manager, the Paying Agents, the Class A Registrar, the Class B Registrar,
the Class A Transfer Agent, the Class B Transfer Agent, the Issuer Account Bank, the Borrower Account Bank, the
Borrower Security Trustee, any of the Obligors or any company in the same group of companies as, or affiliated to,
the Parent (other than the Issuer itself but without prejudice to the Obligors’ obligations to the Issuer under the
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements). Furthermore, no such person other than the Issuer will accept any liability
whatsoever to holders of the Offered Notes in respect of any failure by the Issuer to pay any amounts due under the
Offered Notes.

The ability of the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Offered Notes will be dependent on:

(a) the receipt by it of funds from the Obligors under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;
and

(b) the receipt by it of interest (if any) from monies standing to the credit of the Issuer Transaction
Account, or otherwise from certain Eligible Investments (each as defined below) made by it or on
its behalf.

**_The Class B Notes are subordinated to the Class A Notes and rank behind the Class A Notes as to payment and_**
**_security._**

Pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, payments to be made to the Class B Noteholders
in respect of principal and interest in relation to the Class B Notes, including the Class B7 Notes, will be subordinated
to payments in respect of the Class A Notes in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payments. The Obligors
will not permitted to pay interest due and payable on Class B Loans and subsequently the Issuer will not be able to
make payments on the Class B Notes in the event that the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is no longer satisfied
on any Note Interest Payment Date (unless such payment is made using New Equity Funds received for this purpose).

Furthermore, the Class B Noteholders have limited ability to call a Class B Note Event of Default and a Class
B Loan Event of Default and rank behind the Class A Noteholders in respect of any amounts realised through the
enforcement of security granted under the Issuer Deed of Charge or the Borrower Deed of Charge or the Woburn
Deed of Charge. There is a risk that the proceeds of an enforcement of security at either the Borrowers’ level or the
Issuer level will not be sufficient to meet the Issuer’s payment obligations with respect to the Class B Notes following
the full repayment of its obligations under the Class A Notes. Furthermore, in certain Class A Loan enforcement
scenarios, Class B Loans may be extinguished — see the section “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —
_Intercreditor Agreement”. However, the Class B Notes indirectly benefit from the Topco Payment Undertaking and_

69

first ranking security under the Topco Share Security — see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —
_Topco Payment Undertaking — Topco Share Security Agreement”._

See “Risks relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency”, “Description of other Indebtedness — Class A
_Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement” and “Description of the Class B7 Loan” for further details._

**_Risks in relation to the proceeds received from the enforcement of the Topco Security Documents for the Class B_**
**_Loans and Class B Notes._**

Pursuant to the Topco Payment Undertaking, Topco will undertake to pay or procure the payment of an
amount equal to the aggregate of: (i) the then principal balance of the Class B Loans; (ii) accrued but unpaid interest
outstanding in respect of the Class B Loans, Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon; (iii) any Additional Amounts; and (iv) all other amounts due and payable under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, on the earlier of (A) the date on which any amount under a Class B Loan remains
outstanding at the close of business on the Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date for such Class B Loan and (B) the
date on which Topco receives a valid demand notice from the Borrower Security Trustee following the occurrence of
a Share Enforcement Event and/or a Class B Loan Event of Default. In addition, Topco will grant as security all of its
shares in CP Cayman Limited in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee to hold for the benefit of the Issuer under
the Topco Security Documents. CP Cayman Limited will then grant as security all of its shares in Center Parcs
(Holdings 1) Limited in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee to hold for the benefit of the Issuer under the CP
Cayman Security Agreement.

The Borrower Security Trustee on behalf of the Issuer will be entitled to enforce the Topco Security
Documents upon any Share Enforcement Event pursuant to the Transaction Documents. Such enforcement by the
Borrower Security Trustee will not constitute either a Class A Note Event of Default, or a Class B Note Event of
Default. If, for example, upon the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event, the Borrower Security Trustee enforces
the Topco Security Documents, the Obligor Group could be owned by a different entity. Any such change in ownership
of the Obligor Group would not constitute a change of control under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements but may
have an adverse effect on the business and administration of Center Parcs and may affect the Borrowers’ ability to
make repayments on the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements when they fall due and as such affect the ability of the
Issuer to repay both the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes.

If a Share Enforcement Event has occurred and is continuing only the Class B Instructing Group (acting upon
a resolution passed by the holders representing at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Class
B Notes then outstanding) may direct the Issuer Security Trustee to require the Borrower Security Trustee to enforce
the Topco Security. There can be no guarantee that the interests of different sub-classes of the Class B Notes will be
aligned or that conflicts of interests will not arise between different sub-classes of the Class B Notes in relation to
instructing the Borrower Security Trustee to enforce the Topco Security.

No assurance can be given that the proceeds realised as a result of an enforcement of any Topco Security
Documents will be sufficient to discharge in full the amounts due on the Class B7 Loan and as a result the Class B7
Notes, nor that the holders of the Class B7 Notes will not be adversely affected by such realisation or enforcement.
See “Risks relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency”.

**_Center Parcs may not be able to repurchase the Offered Notes upon a Class B Change of Control with respect to a_**
**_series of Offered Notes and it may not be certain that a Class B Change of Control has occurred or will occur. In_**
**_addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Class B7 Notes_**
**_in connection with a tender offer even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting
a “change of control”. Upon a Class B Change of Control under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement with
respect to any Offered Notes, the Borrowers will be required to make an offer to repurchase all the outstanding Offered
Notes of such series at a premium, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. In such a situation,
the Borrowers may not have enough funds to repurchase all of the outstanding Offered Notes. In addition, by virtue
of provisions in the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Obligors may be prohibited from repurchasing the
Offered Notes upon a Class B Change of Control. A Class B Change of Control in this regard may cause disruption
to the Center Parcs Group and may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Class B7 Loan and agreements
governing any future indebtedness. As a result of such events occurring, the Class B7 Loan and any future
indebtedness may be accelerated.

70


-----

For the purposes of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, a “change of control” will include a
disposition of all or substantially all the assets of Topco and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain
third parties. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be
a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction in fact involves a disposition of “all or substantially all”
the assets of Topco and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Class
B Change of Control has occurred and with respect to the Offered Notes whether Center Parcs will be required to
make an offer to repurchase all the Offered Notes at the price described above. In addition, a Class B Change of
Control with respect to the Offered Notes is only be deemed to have been triggered if, along with the occurrence of a
“change of control”, the current rating of the Offered Notes is downgraded.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Class B7 Notes, if holders of not less than 90 per
cent. in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B7 Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such
Class B7 Notes in such tender offer and a Borrower purchases all of the Class B7 Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such holders, the Borrowers may prepay the remaining principal amount of the Class B7 Loan, in whole,
but not in part, at a price equal to the purchase price offered to holders of the Class B7 Notes pursuant to such tender
offer and the Issuer will be required to apply the proceeds received from such prepayment to redeem a corresponding
principal amount of Class B7 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, at a redemption price corresponding to the
prepayment price. See ““Description of the Class B7 Loan—Prepayment—Optional Prepayment”.

**_The holders of the Offered Notes will rank behind certain third parties in respect of certain obligations of the Issuer_**
**_and the Borrowers._**

Although the Issuer Security Trustee will hold the benefit of the Issuer Security on trust for the holders of
the Offered Notes and the Borrower Security Trustee will hold the benefit of the Borrower Security on trust for the
Borrower Secured Creditors, such security interests will also be held on trust for certain third parties. Certain
obligations of the Issuer to third parties will rank ahead of the holders of the Offered Notes. Such persons include,
among others, the Class B Note Trustee (in its individual capacity), the Class A Note Trustee (in its individual
capacity), the Issuer Security Trustee (in its individual capacity), the Liquidity Facility Providers, the Paying Agents
and the Issuer Account Bank in respect of certain amounts owed to them. To the extent that significant amounts are
owing to any such persons, the amounts available to the holders of the Offered Notes will be reduced. Likewise, certain
of the Borrowers’ obligations to certain third parties will rank ahead of their obligations to the Issuer.

In addition, unsecured creditors of the Borrowers, such as trade creditors and suppliers, while subordinate to
the Borrower Secured Creditors, are not bound into the financing structure as they are not parties to the Borrower
Deed of Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge and so will be able to proceed directly against each of the Borrowers
where they fail to pay any unsecured debts as they fall due. For a more detailed description of the Priorities of Payments
by the Issuer and by the Borrowers both prior and subsequent to the enforcement of the security thereunder, see
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Issuer Deed of Charge” and “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement”._

**_The Issuer is dependent on third parties for the provision of certain services in relation to the Offered Notes._**

The Issuer is a party to contracts with a number of third parties who have agreed to perform certain services
in relation to, among other things, the Offered Notes. For example, the Issuer English Corporate Services Provider
and the Issuer Jersey Corporate Services Provider have agreed to provide various corporate services to the Issuer and
to the Issuer Parent, and the Cash Manager, the Issuer Account Banks and the Paying Agents have agreed to provide,
among other things, payment, administration and calculation services in connection with the Offered Notes. In the
event that any relevant third party fails to perform its obligations under the respective agreements to which it is a party,
the holders of the Offered Notes may be adversely affected.

**_The interests of Center Parcs’ principal shareholder may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Offered_**
**_Notes._**

The interests of Center Parcs’ principal shareholder, in certain circumstances, may conflict with the interests
of the holders of the Offered Notes. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Brookfield Funds own
approximately 99% of Center Parcs’ shares and certain employees and members of management own the remainder.
See “Principal Shareholder”. As a result, the Brookfield Funds have, directly or indirectly, the power, among other
things, to affect Center Parcs’ legal and capital structure and Center Parcs’ day-to-day operations, as well as the ability

71


-----

to elect and change Center Parcs’ management and board of directors and to approve any other changes to Center
Parcs’ operations. For example, the Brookfield Funds could decide to cause Center Parcs to incur additional
indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The interests of the Borrowers’ ultimate shareholders could
conflict with the holders of the Offered Notes’ interests, particularly if they encounter financial difficulties or are
unable to pay their debts when due. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase Center Parcs’ debt
service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce Center Parcs’ ability to generate revenue, each of which
could adversely affect holders of the Offered Notes.

**_There may be conflicts of interest between the holders of the different classes of the Notes and the Issuer may not_**
**_be able to repay the Offered Notes._**

The Class B Note Trustee will be required to have regard only to the interest of the holders of existing Class
B Notes and new Class B Notes issued after the Ninth Closing Date as if they formed a single class with existing Class
B Notes when exercising his powers, trusts, authorities, duties and discretions (except in certain circumstances as set
out in the Note Trust Deed). Holders of each class of Notes may find their voting powers diluted by the creation of
new Notes and/or any further Notes.

The Class A Noteholders and Class B Noteholders each indirectly benefit from the covenant package given
by the Obligors in relation to each of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement. Each of the Class A Noteholders and/or Class B Noteholders may waive any breach of covenant
specific to those covenants given in their respective Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement without the consent of the
alternate class of Noteholders. There is a risk therefore that the Class A Noteholders may waive or amend the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement without regard to the consequences for the holders of the Offered Notes.
Additionally, where new Class A Notes and/or Further Class A Notes are issued, there is an increased risk that the
Offered Notes may not be fully repaid by the Issuer.

**_The Class A Note Trustee may modify certain provisions of, or otherwise make decisions with respect to the Offered_**
**_Notes without consent of the holders of the Offered Notes._**

The Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee)
will be entitled to agree, without the consent of the relevant Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders and any
other Issuer Secured Creditors, with the Issuer and any other relevant party to any of the Issuer Transaction Documents
in making any modification to the Class A Conditions, the Class B Conditions, the Note Trust Deed (other than (in
the case of (c) and (d) below) in respect of either a Class A Basic Terms Modification or a Class B Basic Terms
Modification), the Class B5 Notes, the Class B6 Notes, the Class B7 Notes, or any other Issuer Transaction Documents
to which it is a party or over which it has security, or may give its consent to any event, matter or thing, if:

(a) in its opinion, the interest of the Class A Noteholders would not be materially prejudiced thereby;
or

(b) in its opinion, such modification is required to correct a manifest error or is of a formal, minor,
administrative, or technical nature or one in respect of which the English court could reasonably be
expected to make a rectification order; or

(c) to the extent such event, matter or thing relates to an Entrenched Right and in its opinion, such
modification is required to correct a manifest error or is of a formal, minor, administrative or
technical nature; or

(d) it is required or permitted, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions, under the terms of the
Class A Conditions, the Class B Conditions or the Issuer Transaction Documents provided such
conditions are satisfied.

The Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee)
shall be entitled to determine, in its own opinion, for the purposes of exercising any right, power, trust, authority, duty
or decision under or in relation to the Class A Notes (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class
B Note Trustee in relation to the Offered Notes), the Class A Conditions (or following the full redemption of the
Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee in relation to the Class B Conditions) or any of the Issuer Transaction
Documents, that such exercise will not be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class A Noteholders (or
following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the holders of Class B5 Notes, Class B6 Notes, and/or Class B7
Notes, as applicable) or any relevant class thereof and in making such a determination shall be entitled to take into

72


-----

account, amongst any other things it may consider necessary and/or appropriate in its absolute discretion, any
confirmation by the Rating Agencies (if available) that the then current rating of the Class A Notes (or following the
full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B5 Notes, Class B6 Notes, and/or the Class B7 Notes, as applicable),
or as the case may be, the relevant class thereof will not be downgraded, withdrawn or qualified, and that, where any
original rating of the Class A Notes (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B5 Notes, Class
B6 Notes, and/or the Class B7 Notes, as applicable) has been and continues to be downgraded, restoration of such
original rating would not be prevented, as a result of such exercise. For the avoidance of doubt, such rating
confirmation or non-receipt of such rating confirmation shall, however, not be construed to mean that any such action
or inaction (or contemplated action or inaction) or such exercise (or contemplated exercise) by the Class A Note
Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee) of any relevant right, power,
trust, authority, duty or decision under or in relation to the Class A Notes (or following the full redemption of the
Class A Notes, Class B5 Notes, Class B6 Notes, and/or the Class B7 Notes, as applicable), the Class A Conditions (or
following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Conditions) or any other Issuer Transaction Documents
is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the Class A Notes or, as the case may be, that Class of
Notes and the non-receipt of such ratings confirmation shall not be construed to mean that such exercise by the Class A
Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee) as aforesaid is
materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class A Noteholders or, as the case may be, the Notes of the relevant
Class.

The Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee)
may, without the consent or sanction of the Class A Noteholders, the holders of the Offered Notes or any other Issuer
Secured Creditors, authorise or waive any proposed breach of the covenants or provisions contained in the Note Trust
Deed, the Class A Notes, the Offered Notes, or any other Issuer Transaction Documents or determine that a Class A
Note Event of Default and/or a Class B Note Event of Default shall be treated as such if certain conditions are satisfied.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness — Class A Notes” and “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes”.

**_The Issuer Security Trustee and the Borrower Security Trustee may modify certain provisions of, or otherwise_**
**_make decisions with respect to the Issuer Transaction Document and the Borrower Transaction Document without_**
**_consent of the holders of the Offered Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that in connection with the accession of any Additional Site and
issue of any additional Notes or making any additional loans, any consequential amendments, consents or waivers
required to be made or granted pursuant to any Transaction Document to give effect to such transaction or transactions
will not (a) constitute an Entrenched Right and so not require the consent of any Affected Secured Creditor (and such
Affected Secured Creditor may be any of the holders of the Offered Notes) to effect such changes and (b) will not
constitute a General Matter and so will not require the consent of the relevant Instructing Group (and such relevant
Instructing Group may be any of the holders of the Offered Notes) to effect such changes. The Issuer Security Trustee
and the Borrower Security Trustee will be authorised to execute any documents and to give effect to such changes
without incurring any liability for doing so.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Borrower Security Trustee in respect of a Borrower
Transaction Document and the Issuer Security Trustee in respect of an Issuer Transaction Document may approve an
amendment, waiver or consent in respect of such document if it is of the opinion that the relevant action is formal,
minor, administrative or technical, or one in respect of which the English court could reasonably be expected to make
a rectification order (“Relevant Action”). In such circumstances, such Relevant Action may be taken without the
consent of the holders of the Offered Notes, the Issuer Secured Creditors or the Borrower Secured Creditors. The
Relevant Action may be taken in respect of an Entrenched Right.

The Issuer Security Trustee, Borrower Security Trustee, the Class A Note Trustee and Class B Note Trustee
will each not liable for the failure by the Clearing Systems to deliver notices to holders of the Offered Notes in a timely
manner.

In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and certain other Transaction Documents, the Issuer
Security Trustee and the Borrower Security Trustee will have various powers, authorities and discretions to agree to
amendments to certain provisions and to the taking of certain steps by the Obligors without the consent of the Borrower
Secured Creditors or the Issuer Secured Creditors (as applicable). See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement — Amendments, Consents and Waivers — General Procedures”._

73


-----

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer Security
Trustee may concur with the Obligor Group Agent in making any amendment to give any consent under, or grant any
waiver in respect of, any breach or proposed breach which is not, in the opinion of the Borrower Security Trustee,
materially prejudicial to the interests of the Borrower Secured Creditors, or in the opinion of the Issuer Security Trustee
(as applicable) is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Issuer Secured Creditors (and in the case of any
holders of the Offered Notes in their capacity as Issuer Secured Creditors, where the Class B Note Trustee is of the
opinion that the relevant amendment, consent or waiver is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders of
the Offered Notes).

**_Holders of the Class B7 Notes will have recourse to any additional villages that Center Parcs constructs or acquires_**
**_in the United Kingdom only if and when certain conditions under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement_**
**_are satisfied following completion of the development of such additional villages. These conditions may not be_**
**_satisfied when expected, or at all._**

The revenues derived from any additional village that Center Parcs constructs or acquires in the United
Kingdom will not benefit the Restricted Group unless and until certain conditions in the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements that allow accession of additional sites to the Restricted Group are satisfied and the formal accession
process is completed. Furthermore, the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements will allow the Obligors, subject to various
conditions, to raise further debt in the form of additional loans to fund the accession of additional sites to the Obligor
Group.

The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement provides that the Borrowers must use all reasonable
endeavours to procure the accession of the relevant additional village site in the United Kingdom within three years
of either the acquisition of the relevant additional village or the additional village becoming operational and starting
to receive paying guests, whichever is later. The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement further provides (among
other things) that if the market conditions are such that the accession of the relevant additional village to the Obligor
Group would not be executable in a “commercially reasonable manner (having regard to the then expected pricing for
such acquisition)” then the Borrowers will not be required to procure accession at that time but as soon as possible
after that time. See “Description of Other Indebtedness — Class A IBLA — Additional Site Entities”.

While the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will not require the satisfaction of similar conditions,
so long as the Class A Notes are outstanding, the holders of the Class B7 Notes will not have recourse to any additional
villages in the United Kingdom unless the conditions under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement are satisfied.
Accordingly, unless and until the accession conditions are satisfied and any relevant additional village located in the
United Kingdom is transferred to the Obligor Group in accordance with the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,
the business that supports interest and principal on the Notes may be negatively impacted by any such additional
village without receiving any benefits or income expected to be derived from the additional village. Accordingly,
development and operation of any additional village in the United Kingdom may materially and adversely affect the
Obligors’ financial condition, results of operations and the Obligors’ ability to pay interest and principal on the Notes.

In addition, none of the Obligors will own assets relating to, or derive revenues from, Longford Forest or any
other additional village outside the United Kingdom. Holders of the Class B7 Notes will not have recourse to any such
village outside the United Kingdom, its assets, revenues or cash flow. See “—Holders of the Class B Notes will not
_have recourse to any additional village outside the United Kingdom, its assets, revenues or cash flow. Development_
_of any such village may divert management’s time from villages in the United Kingdom.”_

**_Regulatory initiatives may result in increased regulatory capital requirements and/or decreased liquidity in respect_**
**_of the Offered Notes._**

In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there has been increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the assetbacked securities industry in recent years. This has resulted in numerous measures for increased regulation which are
currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge
to certain investors in certain securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to invest in securities
issued under such structures, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.

Holders of the Offered Notes should consult their own advisers as to the consequences to, and effect on, them
of the application of Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (together “CRD”), Regulation (EU)
No. 231/2013 (the “AIFM Regulation”) and Article 254 of Regulation (EU) No. 35/2015 (the “Solvency II
**Regulation”), each as implemented by their own regulator, to their holding of any Class B7 Notes. The Issuer will**
not responsible for informing holders of the Offered Notes of the effects of the changes to risk-weighting which will

74


-----

result for investors from the adoption of CRD, the AIFM Regulation and the Solvency II Regulation by their own
regulator.

**_The Offered Notes will be new securities for which there is no established trading market._**

The Offered Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no market. The Class B Global
Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners may make a market in the Offered Notes as permitted by applicable laws and
regulations; however, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners are not obligated to make a market in
the Offered Notes and they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore,
Center Parcs cannot assure any investor as to the development or liquidity of any trading market for the Offered Notes.
The liquidity of any market for the Offered Notes will depend on a number of factors, including:

      - the number of holders of the Offered Notes;

      - the operating performance and financial condition of Center Parcs;

      - the market for similar securities;

      - the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Offered Notes; and

      - prevailing interest rates.

Historically, the debt capital markets have been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility
in the prices of securities similar to the Offered Notes. Center Parcs cannot assure investors that the market, if any,
for the Offered Notes will be free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect the
prices at which the investors may sell the Offered Notes. Therefore, Center Parcs cannot assure investors that they
will be able to sell the Offered Notes at a particular time nor that the Offered Notes will receive a favourable price
from such sale. Consequently, investors in the Offered Notes should be aware that they may have to hold the Offered
Notes until their maturity.

In addition, the market value of the Offered Notes may fluctuate with changes in prevailing rates of interest,
market perceptions of the risks associated with the Offered Notes, supply and other market conditions. Consequently,
any sale of Offered Notes by the holders of the Offered Notes in any secondary market which may develop may be at
a discount to the original purchase price of such Offered Notes.

**_Rating Agency assessments, downgrades and changes to Rating Agencies’ criteria may result in ratings volatility_**
**_on the Offered Notes, or may not reflect all the risks associated with an investment in the Offered Notes._**

The ratings assigned to the Offered Notes by S&P and Fitch address the likelihood of full and timely payment
to the holders of the Offered Notes of all payments of interest due on each Note Interest Payment Date and the full
repayment of principal of the Offered Notes on or before the relevant final maturity date. There is no assurance that
any such ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be reviewed, revised, suspended or withdrawn
entirely by the Rating Agencies as a result of changes in or unavailability of information or if, in the Rating Agencies’
judgement, circumstances so warrant. Rating organisations other than the Rating Agencies could seek to rate the
Offered Notes and, if such “unsolicited ratings” are lower than the comparable rating assigned to the Offered Notes
by the Rating Agencies, such “shadow ratings” could have an adverse effect on the value of the Offered Notes.

In addition, future events, including events affecting Center Parcs, could have an adverse impact on the
ratings of the Offered Notes (as to which, see “— Risks Relating to the Financing Structure — Sale of a Propco may
_have an adverse effect on the ability of the Borrowers to meet their obligations under the Loans and ultimately affect_
_the repayments on the Notes by the Issuer”.)_

Where a particular matter (including the determination of material prejudice by the Class B Note Trustee)
involves each of S&P and Fitch being requested to confirm that a proposed action would not result, in the case of
S&P, in a downgrade or a CreditWatch placement, or in the case of Fitch, in the downgrade of the then current rating
of the Offered Notes, such confirmation is given at the sole discretion of the relevant Rating Agency. Depending on
the timing of delivery of the request and any relevant information, there is a risk that the relevant Rating Agency
cannot provide its confirmation in the time available or at all. No Rating Agency will be responsible for the
consequences of any failure to deliver a Ratings Assessment or confirmation on any particular timescale.

Confirmation, if given, will be given on the basis of the facts and circumstances prevailing at the relevant
time, and in the context of cumulative changes to the transaction of which the Offered Notes form part since the Ninth

75


-----

Closing Date. A confirmation of ratings represents only a restatement of the opinions given at the Ninth Closing Date,
and cannot be construed as advice for the benefit of any parties to the transaction or as confirmation that an event or
amendment is in the best interest of, or not materially prejudicial to the interests of, the holders of the Offered Notes.
No assurance can be given that a requirement to seek a ratings confirmation will not have a subsequent impact upon
the business of the Issuer.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Issuer Security Trustee, Borrower Security
Trustee, the Class A Note Trustee and the Class B Note Trustee will acknowledge that they do not have any right of
recourse to or against either Rating Agency in respect of a Ratings Assessment which either the Issuer Security Trustee
or Borrower Security Trustee relies upon.

Reliance by the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee on any Ratings Assessment will not
create, impose on or extend to either Rating Agency any actual or contingent liability to any person (including, without
limitation, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee and/or any holders of the Class B7 Notes) or
create any legal relations between Fitch and the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee, the Class A
Global Coordinator and Arranger, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners, any Noteholder or any
other person whether by way of contract or otherwise.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision,
suspension or withdrawal at any time by the assigning Rating Agency. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact
of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value
of the Offered Notes.

In general, European regulated investors are restricted under the CRA Regulation from using credit ratings
for regulatory purposes in the EEA, unless such ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the EEA
and registered under the CRA Regulation (and such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended, subject to
transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances). Such general restriction will also apply in the case of credit
ratings issued by third country non-EEA credit rating agencies, unless the relevant credit ratings are endorsed by an
EEA-registered credit rating agency or the relevant third country rating agency is certified in accordance with the
CRA Regulation (and such endorsement action or certification, as the case may be, has not been withdrawn or
suspended, subject to transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances). The list of registered and certified
rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) on its website in accordance
with the CRA Regulation is not conclusive evidence of the status of the relevant rating agency included in such list,
as there may be delays between certain supervisory measures being taken against a relevant rating agency and the
publication of the updated ESMA list.

Investors regulated in the UK are subject to similar restrictions under the UK CRA Regulation. As such, UK
regulated investors are required to use for UK regulatory purposes ratings issued by a credit rating agency established
in the UK and registered under the UK CRA Regulation. In the case of ratings issued by third country non-UK credit
rating agencies, third country credit ratings can either be: (a) endorsed by a UK registered credit rating agency; or (b)
issued by a third country credit rating agency that is certified in accordance with the UK CRA Regulation. Note this
is subject, in each case, to (a) the relevant UK registration, certification or endorsement, as the case may be, not having
been withdrawn or suspended, and (b) transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances.

If the status of the rating agency rating the Offered Notes changes for the purposes of the CRA Regulation
or the UK CRA Regulation, relevant regulated investors may no longer be able to use the rating for regulatory purposes
in the EEA or the UK, as applicable, and the Offered Notes may have a different regulatory treatment, which may
impact the value of the Offered Notes and their liquidity in the secondary market. Certain information with respect to
the credit rating agencies and ratings is set out on the cover of this Offering Memorandum.

In respect of a disposal of a Propco or a holiday park owned by a Propco made pursuant to the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, a Ratings Assessment is required to be obtained from each of S&P and Fitch. If
either Rating Agency delivers such a Ratings Assessment, such Ratings Assessment will be prepared and delivered
by either Rating Agency on the following limited basis:

(a) a Ratings Assessment will be a point-in-time assessment which:

(i) will not constitute a credit rating by either Rating Agency;

76


-----

(ii) will not be monitored by either Rating Agency and therefore will not be updated to reflect
changed circumstances or information that may affect the Ratings Assessment; and

(iii) will not address other matters that may be of relevance to the Noteholders,

and such Ratings Assessment will be issued on the basis that the Issuer Security Trustee, the
Borrower Security Trustee and each Noteholder will be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed
to the above terms;

(b) none of the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee or any Noteholder will have any
right of recourse to or against either Rating Agency in respect of a Ratings Assessment which is
relied upon by the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee; and

(c) reliance by the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee on any Ratings Assessment
will not create, impose on or extend to either Rating Agency any actual or contingent liability to any
person (including, without limitation, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee
and/or any Noteholder) or create any legal relations between either Rating Agency and the Issuer
Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee, the Class A Global Coordinator and Arranger, the
Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners, any Noteholder or any other person whether
by way of contract or otherwise.

The Offered Notes have a denomination consisting of a minimum authorised denomination of £100,000 plus
higher integral multiples of £1,000 up to £199,000. Accordingly, it is possible that the Offered Notes may be traded
in amounts in excess of the minimum authorised denomination that are not integral multiples of such denomination.
In such a case, if Definitive Notes are required to be issued, a Noteholder of the Offered Notes who holds a principal
amount less than the minimum authorised denomination at the relevant time may not receive a Definitive Note in
respect of such holding and may need to purchase a principal amount of Offered Notes such that their holding amounts
to the minimum authorised denomination (or another relevant denomination amount).

If Definitive Notes are issued, holders of the Offered Notes should be aware that Definitive Notes which have
a denomination that is not an integral multiple of the minimum authorised denomination may be illiquid and difficult
to trade.

**_Offered Notes in book-entry form are subject to the rules of Euroclear and Clearstream, respectively, which may_**
**_not be adequate to ensure the owners their timely exercise of rights under the Offered Notes._**

The Offered Notes will initially only be issued in global form and deposited with a common depository for
Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests in the Global Note trade in book-entry form only. The common depository, or its
nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream, is the sole holder of the Global Note. Accordingly, owners of book-entry
interests must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, and non-participants in Euroclear
or Clearstream, Luxembourg, must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interests,
to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Offered Notes.

Unlike the holders of the Offered Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct
right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Offered
Notes. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, may not be adequate to
ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Offered Notes.

**_Prepayment of the Class B7 Loan may negatively affect the projected yield to maturity of the Offered Notes._**

The yield to maturity of the Offered Notes will depend on, amongst other things, the amount and timing of
repayment and prepayment of principal on the Class B7 Loan and the price paid by the holders of the Offered Notes.
Such yield may be adversely affected by a higher or lower than anticipated rate of prepayment on the Class B7 Loan.
The rate of prepayment of the Class B7 Loan cannot be predicted and will be influenced by a wide variety of economic
and other factors, including prevailing interest rates, the buoyancy of the UK holiday centre market, the availability

-----

of alternative financing and local and regional economic conditions. Therefore, no assurance can be given as to the
level of prepayment that will be experienced. In addition, Topco will be required to immediately repay all of the Class
B Loans (including the Class B7 Loan) in the event that (1) any Class B Loan remains outstanding at the close of
business on the Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date for such Class B Loan or (2) Topco receives a valid demand
notice from the Borrower Security Trustee following the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event and/or a Class B
Loan Event of Default. The Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date and the Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date
each occur prior to the Class B7 Loan Expected Maturity Date and therefore failure by the Borrowers to repay the
Class B5 Loan or the Class B6 Loan on or prior to such dates may result in enforcement of the Topco Payment
Undertaking and the Topco Security Documents which in turn may result in the Class B7 Loan being repaid prior to
the Class B7 Loan Expected Maturity Date.

**_Changes of law may have a negative impact on the ability of the Issuer to meet its payment obligations under the_**
**_Offered Notes._**

The transactions described in this Offering Memorandum (including the issuance of the Offered Notes) and
the ratings assigned to the Offered Notes are based on the relevant law and administrative practice in effect as at the
date hereof, and having regard to the expected tax treatment of all relevant entities under such law and practice. It is
possible that, whether as a result of case law or through statute, changes in law or regulations, or their interpretation
or application, or administrative practice or tax treatment after the date of this Offering Memorandum, may result in
either the Issuer’s, Center Parcs’ or the Obligor Group’s debt financing arrangements as originally structured no longer
having the effect anticipated or which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s, Center Parcs’ or the Obligor
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations and/or could adversely affect the rights, priorities of
payments and/or treatment of holdings in Class B7 Notes of the holders of the Offered Notes.

**_The Offered Notes will be subject to restrictions on transfer, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price_**
**_at which they may be sold._**

The Offered Notes have not been, nor will they be, registered under the securities laws of the United States
or elsewhere. The Offered Notes may not be publicly offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred in any jurisdiction
where registration may be required. In particular, sales and transfers of the Offered Notes are subject to restrictions
and/or certification requirements under the Securities Act as set forth in more detail under “Notice to Investors and
_Transfer Restrictions.” These restrictions may limit your ability to resell the Offered Notes. You should inform_
yourself of, and seek legal advice in relation to, applicable securities laws.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The estimated gross proceeds from the issuance of the Offered Notes will be £330,000,000.

Subject to the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer intends to make available to
CPH3 on the Ninth Closing Date the Class B7 Facility and the Class B7 Loan will be advanced under the Class B7
Facility.

On the Ninth Closing Date, the proceeds from the issuance of the Class B7 Notes will be used by the Issuer
to make the Class B7 Loan available to CPH3 under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. CPH3 will use
£250,000,000 of the proceeds of the Class B7 Loan to fund the Subscriptions to enable each Class B4 Borrower to
repay to the Issuer its corresponding portion of the principal amount outstanding under the Class B4 Loan so as to
enable a redemption by the Issuer of a corresponding portion of the Class B4 Notes (but not including the payment of
accrued and unpaid interest). The remaining £80,000,000 of the proceeds of the Class B7 Loan will be applied towards
funding a distribution to shareholders and paying fees, costs and expenses in connection with the Transactions.

On or about the Ninth Closing Date, the Issuer will redeem the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
£250,000,000 of the Class B4 Notes at a redemption price of 100.000% of the principal amount of such Class B4
Notes redeemed, which is the redemption price applicable to the Class B4 Notes on or after 28 August 2022. Proceeds
of the Class B7 Loan in the amount of £250,000,000 will be used to prepay a corresponding portion of the principal
amount of the Class B4 Loan (but not including any accrued and unpaid interest) so as to enable a redemption by the
Issuer of a corresponding portion of the Class B4 Notes. The payment of the accrued and unpaid interest up to the date
of prepayment will be funded from other funds available to the Third Initial Borrowers. The Issuer will apply the
proceeds of such prepayment to redeem the Class B4 Notes in full on or about the Ninth Closing Date. The following
table describes the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Transactions as at the Ninth Closing
Date. The actual amounts as compared with those set forth in the table and in the accompanying footnotes are subject
to adjustments and may differ at the date of completion of the Transactions depending on several factors, including
differences from the estimation of fees and expenses.

prepayment fees or other charges expected to be owed under such facilities. The amount shown for the Class A4 Facility includes £7.9
million of issue premium.

(3) Unamortised deferred issue costs represent unamortised financing transaction costs to be recognised in the income statement over the
remaining period of the borrowing using the effective interest method. The increase in unamortised deferred issue costs of £6.4 million
represents the estimated fees and expenses of £7 million associated with the Transactions minus write-off of unamortised deferred issue
costs of £0.6 million as at 28 December 2023 related to the Class B4 Facility.

(4) On the Second Issue Date, the Issuer entered into the Liquidity Facility Agreement in order to enable the Issuer to service interest due
on the Class A Notes in the event of insufficient funds being received from the Obligors under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement to ensure that the Issuer meets its interest payments due to the Class A Noteholders. As at 28 December 2023, the total
commitments under the Liquidity Facility were £110.0 million. The Liquidity Facility is expected to be undrawn as at the Ninth Closing
Date. Total third party debt does not include lease liabilities of £41.4 million as of 28 December 2023.

(5) The decrease in total equity reflects the write-off of £0.6 million (as at 28 December 2023) of unamortised deferred issue costs related
to the Class B4 Facility, in connection with the Transactions.

(6) Total capitalisation is defined as the sum of total third party debt and total equity.

_conditions to differ materially from those expressed or implied herein. For a discussion of some of those risks and_
_uncertainties, see the sections entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors”._

**Overview**

Center Parcs is a leading UK short-break holiday business, attracting 2.1 million guests in the financial year
ended 20 April 2023. Center Parcs operates five specially constructed holiday villages in the UK: Sherwood Forest in
Nottinghamshire, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Elveden Forest in Suffolk, Whinfell Forest in Cumbria (the “Original
**Villages”) and Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire. Each village is set in a forest environment amongst approximately 400**
acres of forest around a lake and is typically open 365 days per year.

Woodland, water and a natural environment make up the essential elements of a Center Parcs break. Within
this comfortable, quiet, car-free and family-friendly setting, each of the Center Parcs villages provides guests with
high-quality accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. In total, as of 28 December 2023, there
were 4,334 units of accommodation across its five villages, which could accommodate approximately 22,946 guests
per day at 100% occupancy. The focal point and key attraction of each village is an all-weather indoor sub-tropical
swimming paradise, featuring a selection of water activities including a wave pool, river slides and rides, children’s
pools and Jacuzzis. Center Parcs’ on-site experiences also include outdoor activities such as cycling, boating and zip
wires; indoor activities such as ten-pin bowling, badminton and pottery; and amenities such as spas, food and beverage
and retail. A significant proportion of Center Parcs’ revenue is generated from guests’ on-site spending, including for
leisure and spa activities, food and beverage and retail, representing 38.3% of total revenue in the financial year ended
20 April 2023 and 39.4% in the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023.

Center Parcs has a well-established brand in the UK, renowned for providing high-quality experiences and
facilities, targeting a primary guest base of affluent families. Center Parcs benefits from strong guest loyalty with
approximately 31.7% of guests returning within a 14-month period of their initial visit and approximately 54.1% of
guests returning within a five-year period as of financial year 2023. Furthermore, in the financial year ended 20 April
2023, 95% of guests indicated an intention to return in the future. Center Parcs believes that its business model is
difficult to replicate due to the lack of suitable locations for the development of holiday parks and high development
costs while Center Parcs is well positioned to continue to grow its business.

Center Parcs’ villages typically draw on a regional population of guests who are attracted to the convenience
of being within a relatively short driving distance from home. Over 80% of the UK population lives within a 2.5-hour
drive of at least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two-hour drive of
the village they choose to visit. Center Parcs believes that the proximity of the majority of guests to its villages
combined with the easy accessibility of the villages by car make Center Parcs a popular and convenient short break
holiday option. Occupancy levels at Center Parcs’ villages have recovered to their pre-COVID-19 levels. As a result
of village closures and occupancy restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, occupancy levels fell to 22.4%
in financial year 2021. Occupancy levels rose to 80.5% in financial year 2022, with self-imposed capacity restrictions
in place, and further to 97.1% in the financial year 2023, broadly in line with pre-COVID-19 occupancy rates. In the
36-week period ended 28 December 2023 occupancy levels were 97.1% (97.3% for the 36-week period ended 29
December 2022). Occupancy levels have averaged approximately 97.0% in the last 15 years and approximately 97.4%
in the last eight years, in each case excluding financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022 (which were impacted by COVID19 closures and self-imposed capacity restrictions).

In each of the financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, revenue and EBITDA have been broadly
evenly split amongst Center Parcs’ villages, reflecting both the individual strength of each village and the diversity of
Center Parcs’ asset base.

The map below shows the location of each of Center Parcs’ villages in the UK as of 18 April 2024.

With the exception of the financial years impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, revenue and EBITDA have
consistently grown over the past fifteen years. Total revenue and EBITDA were £593.8 million and £275.0 million,
respectively, for financial year 2023, which marks an increase compared to £503.4 million and £245.6 million,
respectively, in financial year 2022. For the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023, Center Parcs had revenue of
£439.3 million and EBITDA of £208.7 million, representing an EBITDA margin of 47.5%.

to 13 July 2020, 5 November 2020 to 4 December 2020 and 21 December 2020 to 12 April 2021, during which Center Parcs recorded
no revenues, as well as localised closures as a result of the tier restrictions in later periods.

(2) Primarily due to self-imposed restrictions, Center Parcs’ villages operated at 80.5% capacity during financial year 2022 which affected
revenues from accommodation and on-site sales.

**Key Factors affecting Results of Operations**

**Economic conditions in the United Kingdom**

Although economic uncertainty has impacted the UK holiday market in the periods under review, Center
Parcs has historically performed resiliently during both economic downturns (including the 2007-2008 global financial
crisis) and recoveries, with occupancy levels averaging approximately 97.0% in the last 15 years and approximately
97.4% in the last eight years, in each case excluding financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022 (which were impacted by
COVID-19 closures and self-imposed capacity restrictions). Demand for Center Parcs’ products and services is
sensitive to disposable income levels and preferences regarding holiday length and destination, which are linked to
general economic conditions in the UK. Higher energy prices and supply disruptions, including as a result of Russia’s
war in Ukraine, have resulted in high inflation, including in the UK. While the annual CPIH inflation rate in the UK
decreased from 9.2% for the twelve months ended December 2022, to 4.2% for the twelve months ended December
2023, it remains above recent historical levels. In response to the high inflation rates, central banks in major
economies, including the Bank of England, increased interest rates in 2022 and 2023. Even if inflation rates were to
fall gradually in 2024, there would still be a possibility of further interest rate increases in 2024 and beyond or that
interest rates remain higher than recent historical rates. Increases in both energy costs and personnel costs, driven by
general inflationary pressures and, with respect to personnel costs, an increase in the national living wage, have
resulted in higher operating costs for Center Parcs.

Weak economic conditions, whether as a result of the current cost of living crisis, high energy prices or
otherwise, may result in a decline in the number of guests and a decrease in on-site spending. However, such economic
conditions in the United Kingdom or a weaker exchange rate of the pound sterling against currencies such as the euro

84


-----

and US dollar may result in more British families opting to take domestic holidays in the United Kingdom, instead of
traveling overseas, which could result in Center Parcs’ villages being more attractive to such families.

**The COVID-19 pandemic**

The COVID-19 pandemic, and related government measures, had a significant impact on the travel and
hospitality industry in the United Kingdom, including Center Parcs. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Center
Parcs closed all of its villages to guests from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020, 5 November 2020 to 4 December 2020
and 21 December 2020 to 11 April 2021. The closure of the villages resulted in no revenue being recorded from
holidays that would have taken place during that period, which in financial year 2021 included periods such as May
half-term, the Christmas/New Year periods and the Easter holidays, each of which have historically been very
profitable. In the periods of 2020 and 2021 during which the villages were open to guests, they operated with limited
capacity and were also subject to localised closures as a result of the tier restrictions, such as the closure of Sherwood
Village from 30 October 2020 and the closure of Woburn Village from 18 December 2020, in both cases until the 12
April 2021 reopening. Despite the reopening of the villages by 12 April 2021, Center Parcs’ villages operated under
self-imposed restrictions and capacity limitations to reduce the risk of localised outbreaks for much of financial year
2022.

During the closure of Center Parcs’ villages, Center Parcs ensured stringent cost controls and implemented
strict cash management procedures to conserve liquidity, including the rephasing of capital investment projects and
cessation of non-essential operating activities. Center Parcs estimates that approximately 37.5% of its total capital
expenditure originally planned for financial year 2021 was allocated to later periods. In addition, Center Parcs also
participated in a number of UK government support measures for businesses to reduce the impact of the closures on
its liquidity. Center Parcs deferred VAT payments and furloughed up to 90% of its employees during the Closure
Periods in accordance with the UK government’s CJRS scheme. Center Parcs also utilised the 12-month business rates
holiday available to retail, hospitality and leisure businesses. Together, these actions reduced operating expenses by
approximately £14 million on average per four-week period, or approximately 70%, to approximately £6 to £7 million
on average per four-week period from 24 April 2020 to 18 June 2020 and 21 December 2020 to 25 February 2021,
representing a closed period, as compared to approximately £20 million on average per four-week period from 26
April 2019 to 27 February 2020, representing a typical operating period. Operating expenses gradually increased in
the lead up to the re-opening of the villages on 12 April 2021.

The aftermath of COVID-19 has increased demand for travel in the UK. As reported by Mintel, plans to book
a domestic holiday in the UK reached an all-time high in January 2024. This increased demand for holidays in the UK
positively affects occupancy and ADR and drives profitability.

**Seasonality**

Center Parcs’ operations are subject to seasonal factors, as pricing varies significantly depending on the time
of year. Center Parcs’ prices are highest during peak demand periods, which include the main holiday periods at
Easter, the summer holidays and the Christmas/New Year period, along with school half terms. Center Parcs’ revenues
and operating costs are therefore also typically highest during such peak demand periods. Occupancy rates, however,
remain relatively unchanged throughout the year, as Center Parcs’ online dynamic pricing encourages demand outside
of the peak periods. Ahead of the peak demand periods, the peak booking season occurs in late December to late
February, and Center Parcs plans a significant concentration of its marketing campaigns around this time. For financial
year 2021, given the closure of Center Parcs’ villages at its traditional peak marketing period, expenditure on
marketing campaigns was deferred.

**Revenue and other key performance indicators**

**_Revenue_**

Center Parcs’ revenue is principally comprised of accommodation revenue generated from holidays at Center
Parcs’ accommodation, and on-site revenue, comprised of amounts received predominantly from the sale of food and
beverages, retail items, leisure activities and spa-related activities. The combined total of accommodation and on-site
revenue is a key indicator of the overall performance of the business. Accommodation revenue is recognised on a
straight-line basis over the period of the holiday, and on-site revenue is recognised at the point the guest undertakes
the relevant activity or receives the relevant service.

Revenue for financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023 was £122.2 million, £503.4 million and £593.8 million,
respectively. Revenue for the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023 was £439.3 million as compared to

85


-----

£426.6 million for the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022. The proportional contribution of individual villages
to revenue for the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023 remained broadly the same as the corresponding
contribution in the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022.

Advance payments for accommodation and pre-booked activities are recorded as payments on account within
trade and other payables until the holiday commences. Revenues are primarily driven by occupancy levels and pricing.

**_Occupancy_**

Center Parcs measures occupancy as the average number of units of accommodation occupied as a percentage
of the total number of units of accommodation available, including those units that are off-line for refurbishment.

Occupancy is a key driver of both accommodation and on-site revenue. Higher levels of occupancy generally
result in greater volumes of on-site purchases, reflecting the increased number of guests. Center Parcs’ business is
generally characterised by high occupancy rates, and achieved occupancy rates of 22.4%, 80.5% and 97.1% in the
financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The lower occupancy level for financial year 2021 reflects the
impact of government-imposed COVID-19 restrictions while the occupancy for financial year 2022 reflects largely
self-imposed capacity restrictions in place. For the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023, Center Parcs had an
occupancy rate of 97.1%, reflecting a strong recovery from COVID-19 closures and subsequent capacity restrictions.

**_Average Daily Rate_**

One of the key performance indicators Center Parcs uses to help measure and maximise its yield is ADR
which is calculated as the average rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total accommodation income for the period
divided by the total number of accommodation nights sold. Due to yield management adjustments, ADR can vary
substantially between low and peak periods. See “— Seasonality”.

ADR for the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023 was £251.01, compared with £252.14 for the 36-week
period ended 29 December 2022. ADR for the financial year 2023 was £239.28, compared with £256.09 and £238.70
for financial years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Improvements in ADR have primarily reflected inflationary price increases, improved mix of
accommodation following refurbishment upgrades and new build projects (resulting in an increased amount of higher
quality accommodation) as well as yield management improvements. From financial year 2012 through financial year
2020, ADR grew at a CAGR of 4.3%, in part due to refurbishments and a slightly higher proportion of premium
executive accommodation, as well as the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014. ADR for the 36-week periods ended 29
December 2022 and 28 December 2023 was broadly stable. The higher ADR for financial year 2022 reflects certain
lower-yielding accommodation units being taken off sale as part of the Group’s ongoing management of restricted
capacity.

**_RevPAL_**

RevPAL is the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on the total accommodation income
divided by the total available number of accommodation nights. RevPAL can also be calculated as ADR multiplied
by occupancy.

RevPAL for the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023 was £243.83, compared with £245.41 for the 36week period ended 29 December 2022. RevPAL for the financial year 2023 was £232.39, compared with £206.23.
and £53.45 for financial years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The scale of the increases in RevPAL over the years primarily reflects those factors discussed for ADR above.
Center Parcs’ management believes RevPAL to be a meaningful indicator of performance as RevPAL takes into
account both occupancy and ADR.

**_EBITDA_**

EBITDA for the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023 was £208.7 million, compared with £213.6 million

**_Yield Management and Pricing_**

Center Parcs applies “yield management” strategies to maximise revenue levels throughout the year. It
actively adjusts its pricing throughout the 104 available three and four day “breaks” in each year to reflect the seasonal

86


-----

and other fluctuations in demand. Center Parcs uses ADR and RevPAL to measure its yield management. It has a
dedicated pricing team that monitors advance bookings and adjusts prices for accommodation during the year
according to expected guest demand. The yield management strategies have helped Center Parcs achieve consistently
high occupancy rates.

Unlike accommodation prices, on-site prices generally fluctuate less throughout the year and are less seasonal
as these prices have not been subject to similar levels of pricing and yield management as accommodation prices. Onsite prices are also reviewed regularly and increased to reflect inflation.

**_Advance bookings_**

Center Parcs places a strong emphasis on advance bookings, which results in significant revenue and cash
flow visibility. Advance bookings measure the percentage of accommodation available during a financial year that
have been booked at the beginning of that financial year. Prior to the Closure Periods due to COVID-19, the average
of booking-to-arrival time in financial years 2018 to 2020 was 19 weeks. After the Closure Periods due to COVID19, the average of booking-to-arrival time in financial year 2023 was 22 weeks.

Center Parcs holidays are available for booking starting from either 15 months or 18 months in advance of
the scheduled stay date, depending on when in the year the booking is made. Center Parcs collects 30% of the
accommodation cost at the time of booking if the booking is made more than ten weeks in advance of the holiday,
with the balance of the cost collected ten weeks prior to the start of the break that has been booked. If a guest books
less than ten weeks prior to the arrival date, the accommodation cost is payable in full on booking and cannot be
refunded upon cancellation. Leisure activities available at the villages can be pre-booked and pre-paid prior to arrival.
Guests can only pre-book leisure activities if they pre-pay.

For the financial year 2023, approximately 49% of the available accommodation nights had been booked by
the beginning of that financial year. In financial year 2023, more than 60% of on-site Leisure activities were prebooked and pre-paid prior to arrival.

**_Cost of sales and overheads_**

Center Parcs’ principal operating costs are cost of sales, village overheads and central overheads. In addition,
Center Parcs benefits from having a flexible cost base, as demonstrated by its ability to manage its operating expenses
during the COVID-19 Closure Periods. For the purposes of its audited consolidated financial statements, village
overheads and central overheads are treated as ‘administrative expenses’. The following table sets forth total cost of
sales and overheads for the periods indicated:

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales represents variable direct expenses incurred from revenue-generating activities, primarily
expenses of food and beverages and retail merchandise and associated payroll costs. These costs generally vary with
changes in revenue, as well as inflation and commodity prices. Center Parcs continually evaluates and renegotiates
supply agreements centrally and aims to apply best practices, such as improving the supplier tender process, taking
advantage of promotional offers and re-negotiating key costs in a timely manner, throughout the group.

Center Parcs utilises visibility of forward bookings to optimise the efficiency of personnel across the village
by matching staffing levels to expected demand in various areas of its business.

**_Village Overheads_**

The primary components of village overheads are set forth in the table below:

**52 weeks ended** **52 weeks ended** **52 weeks ended** **36 weeks ended** **36 weeks ended**
**22 April** **21 April** **20 April** **29 December** **28 December**

**Total**

The largest cost within village overheads is in respect of personnel costs, which are subject to annual pay
increases as well as to increases arising from legislative and regulatory changes, The UK government introduced a
national living wage in the 2015 budget, which has applied to employees aged 25 and over starting in April 2016, and
includes further phased increases in April of every year. Center Parcs extended a similar wage increase to employees
under the age of 25 as well. On 1 April 2021, the national living wage was applied to employees aged 23 and over
and, on 1 April 2024, the national living wage was applied to employees aged 21 and over. As of 1 April 2024, the
national living wage increased from £10.42 per hour to £11.44 per hour. Personnel costs increased in the 36-week
period ended 28 December 2023 as compared to the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022, primarily as a result
of the increase in the national living wage. The continued increases in energy costs from financial year 2021 to
financial year 2023 were primarily a result of worldwide energy prices increasing following the Russian invasion of
Ukraine.

Center Parcs seeks to manage other village overheads through actively managing costs by benchmarking
each of its villages against each other in order to strive to achieve “best in class”.

**_Central Overheads_**

The primary components of central overheads are set forth in the table below:

Marketing costs are primarily incurred in connection with marketing and advertising campaigns through all
media channels. Center Parcs seeks to manage the cost of its marketing campaigns through the use of cost-efficient
marketing channels such as internet advertising and targeted emails to contacts in its guest database. Marketing
campaigns are planned annually with a significant concentration around the peak booking season of late December to
late February. During the closure of Center Parcs’ villages due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs significantly
reduced its marketing expenditure. Center Parcs has since re-commenced its marketing activities. Personnel costs
within Central Overheads relates to Head Office employees as opposed to those employed at the villages.

Other costs relates to all other central costs and includes, among other things, credit card charges and IT
costs, less rebates received by Center Parcs from its suppliers.

and fittings and motor vehicles and hardware, and amortisation of software and other intangible assets. Depreciation
and amortisation for the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023 was £45.8 million compared with £45.5 million
for the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022. Depreciation and amortisation for financial year 2023 was
£64.0 million, compared with £62.4 million and £62.5 million for financial years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

-----

Occupancy decreased slightly from 97.3% in the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022 to 97.1% during
the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023. This is comparable to levels seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

ADR decreased slightly by 0.4% to £251.01 in the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023 compared to
the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022, primarily due to changes in booking trends seen post COVID-19 as a
result of disruptions and closures. This decrease in ADR together with the slightly lower occupancy resulted in
RevPAL of £243.83 (36-week period ended 29 December 2022: £245.41) in the 36-week period ended 28 December
2023.

period ended 28 December 2023 as compared to the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022. The slightly lower
EBITDA is partly as a result of unusual bookings patterns in the 36 weeks ended 29 December 2022, following
reopening after the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Depreciation and amortisation_**

Depreciation and amortisation for the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023 was broadly stable at

million in the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022. The increase of £5.8 million in finance expense was due to
the incurrence of additional Class A indebtedness in April 2023.

Finance income represents bank interest receivable and amounted to £2.3 million for the 36-week period
ended 28 December 2023 as compared to £0.9 million for the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022.

As a result of the factors described above, profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders decreased
by £9.6 million in the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023 as compared to the 36-week period ended 29

£593.8 million, compared to £503.4 million in the financial year ended 21 April 2022. This increase was primarily a
result of increased occupancy following the lifting of COVID-19 capacity restrictions in the financial year ended 21

ADR decreased by 6.6% to £239.28 in the financial year ended 20 April 2023 compared to the financial year
ended 21 April 2022, primarily due to one-off events such as capacity restrictions in the prior year when lower yielding
accommodation was taken off sale. ADR remained strong in comparison to the years prior to COVID-19 restrictions.

93


-----

of Center Parcs’ inventories, trade and other receivables and current trade and other payables (excluding taxation
creditors and capital and interest accruals).

As occupancy rates have returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, operating expenses and capital expenditures have
increased as well. These have been offset through increases in cash from operating activities and financing.

Center Parcs further augmented its liquidity position through an interest-free working capital facility of £70
million in the financial year ended 22 April 2021, which was fully repaid in the following financial year. Cash and
cash equivalents as at 21 March 2024 was £45.9 million.

Center Parcs may, from time to time, seek other sources of funding, which may include debt or equity
financings depending on its financing needs and market conditions.

Net cash from operating activities was £150.9 million and £160.2 million in the 36-week period ended 28
December 2023 and the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022, respectively. The primary reason for the decrease
of £9.3 million, or 5.8%, in cash flows from operating activities for the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023 as
compared with the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022 was primarily due to one-off payments in respect of
prior years.

Net cash from operating activities was £33.9 million, £276.6 million and £273.4 million in financial years
2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The primary reason for the increase of £242.7 million in cash flows from operating
activities for financial year 2022 as compared with financial year 2021 was the lifting of restrictions and the reopening
of villages following the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove increased revenue. The primary reason for the decrease
in net cash from operating activities of £3.2 million, or 1.2%, for financial year 2023 as compared with financial year

-----

2022 was due to cash flows in financial year 2022 following the reopening of villages after COVID-19 and forward
bookings being re-established.

Net cash used in investing activities was £54.7 million and £42.3 million in the 36-week period ended 28
December 2023 and the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities
was £39.0 million, £46.1 million and £63.5 million in financial year 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used
in investing activities in all financial years predominantly relates to the purchase of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets.

Net cash from financing activities was £579.1 million and £175.2 million in the 36-week period ended 28
December 2023 and the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities
in the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023 predominantly related to the payment of interest, dividends and loan
note repayments. Net cash used in financing activities in the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022 predominantly
related to the payment of interest and dividends.

Net cash from/(used) in financing activities was £62.7 million, £(171.5) million and £151.9 million in
financial year 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Net cash from/(used) in financing activities in financial year 2021
predominantly related to the payment of interest and dividends, off-set by the net proceeds of equity contributions and
a refinancing of Center Parcs’ secured debt. Net cash used in financing activities in financial year 2022 predominantly
related to the payment of interest and dividends, partially off-set by the net proceeds of a refinancing of Center Parcs’
secured debt. Net cash from financing activities in financial year 2023 predominantly related to the payment of interest
and dividends, off-set by the refinancing of Center Parcs’ secured debt.

Center Parcs defines capital expenditure as additions to property, plant and equipment and other intangible
assets. Center Parcs defines maintenance capital expenditure as the capital expenditure required on the central
buildings, infrastructure and facilities to maintain the ongoing standards of these areas. Center Parcs defines
investment capital expenditure as where it expects to generate a return on capital. Investment capital expenditure
includes capital expenditure incurred in respect of the development of villages, amenities and facilities, including
building new accommodation; upgrading existing accommodation and upgrading, adding or extending restaurants,
retail outlets and other facilities.

Capital investments are organised and planned annually around significant, regular planned maintenance and
capital expenditure that is intended to maintain high occupancy levels and drive revenue growth through improved
appeal of accommodation units, facilities and amenities.

The capital refurbishment programme of Center Parcs’ accommodation units can be broken into two distinct
investment cycles within a 16- to 20-year period:

      - _Refurbishment: approximately every eight to ten years, each unit needs to be refurbished to maintain_
Center Parcs’ targeted standards, which typically ensures existing levels of ADR are maintained;
and

      - _Upgrade: following the refurbishment cycle there is typically a further eight to ten years before a_
unit is upgraded, which includes a full refurbishment of the unit and also an upgrade of the standard
to add new features and to modernise the style of the unit.

Although investment capital expenditure increases during the investment phase of a refurbishment or upgrade
programme, profit margins and operating profit generally increase in the years following completion of the investment
programmes as guests demand higher-end or upgraded accommodation.

95


-----

The covenants under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement require the Obligors to spend a minimum
of £18.5 million per year in relation to maintenance capital expenditure and an average of £6.0 million per annum
over a four-year period on investment capital expenditure. During the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023, total
capital expenditure was £49.5 million, of which £27.7 million was spent on maintenance capital expenditure and £21.8
million on investment capital expenditure, as compared to total capital expenditure of £38.9 million during the 36week period ended 29 December 2022, of which £23.4 million was spent on maintenance capital expenditure and
£21.8 million on investment capital expenditure. Total capital expenditure was £41.8 million, £48.0 million and
£70.1 million for financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Center Parcs spent £43.0 million on maintenance
capital expenditure and £27.1 million on investment capital expenditure in financial year 2023, of which investment
capital expenditure of £12.8 million related to accommodation upgrades, £4.4 million related to pool complex
upgrades and £9.9 million related to other investment projects such as food and beverage, retail and leisure activity
offerings. Center Parcs spent £26.4 million on maintenance capital expenditure and £21.6 million on investment
capital expenditure in financial year 2022, of which investment capital expenditure of £13.3 million related to
accommodation upgrades, £3.4 million related to pool complex upgrades and £4.9 million related to other investment
projects such as food and beverage, retail and leisure activity offerings. Historically, changes in capital expenditure
have been driven primarily by varying levels of investment capital expenditure (including accommodation upgrades)
with underlying maintenance capital expenditure remaining relatively stable. Center Parcs continued its upgrade
programme and 3,244 units of accommodation were upgraded as at 28 December 2023, driving continued growth in
ADR.

**Working capital**

Center Parcs has historically had negative working capital requirements largely arising from the payment by
guests for their short breaks in advance of arrival. The closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic saw a large
proportion of these advance payments refunded to guests, causing a working capital outflow. Following the re-opening
of Center Parcs’ villages, working capital requirements returned to their pre-COVID-19 levels.

Center Parcs’ trade receivables are primarily composed of corporate sales made through its Corporate Events
division, and inventories are primarily composed of stock in Center Parcs retail and food and beverage outlets. Center
Parcs’ trade and other payables primarily relate to advance accommodation income received from guests, trade
creditors, accrued expenditure, VAT and payroll taxes due and other current liabilities.

Center Parcs has historically funded working capital requirements through cash generated from operations.
There is a degree of seasonality in the working capital requirements linked to accommodation revenue receipts.

Payments held on account have historically been at their lowest level after the Christmas period and prior to
the key booking period of late December to late February and at the end of each calendar year. This contrasts with the
significantly higher payments held on account typically seen in April or in advance of the summer holiday season.
With the enforced closures of the villages and uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, this key booking
period was adversely affected in 2021. However, booking activity has since returned to normal levels.

Depending upon its rate of growth and profitability, including as a result of travel and operating restrictions,
Center Parcs may require additional equity or debt financing to meet working capital requirements or capital
expenditure needs. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if needed, will be available when required or,
if available, on terms satisfactory to Center Parcs.

**Contractual commitments**

As at 20 April 2023, Center Parcs had capital expenditure contracted for but not provided of £17.6 million.
The related projects have since been completed or are currently ongoing. Center Parcs has no other material contractual
commitments with the exception of the headleases on the Longleat and Woburn properties. The Group has no material
contingent liabilities or assets at 20 April 2023.

**Off-balance sheet arrangements and contingent liabilities**

Center Parcs has no off-balance sheet arrangements or contingent liabilities.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market and Credit risks**

**_Market risks_**

_General economic conditions_

The disposable income of Center Parcs’ guests and/or their holiday preferences are and will be affected by
changes in the general economic environment and this may result in a fall in the number of guests and/or a decrease
in on-site expenditure. Center Parcs regularly reviews its product offering and engages with guests to ensure it provides
value for money to meet guest needs.

_Brexit_

On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom formally left the European Union and entered the Brexit Transition
Period, which expired on 31 December 2020. On 31 December 2020, the UK implemented the EU—UK Trade and
Cooperation Agreement on future relations between the EU and the UK, which entered into force provisionally on 1
January 2021. There remains significant uncertainty as to how the Brexit will affect relations between the UK and the
EU, including the legal rights and obligations for businesses in certain services industries not covered by the EU—
UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. Thus far, the formal exit has not had a material impact on the business of
Center Parcs. However, Center Parcs will continue to monitor political and economic developments and has plans in
place for all eventualities.

_Competition_

The Center Parcs brand is synonymous with high quality short breaks in a forest environment but Center
Parcs competes for the discretionary expenditure of potential guests, who could choose to take short breaks at other
destinations or participate in other recreational activities. Center Parcs believes that this risk is mitigated by the
strength of the Center Parcs brand and the continual investment in the accommodation and central facilities (including
retail and restaurants), coupled with the innovation amongst the leisure activities and the responsiveness to guest
surveys.

_Seasonality and weather_

Demand for short breaks is influenced by the main holiday periods at Easter, the summer holidays and the
Christmas/New Year period. This risk is mitigated by online dynamic pricing which encourages demand outside of
the peak periods. The accommodation is located within forest environments and a significant number of activities take
place outdoors. Therefore, demand may be impacted by the prevailing weather. This risk is minimal because guests
tend not to book on impulse and the vast majority of breaks and activities are booked in advance. Additionally, Center
Parcs maintains diversity between its indoor and outdoor activities to mitigate this risk.

**_Financial risks_**

The Directors and senior managers regularly review the financial requirements of Center Parcs and the
associated risks. Center Parcs does not use complicated financial instruments and where financial instruments are
used, they are used to reduce interest rate risk. Center Parcs does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes.
Center Parcs finances its operations through a mixture of retained earnings and borrowings as required. Historically,
Center Parcs has sought to reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring its funding using the underlying
asset value.

_Interest rate risk_

As at 20 April 2023 and 21 April 2022, the Group had fixed rate loan notes as its only external funding
source.

_Liquidity risk_

As at 20 April 2023, the Group held sufficient levels of cash and committed funding to enable it to meet its
medium-term working capital, lease liability and funding obligations. Rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity
requirements are prepared and monitored, and surplus cash is invested in interest bearing accounts.

97


-----

_Currency risk_

The Group is exposed to limited currency risk through foreign currency transactions. The Group does not
operate a hedging facility to manage currency risk as this risk is considered to be insignificant.

_Credit risk_

The Group borrows from well-established institutions with high credit ratings. The Group’s cash balances
are held on deposit with a number of UK banking institutions.

_Financial reporting risk_

The Group’s financial systems are required to process a large number of transactions securely and accurately;
any weaknesses in the systems could result in the incorrect reporting of financial results and covenant compliance.

_Accounting policies_

The following accounting policies are considered to be pertinent to this review of Center Parcs’ operating
and financial results. See Note 1 to the 2023 Audited Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

_Revenue recognition_

Revenue relates to accommodation rental income on holidays commenced during the period, together with
other related income that primarily arises from on-village leisure, retail and food and beverage spend. Revenue relating
to accommodation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the holiday. The performance obligation
for non-rental income, and hence the basis for revenue recognition, is when the related product or service is provided
to the guest. All revenue is recorded net of VAT.

Payment for accommodation rental income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded
as ‘deferred income’ within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences. As such no revenue was
recognised during the period the villages were closed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A number of trading units on each holiday village are operated by concession partners. Revenue due in
respect of such units is recognised on an accruals basis.

All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.

_Property, plant and equipment_

Center Parcs carries property, plant and equipment at cost rather than current valuation. As such, no increases
in the value of Center Parcs’ property, plant and equipment are recognised in the financial statements. Any impairment
to the carrying value of these assets is recognised in the income statement.

_Maintenance expenditure_

It is the policy of Center Parcs to maintain its land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance
expenditure increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to generate, this expenditure is
capitalised. All other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

_Borrowings_

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest
method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement
of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

_Critical accounting policies_

_Discount rate used to determine the value of Center Parcs’ defined benefit pension scheme obligation_

Center Parcs’ defined benefit pension scheme obligation is discounted at a rate set by reference to market
yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Significant judgment is required when setting
the criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived.

98


-----

_Useful economic lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets_

Center Parcs reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets
at the end of each reporting period. During the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020, management has concluded that
no revision is required to either useful economic lives or residual values of these assets, and that residual values exceed
carrying values.

_Impairment test for goodwill_

Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating
units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires Center Parcs to estimate future cash
flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.

**Overview of the UK Holiday Market**

The UK holiday market is defined as the market for UK residents holidaying in the UK (domestic but
excluding Northern Ireland) and UK residents holidaying internationally (overseas).

Center Parcs operates in the UK holiday centres market, which consists of three segments: (a) traditional
holiday centres; (b) holiday parks centred around caravan or lodge accommodation; and (c) forest villages. These subsegments of the holiday market are described later on in this section.

**Economic Environment and Outlook**

**_Global Financial Crisis and Aftermath_**

Based on Mintel’s analysis, following the global financial crisis in 2008, the performance of the UK holiday
market was continuously impacted until 2014. Historical data shows that growth rates in domestic tourism tend to rise
and fall in relation to growth rates in the overseas holiday market. The last recession worked to the advantage of UK
tourism, in which Center Parcs is present, triggering a steep drop in holidays abroad and a “staycation effect” which
saw many consumers switching from overseas destinations to holidays closer to home.

As reported by Mintel, 39% of UK adults plan to take a holiday in the first three months of 2024, while in the
same period last year only 29% of adults were planning to do so. In addition, holiday preferences have remained similar
to previous years, with city breaks, family holiday and summer beach/countryside-based holidays, such as those offered
by Center Parcs, prevailing among preferred holiday types.

**_Decreasing Inflationary Pressures_**

In the last twelve months, inflation has decreased from 9.6% in January 2023 to 3.8% as of March 2024.
Despite interest rate hikes weighing on households due to mortgage and interest payments, as real incomes grow
alongside falling inflation, this has led to a regained confidence of UK households, evidenced by an increase in the
GfK Consumer Confidence Index from -45 in January 2023 to -24 in November 2023.

According to Mintel, booking levels in 2023 have increased in line with consumer confidence despite the
inflationary pressures, which have recently been declining. Consumers have remained relatively inelastic to rising
prices, hesitant to change or cancel holiday plans despite inflation. Pent-up demand for travel as a result of the COVID19 pandemic, built-up lockdown savings and consumers' desire to take once in a lifetime holidays have contributed to
positive booking figures, with 31% of people in the UK having booked a holiday in the period from October to
December 2023.

According to Mintel, while the value, i.e. the total spending on holidays, of UK domestic holidays, is
estimated to have fallen by 2% in 2023 as compared to 2022, it is still well above pre-COVID levels (17% higher than
domestic holidays value in 2019). Similarly, the volume, i.e. the total number of booked holidays, of UK domestic
holidays is estimated to have fallen by 5% in 2023 versus previous year, likely due to the higher inflation rates in the
beginning of 2023. Indeed, following a fall in trips at the beginning of the year, volumes improved throughout 2023,
highlighting a continued increase in domestic holidays as inflation falls.

According to VisitBritain’s Domestic Sentiment Tracker, in March 2024, 76% of respondents intend to take
an overnight domestic trip at least once over the next 12 months, while 57% intend to take an overseas trip. These
levels are above those anticipated in January 2023 when these figures were 70% and 52% respectively. In addition,
the number of respondents saying that they plan to cut the number of overnight trips, has remained stable compared
to one year ago, decreasing by 1% to 28%.

**_Outlook and Impact of COVID-19_**

While COVID-19 had a significant impact on holiday figures, particularly for overseas trips, the figures are

100


-----

now recovering. According to Mintel estimates, the total volume of British domestic holidays for 2024 is expected
to be 41.7 million trips, while overseas holidays is estimated to be 56.7 million trips for 2024. The recovery post
COVID-19 is expected to continue, with Mintel forecasting domestic holiday volumes to be 45.9 million trips in
2028 (a 12% increase from 2023 estimates) and 2028 overseas holidays to be 62.9 million trips.

**UK Holiday Centre Market Trends**

The longer-term key trends impacting the UK holiday centres market include the following:

**_Change in Guests: Socio-Economic Profile_**

According to Mintel, changes in socio-economic groups (“SEG”) and in particular the growth in the ABC1
category (“ABC1”) have historically benefited the holiday market and are likely to continue to do so in the medium
term. SEGs are based on the chief income earner and are defined as follows:

**SEG** **Occupation of Chief Income Earner**

A . . . . .  Higher managerial, administrative or professional

B . . . . .  Intermediate managerial, administrative or professional

C1 . . . . .  Supervisory or clerical and junior managerial, administrative or professional

C2 . . . . .  Skilled manual workers

D . . . . .  Semi-skilled and unskilled manual workers

E . . . . .  Unemployed

With high standards and expectations for their holidays, the ABC1 SEGs form the core target customer base
for Center Parcs. According to the latest available data from Mintel, the ABC1 segment as a whole represented 55%
of the UK population making it the largest segment of the UK population.

**_Changes in Demographics_**

According to the ONS, growth in demand for holiday centres in the UK is expected to be positively affected
by demographic changes, including the rise in the number of families with young children in particular. Based on
data released in January 2024, the number of children aged 10-14 in the UK is forecast to remain relatively stable in
the 2020-25 period, while the number of 15-19-year olds is forecast to increase by 7.9% over the same period.

Moreover, the ONS forecasts the number of adults aged 35-44 years to grow, increasing from 9.0 million
in 2020 to 9.6 million in 2025 (an increase of approximately 6.6%). This growth is expected to benefit the UK
holiday centre market as it increases the number of prime target guests, namely families with children, for holiday
centres over the short to medium term.

Mintel believes the government’s existing railcard discount scheme for 16 to 25-year-olds (offering a 33%
discount on train fares) which was extended to those aged between 26 and 30 in the spring of 2018, should incentivise
26 to 30-year-olds to visit more UK destinations for breaks.

**_Multiple Holiday Taking and Trend Towards Shorter Breaks_**

Prior to COVID-19, the trend towards shorter breaks remained steady with the UK short break market (1-3
nights) outperforming the UK domestic market as a whole. According to the Great Britain Tourism Survey
(“GBTS”), short breaks comprising between one to three nights accounted for almost two-thirds of the total UK
domestic tourism market over 2015 to 2018, and the volume of breaks of up to 7 days increased by 1.4% over the
same period. In 2019, 67% of domestic breaks in England, Wales and Scotland (“Great Britain”) were for a period
of 1-3 nights, an increase of 8.2% from 2018, with a further 29% being for 4-7 nights, as reported by the GBTS. In
the third quarter of 2023, according to the GBTS, 33% of domestic trips were spent visiting friends and families and
in 2023 (January to September), domestic breaks in Great Britain were for an average period of 3.0 nights.

**_Domestic Holiday Behaviour_**

According to Mintel, over half of domestic holiday makers say they are likely to choose staycations above
holidays abroad for climate-related reasons. Traditional domestic products like the British seaside holiday could
become more popular, as well as the possibility of new markets emerging. One in five UK holiday markets are “Deep
Green Domestics”, which prioritise environmentally-friendly factors when booking a holiday.

According to Mintel estimates, the volume of domestic holidays taken by British residents is expected to
have rebounded by 74.5% to 41.0 million in 2023 from 23.5 million in 2020 and is approximately near pre-Covid
levels.

Over the same period, domestic holiday expenditure is expected to have rebounded by 136.8% over the
same period to £13.8 billion. Mintel’s research indicates that 65% of the UK adult population took a domestic holiday
in the twelve months before October 2022, versus 37% who took a holiday overseas in the same period. Despite a
significant increase in average cost of a domestic holiday, people remain keen to explore new parts of the UK, with
many opting to stay in rental accommodation that has become more popular since the pandemic.

Average spend per domestic holiday increased for the third year in a row during 2023, and was 30% higher
in 2023 than in 2019. This is higher than the rate of CPI inflation over this period (22%). Pandemic restrictions on
overseas travel, as well as rising energy costs contributing to price increases, helped to draw in more higher-spending
affluent consumers to domestic tourism, during the period.

According to Mintel a “digital detox” trend is accelerating, where city dwellers seek to escape their
smartphones and computers. Thus, there is a growing need for holiday brands to encourage those in the 16 to 34year-old age bracket to disconnect and de-stress. Increased screen time as a result of COVID-19 emphasised the
value of breaking free of the virtual world, and therefore, Mintel suggests rural escapes that involve digital detox
activities and breaks are likely to appeal to more consumers than prior to COVID-19. Despite the strong rebound since
the pandemic, inflationary pressures and delayed rate cut expectations have elevated cost-of-living pressures and have
resulted in contradictory impacts on domestic tourism, with many consumers reducing the frequency of travel and
volume of holiday spend. Nonetheless, the UK domestic holiday market has a growing appeal to higher spending
consumers, highlighting strong demand potential for premium holiday cottages, wellness and luxury breaks.

**Market Segmentation and Product Offering**

The 'COVID-19 staycation' trend from 2020-21 has helped to reinforce the attraction of the UK domestic
market to younger families, many of whom are likely to have switched from overseas package holidays during this
period. According to Mintel, 59% of domestic holidays markets with children under 12 have taken more staycations
than trips abroad since COVID-19, while 53% of this family group has discovered a new UK destination as a result
of the pandemic. Two thirds of this group also prefer destinations less than 3 hours distance from home. Reducing
travel costs by holidaying nearer home is likely to continue to be popular as cost-of-living pressures remain in the
UK.

Leading overseas holiday brands are investing heavily in their own bespoke family resort brands. In the
domestic UK market, leading holiday centre brands such as Center Parcs, Butlins and Haven offer a similar
experience. Moreover, the focal point of Center Parcs’ villages is its Sub-tropical Swimming Paradise which, together
with Center Parcs’ premium product offering (accommodation, leisure activities, food and beverage, retail and Aqua
Sana spa), underpins the attractiveness of the Center Parcs’ concept for ABC1 guests.

While Center Parcs believes that it has a unique product offering, it is sometimes considered to be part of
the UK holiday centres market. The UK holiday centres market is divided into three distinct segments: (a) traditional
holiday centres; (b) holiday parks (large caravan/chalet parks offering an extensive range of holiday centre
facilities); and (c) forest villages (also considered as holiday centres but aimed more at rural quiet rather than
holiday bustle). These segments compete to a certain extent within the UK holiday centres market. However, while
traditional holiday centres and holiday parks tend to be coastal sites, dominated by guests mainly from the C1C2 socio-economic category, forest villages are based in woodland sites and attract mainly ABC1 families
looking for active forest village breaks and premium lodge park accommodation.

Forest Holidays (March 2022).

_Traditional holiday centres comprise the traditional brands such as Butlins, Warner and Pontins (a smaller_
UK operator), which were originally based on a 1950s “holiday camp” formula. They have evolved over time
(now fewer in numbers and individually larger in scale) and have invested significantly in recent years in
improving their accommodation and range of activities. These traditional centres are generally in beach locations
and therefore tend to primarily complement a family beach holiday. They are characterised by permanent
accommodation (rather than mobile homes) in blocks or detached buildings. Their offering may be full board or
self-catering, but generally includes free family-oriented entertainment, variety shows and leisure facilities, such
as swimming pools, amusement arcades, fairground-type rides and outdoor sports facilities, such as five-a-side
football, a climbing wall and crazy golf.

_Holiday parks_ constitute the largest sector within the UK holiday centres market, both by number of
locations and volume of holidays sold and comprise brands such as Parkdean Resorts, Haven and Hoseasons.
However, within the holiday park segment, it is difficult to distinguish between what are essentially larger caravan
parks with few facilities, and those parks with amenities and activities that are sophisticated enough to be
categorised as a traditional holiday centre. As consumer expectations increase, there is more demand for holiday
parks to provide a greater range of value- added services such as pools, restaurants, children’s clubs and
entertainment. Holiday parks cater to customers looking for three types of services: (a) hiring mobile homes or
fixed caravans; (b) purchasing these mobile homes; and (c) hiring space for towed caravans and tent campers.
Although they vary considerably in size, holiday parks are generally smaller in scale than the traditional holiday
centres. Holiday parks are often situated in coastal locations, often in scenic areas.

_Forest villages differ from traditional holiday centres and holiday parks which are part of the tradition of the_
British seaside holiday. Forest villages are based inland, in woodland and water settings, with an explicitly
environmental ethos (a car-free, family-friendly environment), marketed primarily and explicitly to affluent family
groups in the ABC1 SEGs, as compared with the broader targeting of the traditional holiday centres. The
accommodation in forest villages is permanent and generally more spacious than traditional holiday centres. Forest
village accommodation provides self- catering facilities and open-plan living, with luxurious top-end accommodation
standards. The focus is activity-based, with a wide range of sporting, creative and spa/therapeutic activities geared
towards both adults and children. Unlike most traditional holiday centres, which include a wide range of entertainment
and activities as part of the basic holiday package, forest village holiday providers offer a customised approach and
charge extra for individual activities. Furthermore, forest villages operate 365 days per year, offering guests a highquality experience under all types of weather through a wide range of indoor and outdoor activities and amenities.

**BUSINESS**

**Business Overview**

Center Parcs is a leading UK short-break holiday business, attracting 2.1 million guests in the financial year
ended 20 April 2023. Center Parcs operates five specially constructed holiday villages in the UK: Sherwood Forest in
Nottinghamshire, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Elveden Forest in Suffolk, Whinfell Forest in Cumbria (the “Original
**Villages”) and Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire. Each village is set in a forest environment amongst approximately 400**
acres of forest around a lake and is typically open 365 days per year.

Woodland, water and a natural environment make up the essential elements of a Center Parcs break. Within
this comfortable, quiet, car-free and family-friendly setting, each of the Center Parcs villages provides guests with
high-quality accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. In total, as of 28 December 2023, there
were 4,334 units of accommodation across its five villages, which could accommodate approximately 22,946 guests
per day at 100% occupancy. The focal point and key attraction of each village is an all-weather indoor sub-tropical
swimming paradise, featuring a selection of water activities including a wave pool, river slides and rides, children’s
pools and Jacuzzis. Center Parcs’ on-site experiences also include outdoor activities such as cycling, boating and zip
wires; indoor activities such as ten-pin bowling, badminton and pottery; and amenities such as spas, food and beverage
and retail. A significant proportion of Center Parcs’ revenue is generated from guests’ on-site spending, including for
leisure and spa activities, food and beverage and retail, representing 38.3% of total revenue in the financial year ended
20 April 2023 and 39.4% in the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023.

Center Parcs has a well-established brand in the UK, renowned for providing high-quality experiences and
facilities, targeting a primary guest base of affluent families. Center Parcs benefits from strong guest loyalty with
approximately 31.7% of guests returning within a 14-month period of their initial visit and approximately 54.1% of
guests returning within a five-year period as of financial year 2023. Furthermore, in the financial year ended 20 April
2023, 95% of guests indicated an intention to return in the future. Center Parcs believes that its business model is
difficult to replicate due to the lack of suitable locations for the development of holiday parks and high development
costs while Center Parcs is well positioned to continue to grow its business.

Center Parcs’ villages typically draw on a regional population of guests who are attracted to the convenience
of being within a relatively short driving distance from home. Over 80% of the UK population lives within a 2.5-hour
drive of at least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two-hour drive of
the village they choose to visit. Center Parcs believes that the proximity of the majority of guests to its villages
combined with the easy accessibility of the villages by car make Center Parcs a popular and convenient short break
holiday option. Occupancy levels at Center Parcs’ villages have recovered to their pre-COVID-19 levels. As a result
of village closures and occupancy restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, occupancy levels fell to 22.4%
in financial year 2021. Occupancy levels rose to 80.5% in financial year 2022, with self-imposed capacity restrictions
in place, and further to 97.1% in the financial year 2023, broadly in line with pre-COVID-19 occupancy rates. In the
36-week period ended 28 December 2023 occupancy levels were 97.1% (97.3% for the 36-week period ended 29
December 2022). Occupancy levels have averaged approximately 97.0% in the last 15 years and approximately 97.4%
in the last eight years, in each case excluding financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022 (which were impacted by COVID19 closures and self-imposed capacity restrictions).

In each of the financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, revenue and EBITDA have been broadly
evenly split amongst Center Parcs’ villages, reflecting both the individual strength of each village and the diversity of
Center Parcs’ asset base.

The map below shows the location of each of Center Parcs’ villages in the UK as of 18 April 2024.

With the exception of the financial years impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, revenue and EBITDA have
consistently grown over the past fifteen years. Total revenue and EBITDA were £593.8 million and £275.0 million,
respectively, for financial year 2023, which marks an increase compared to £503.4 million and £245.6 million,
respectively, in financial year 2022. For the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023, Center Parcs had revenue of
£439.3 million and EBITDA of £208.7 million, representing an EBITDA margin of 47.5%.

**History of the Center Parcs Group**

The concept of Center Parcs was developed by Piet Derksen in the late 1960s in the Netherlands which
envisioned a new form of self-catering and high-comfort holiday village, complemented with heated bungalows, open
fires, central heating, colour TVs and covered swimming pools. During the following two decades, Center Parcs
commenced its operations in Belgium, France and Germany.

In 1987, the first Center Parcs village opened in the UK at Sherwood Forest and the second village followed
at Elveden Forest in 1989. In 1994, Center Parcs further expanded in the UK by opening its third village, Longleat
Forest, near Bath. In 2001, Center Parcs acquired the Oasis Holiday Village (now called Whinfell Forest) in the
northwest of England from the Bourne Leisure Group, enhancing Center Parcs’ geographic footprint in the UK. In
2001, Center Parcs’ continental European operations were separated from the operations in the UK and, since then,
they have operated under separate ownership. In 2014, Center Parcs opened its fifth village, Woburn Forest, in
Bedfordshire.

Certain funds managed by affiliates of Blackstone, Inc. (the “Blackstone Funds”) bought the operating
business in May 2006 and subsequently delisted it from the London Stock Exchange where it had been listed on the
AIM in 2003 and on the Main Market in 2005. Shortly thereafter, Blackstone Funds purchased the property companies
owning the four Original Villages in June 2006. In August 2015, certain funds managed by affiliates of Brookfield
Management Inc. (the “Brookfield Funds”) acquired Center Parcs from the Blackstone Funds.

In July 2019, an indirect parent of Center Parcs (Holding 1) Limited opened a sixth village, Longford Forest,
in County Longford, Republic of Ireland. Longford Forest is outside of the Obligor Group.

**Key Strengths**

**Unique, market-leading short break holiday business.**

Center Parcs believes that it provides a unique product in the UK holiday market in terms of scale, quality
and standard of accommodation and amenities. Each Center Parcs village is set in approximately 400 acres of forest
around a lake, with numerous retail and food and beverage offerings, as well as more than 150 leisure and spa related
activities and an indoor sub-tropical swimming paradise. Each village has on average 867 units of accommodation
with capacity for approximately 4,589 guests Center Parcs believes that it is the only large-scale UK business offering
this type of high-quality family-focused, year-round, all-weather, short-break package, in a forest environment. Center
Parcs believes that it is well-positioned to benefit from demand for domestic travel, with its villages typically drawing
on a regional population of guests who live within a relatively short driving distance. In a Mintel survey of
approximately 1,000 people in November 2023, only 3% of respondents stated that they did not intend to take a
domestic holiday or short break in the next twelve months.

**Difficult to replicate concept with well-known brand and loyal, affluent customer base.**

The Center Parcs villages are characterised by a number of qualities that Center Parcs believes make its business
model difficult to replicate in the UK. These include:

- limited appropriate sites for villages, which require large forested areas near major population centres;

- long lead time needed to develop new villages due to the stringent requirements for obtaining planning permits;

- significant initial investment cost in addition to on-going capital expenditure required for further development
and operations of the business; and

- a wide range of specialised operations and planning expertise required to develop and operate a village.

Center Parcs’ unique product offering has generated strong brand recognition and guest loyalty. Center Parcs
believes that it has a brand awareness of over 90% in the UK and is considered among the top brands for high-quality
short breaks in the UK.

Center Parcs’ “intention to return” score was 95% in financial year 2023. Approximately 31.7% of Center Parcs’
guests return within a 14-month period of their initial visit and approximately 54.1% of guests return within a fiveyear period as of financial year 2023. Center Parcs maintains a guest database of approximately 323,000 active guests
as of 9 April 2024 (i.e., those who had a Center Parcs break in the last 26 months or have an active booking and are
contactable by email).

110


-----

The following graph shows the percentage of Center Parcs guests returning within a five-year period for
financial years 2019 to 2023:

Center Parcs’ guest profile has remained stable over time and consists of the highest earning categories of
the UK population. According to management estimates, Center Parcs ranked significantly over index in a number of
the Experian high end consumer classifications, with 58.9% of guests in financial year 2023 identified under the
Experian Mosaic classification as “Domestic Success”, “Prestige Positions” or “Aspiring Homemakers” based on
postcode analysis.

**Resilient growth through economic cycles.**

Resilient performance through economic cycles, during both downturns and recoveries, and also through
additions in capacity, has resulted in Center Parcs’ occupancy levels averaging over 95.8% over the last 20 years,
approximately 97.0% in the last 15 years and approximately 97.4% in the last eight years in each case excluding
financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022 (which were impacted by COVID-19 closures and self-imposed capacity
restrictions), with occupancy levels of 22.4%, 80.5%, and 97.1% in financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.
Occupancy at each of the villages has historically remained high even after the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014
despite an approximately 20% increase in Center Parcs’ accommodation available, demonstrating the depth of demand
for Center Parcs’ villages. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic conditions as well as on
guests’ willingness to travel, demand for Center Parcs’ villages remained resilient and exceeded expected operating
capacity for some breaks.

111


-----

The following graph shows Center Parcs’ occupancy rates and average units of accommodation for financial
years 2011 to 2023.

(1) Occupancy levels for financial year 2020 and 2021 were heavily impacted by the closure of all five holiday villages from 20 March
2020 to 13 July 2020, 5 November 2020 to 4 December 2020 and 21 December 2020 to 12 April 2021, during which Center Parcs was
either receiving no guests or operating at significantly reduced capacity, as well as localised closures as a result of the tier restrictions
in later periods. After the reopening of the villages on 21 April 2021, Center Parcs’ villages operated with reduced capacity during
financial years 2021 and 2022.

(2) Due to self-imposed restrictions, Center Parcs’ villages operated at 80.5% capacity during financial year 2022 which affected revenues
from accommodation and on-site sales.

High occupancy levels drive a significant proportion of revenue from guests’ on-site spending, which
represented 38.3% of Center Parcs’ total revenue in the financial year ended 20 April 2023.

The growth of ADR and RevPAL, driven by yield management initiatives, demand and on-site investment,
including in new types of accommodation and upgrades to existing accommodation, allows Center Parcs to remain
profitable in an inflationary economic environment. ADR for the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023 was
£251.01, compared with £252.14 for the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022. ADR for the financial year 2023
was £239.28, compared with £256.09 and £239.70 for financial years 2022 and 2021, respectively. RevPAL for the
36-week period ended 28 December 2023 was £243.83, compared with £245.41 for the 36-week period ended 29
December 2022. RevPAL for the financial year 2023 was £232.39, compared with £206.23. and £53.45 for financial
years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

**Consistent revenue growth with strong visibility through forward-booking model.**

With the exception of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in financial years 2020 and 2021, Center Parcs
experienced revenue growth each year over the previous ten years, with revenue growing at a CAGR of 6.0% from
financial year 2015 to financial year 2023. In addition, Center Parcs’ EBITDA (or Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable)
has grown at a CAGR of 5.0% from financial year 2015 to financial year 2023. Center Parcs places a strong emphasis

112


-----

on advance prepaid bookings, which result in significant revenue visibility, with an average of 22 weeks’ booking-toarrival time in the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023. For financial year 2023, 46% of the available
accommodation nights had been booked by the beginning of the financial year, 60% by the end of the first quarter,
73% halfway through the financial year, and 93% two months before the end of the financial year.

Under its standard terms and conditions, Center Parcs collects 30% of the accommodation cost at the time of
booking if completed more than ten weeks in advance of the short break. The balance of the cost is collected ten weeks
prior to the start of the break. If a guest books less than ten weeks prior to the arrival date, the accommodation cost is
payable in full on booking. As at 22 March 2024, bookings for financial year 2024 were 97% sold, in line with
bookings for financial year 2023 as at the same point in March 2023. Bookings for financial year 2025 were 39% sold
as at 22 March 2024, in-line with bookings for financial year 2024 as at the same point in March 2023. Historically,
at the end of each financial year, approximately 40% of the bookings for Center Parcs’ villages for the following
financial year have been sold, excluding financial years 2020 and 2021, which were impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic. As of 18 April 2024, 45% of bookings for financial year 2025 were sold.

**Sustainable cash flow generation.**

With the exception of the periods impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs’ EBITDA margins
have been underpinned by high occupancy levels and consistent growth in ADR. Relatively high EBITDA margins
combined with the negative working capital characteristics of the business due to its forward-booking model and the
relatively low maintenance capital expenditure requirements, which averaged £26.7 million per financial year from
financial year 2013 to financial year 2023, has enabled Center Parcs to be highly cash generative, with unlevered
operating cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA of 73.9% in financial year 2023 (2019: 72.6%; 2020: 68.5%; 2022:
93.1%) (comparison to 2021 excluded as COVID-19 impacts led to negative EBITDA).

**Well-invested, diversified and high-quality asset base.**

Center Parcs owns all five of its UK villages on either freehold titles or long leasehold titles, and with
remaining lease terms of between 50 years and 977 years, Center Parcs’ asset base has a long life and is diversified
and stable. In financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, revenue and EBITDA have been broadly evenly split
amongst its villages, located in different parts of the UK, reflecting both the individual strength of each village and
the diversity of Center Parcs’ asset base.

Center Parcs has an on-going capital expenditure programme to maintain and enhance the quality of its asset
base, pursuant to which it has invested approximately £635 million from financial year 2013 through financial year
2023. Of this investment, £283 million represents maintenance capital expenditures. The remainder represents
investment capital expenditure, of which £154 million was invested to upgrade existing accommodation, £105 million
was invested in on-site development, including new leisure activities, food and beverage offerings and facilities
upgrades and £17 million was invested in its Digital Roadmap project. In addition, Center Parcs incurred
approximately £250 million of total initial development costs in respect of building Woburn Forest.

In financial years 2022 and 2023, capital expenditure primarily related to a range of ongoing village
refurbishments of accommodation, restaurants, retail outlets, spas and other offerings and facilities. Center Parcs has
added 300 new units of accommodation since 2015 and, on average since 2018, refurbishes 300 to 400 units of
accommodation per year.

**Experienced management team with a track record of innovation.**

Center Parcs has an experienced management team with a proven ability to execute its business plans and
achieve results. In addition, Center Parcs’ management team has a track record of innovation reflected in its yield
management initiatives, innovation in on-site activities and food and beverage offerings, as well as development of
new types of accommodation to help drive ADR. In 2014, the management team successfully opened Woburn Forest
on time and on budget. With an average length of service of over 15 years by individual members of its management
team, the management team is highly experienced in providing the services that set Center Parcs apart from other UK
leisure and holiday providers. Center Parcs also benefits from the operational expertise, relationships, and
management experience of Brookfield.

**Strategy**

**Continue to grow revenue through yield management, flexible pricing, targeted marketing and customer**
**relationship management.**

Center Parcs actively manages pricing across its villages to maintain its high level of occupancy and to
optimise yield during periods of high demand. All bookings are made directly with Center Parcs, with approximately
92% of accommodation bookings made online in financial year 2023. Together with its strong emphasis on advance
bookings (average 22 weeks’ booking-to-arrival time period in financial year 2023), this provides Center Parcs with
significant operational information, allowing it to respond quickly to customer trends in order to optimise its pricing.
Center Parcs will continue to operate a flexible pricing model to further grow revenue, and to develop its customer
relationship management initiatives to increase demand from the affluent families that form its core guest base.

Center Parcs’ guest database of approximately 323,000 active guests (i.e., those who had a Center Parcs break in the
last 26 months or have an active booking and are contactable by email) allows it to undertake targeted marketing
campaigns using a range of channels, including direct mailings, online and digital marketing, television campaigns
and email programmes focused on both existing customers and targeted acquisition of new affluent families.

**Continue to invest in revenue-enhancing upgrades of Center Parcs accommodation offering and to expand**
**available capacity.**

Center Parcs plans to continue to invest in upgrading the accommodation and facilities in its villages, and to
introduce new accommodation and on-site activities. Since 2007, Center Parcs has significantly upgraded all units of
accommodation at the Original Villages at an average estimated cost of approximately £50,000 per lodge. Following
the upgrade of all existing units of accommodation, Center Parcs has started a cycle of refurbishment for such
accommodation which is important to maintain quality and generate repeat business, with approximately 300 to 400
units of accommodation refurbished annually.

There is also capacity for additional new builds of premium lodges at Center Parcs’ villages, which typically
achieve a premium over the rate achieved on standard lodges. Center Parcs believes that such premium lodges attract
affluent guests who are more likely to be high on-site spenders. Center Parcs currently has planning permission to
build a further 85 units of accommodation. The new units of accommodation are expected to include waterside lodges,
apartments and other executive lodges.

**Disciplined investment in village experience.**

Center Parcs believes that there are several substantial development projects that could profitably expand
Center Parcs’ offering, including Project Atlantis, which involves the strategic enhancement of the signature subtropical swimming paradise that features at each village. Center Parcs spent approximately £46 million between 2012
and 2023 on implementing Project Atlantis. Improvements included the addition of a new raft ride, the Tropical
Cyclone at Whinfell Forest, and a new play area featuring numerous slides and water features at Elveden Forest,
Longleat Forest and Sherwood Forest. Center Parcs has also invested approximately £6.5 million in the refurbishment
and expansion of the Aqua Sana spa facility at Longleat Forest and has recently finished a planned refurbishment of
the Aqua Sana spa facility at Elveden Forest at an estimated investment of £8.6 million. The Aqua Sana spa at Elveden
reopened in the second quarter of 2024.

Center Parcs also intends to introduce new leisure activities at each village on a regular basis, as well as
innovate upon its existing offering of leisure activities. Development opportunities include introducing zip wires,
electric boats and expanding indoor climbing activities to all villages. Center Parcs believes that such investments
provide an enriched holiday experience particularly for the affluent families that form its core guest base, and that an
improved on-site unique offering helps to drive both accommodation and on-site revenue.

During the closure of Center Parcs’ villages as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs reduced
capital expenditure by ceasing and rephasing non-essential capital projects as closures were announced. See “—
_Strategy—Continue to increase profitability through controlling costs”._

**Grow on-site spend.**

As Center Parcs’ guests typically remain on-site for the duration of their stay, Center Parcs believes that there
are opportunities to further grow on-site spend further. For example, Center Parcs has continued to develop a

114


-----

programme of enhanced differentiation in pricing where prices of various offerings are expected to become flexible
across seasons, days of the week and times of day to more accurately reflect guest demand.

Center Parcs has franchise, licensing and concession agreements with various providers. These concession
partners enable guests to benefit from high street brand offerings and Center Parcs to increase profitability through
increased on-site spend. Center Parcs reviews these agreements periodically to ensure that they remain economically
attractive and meet its guests’ requirements.

While on-site spend as a proportion of total revenue decreased to 35.4% in financial year 2022 due to COVID19 restrictions in the beginning of the period, after the lifting of COVID-19 related restrictions in the UK in 2022, onsite spend recovered to 38.3% of Center Parcs’ total revenue from on-site spend in the financial year 2023.

**Continue to increase profitability through controlling costs.**

Center Parcs benefits from having a flexible cost base. Because of the high level of forward booking visibility
of the business, Center Parcs is typically able to manage its cost base effectively to meet its business requirements.
For example, in light of the current rising cost of living environment in the UK, Center Parcs believes it is equipped
to reduce operating hours and optimise staff schedules across its food and beverage offerings and leisure activities to
reduce variable costs when forward booking information indicates a reduced number of guests or decreases in on-site
spending.

Center Parcs also hedges a large portion of its short-term energy requirements, reducing the effect of energy
market volatility on its operational costs. As part of the strategy to seek profitable growth, it intends to continue to
generate cost savings through increased efficiency at each village and at its head office.

During the closure of Center Parcs’ villages, Center Parcs ensured stringent cost controls and implemented
strict cash management procedures to reduce capital expenditure and conserve liquidity, including the rephasing of
capital investment projects and cessation of non-essential operating activities as closures were announced. Center
Parcs estimates that approximately 37.2% of its total capital expenditure for financial year 2021 was rephased. In
addition, Center Parcs also participated in a number of UK government support measures for businesses to reduce the
impact of the closures on its liquidity.

**Business Description**

**Product Offering**

Center Parcs’ focus is on the short-break holiday market. Center Parcs’ guests can choose from three predefined break durations: the weekend (Friday to Monday), mid-week (Monday to Friday) or a week (Friday to Friday
or Monday to Monday, comprised of a weekend break and mid-week break). Guests can also book combinations of
these breaks. Accommodation is charged on a per-break rather than per-sleeper or per-night basis (with the exception
of the spa suites which are sold on a per-night basis). Approximately 96% of holidays booked in financial year 2023,
with the exception of spa breaks, spa suites and corporate bookings, were for three- or four-night breaks.

Although located near urban centres, Center Parcs villages are each set within approximately 400 acres of
forest around a lake and offer year-round, all-weather holidays in a car-free natural environment.

Center Parcs generated 69%, 65%, and 62% of its total revenue from accommodation in financial years 2021,
2022 and 2023, respectively. For the 36-week period ended 29 December 2022 and the 36-week period ended 28
December 2023, Center Parcs generated 63% and 61% of its revenue from accommodation, respectively. Excluding
financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022, which were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in March 2020,
Center Parcs’ occupancy rates have averaged approximately 96.7% in the last 15 years.

Each village offers more than 150 leisure and spa related activities, along with on average 15 bars and
restaurants and 5 shops. Center Parcs generated 31.0%, 35.4% and 38.3% of its total revenue from on-site spend in
financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

**Accommodation**

Accommodation is a critical part of the overall guest experience at Center Parcs and the key financial driver,
representing 62% of total revenue, or £366.5 million, in financial year 2023 and 61% of total revenue, or
£266.2 million, in the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023. As of 28 December 2023, Center Parcs offered 4,334

115

units of accommodation across its five villages. Investment, maintenance and refurbishment are on-going to keep all
accommodation up to date, fresh and contemporary.

Accommodation at each village comprises a range of one-to-four-bedroom lodges (with six-bedroom lodges
at Sherwood Forest, Whinfell Forest and Woburn Forest), and luxury spa suits, one- and two-bedroom apartments and
hotel rooms, some of which include self-catering facilities. Each village offers a range of different grades of
accommodation, from entry level woodland units to exclusive lodges and treehouses with Jacuzzis, steam rooms and
an assortment of premium facilities, as well as a small number of apartments and hotel rooms. Center Parcs has a
continual cycle of lodge refurbishment. 3,244 units of accommodation have been upgraded as at 28 December 2023
under the current refurbishment cycle.

Elveden Forest. Subsequently, Center Parcs has added a further eight Spa Suites units at Woburn Forest, including
two new Spa Suites since opening. These are luxurious one-bedroom units adjacent to the Aqua Sana spa and provide
direct access to the Spa facilities with entry included as part of the tariff. Unlike all other accommodation types, they
are sold on a per night basis.

paddle boats and activities such as canoeing and sailing are on offer. All the villages have an outdoor activity centre
providing activities such as Segways®, archery, quad biking and laser combat. Sherwood Forest and Whinfell Forest
also have nature centres which allow guests to learn about the village’s wildlife as well as provide activities such as
falconry, woodland walks and educational tours. Center Parcs also offers festive-themed activities from November
through the Christmas period as villages are transformed into “Winter Wonderland”. Center Parcs’ focus on capacity
management has enabled extra sessions for guests, further increasing profitability. New outdoor activities recently
introduced include zip wires, mini tree trekking for younger children, woodland wheelers, off road explorers, a vertical
drop challenge “The Drop”, an inflatable “Aqua Parc” and a children’s boating experience “Mini Captain’s
Adventure”.

**Indoor Activities**

Indoor activities include traditional activities, such as badminton, ten pin bowling, snooker, pool and table
tennis, all of which are consistently popular with guests and accordingly, have generated consistent revenue streams.
Access to a gymnasium and arcade are also available across all villages. Classes are offered for activities such as
fencing and climbing. Pottery painting was introduced initially at Longleat Forest in 2010 and has been rolled out to
all villages. It caters to all age groups and is a popular activity which has seen significant revenue growth.

Ten pin bowling is also a popular activity with guests. There are two bowling locations at Sherwood Forest
and Woburn Forest and one location at each other village.

New indoor activities more recently introduced include football pool and an “Indoor Climbing Adventure”
which has been introduced across all villages and expanded.

**Children’s Activities**

Center Parcs offers a wide range of activities tailored for children aged from six months to 14 years. Many
such activities are offered through the “Activity Den”. Trained staff offer a spectrum of activities, from traditional
crèche and soft play areas for toddlers to hair braiding and activities such as “Den Building” for older children and
teenagers. In addition to the “Activity Den”, classes for younger guests are offered in sports including football and
cricket. Roller skating and junior archery are also popular.

**Cycle Hire**

The car-free environment makes cycling a key feature of the Center Parcs experience. Each village has a fleet
of cycles. Center Parcs reviews its fleet regularly and invests significantly in new ranges of cycles to replace older
models. In line with the initiative to pre-book more activities, pre-booking of cycles represented around 77% of total
cycle bookings in financial year 2023, reducing queuing times and improving planning.

**Aqua Sana — Spa and Treatments**

The award-winning Aqua Sana spa is open to outside guests as well as to village guests, with most bookings
made in advance and pre-paid prior to arrival. Aqua Sana comprised 5% of total revenue and 14% of total on-site
revenue, or £31.3 million, in financial year 2023 and 5% of total revenue and 13% of total on-site revenue, or £21.9
million, in the 36-week period ended 29 December 2023.

Each village has between 15 and 25 treatment rooms and extensive spa facilities with a variety of different
“experience rooms”, hydrotherapy pools, saunas and meditation areas. Treatments range from massage through to
more advanced facials and beauty treatments for both men and women.

Aqua Sana facilities have benefited from on-going refurbishment and upgrades, with approximately
£3.6 million invested in the last three financial years. During financial years 2023 and 2024 the ‘Aqua Sana’ spa
facilities and accompanying food and beverage facilities at Elveden were significantly upgraded. This required the
closure of the spa to guests, with a scheduled re-opening taking place in the second quarter of financial year 2024.
Retail shops offer a wide variety of beauty products from well-known brands, including Elemis and Voya. The Aqua
Sana offer at all villages includes a “Vitalé Café Bar” food and beverage offer serving light meals and refreshments.
In 2023, Aqua Sana Sherwood Forest won the team of the Year at the Professional Beauty Awards and in 2024 Aqua
Sana won employer of the year at the Professional Beauty Awards.

118


-----

Center Parcs also offers spa suites at certain of the villages that provide a package of an overnight stay
combined with access to the Aqua Sana. Unlike other accommodations, these can be booked on a nightly basis.
Woburn Forest opened with six spa suite units and a further two have been subsequently added.

Online booking is available for Aqua Sana through its website. Aqua Sana receives dedicated operational
and sales and marketing support. Center Parcs will continue to refurbish and upgrade facilities and invest in system
enhancements at the Aqua Sana spas.

**Conference Facilities**

Sherwood Forest and Woburn Forest offer purpose-built conference and meeting facilities. Woburn Forest
provides the largest conference facilities and can accommodate up to 400 delegates. Each of the villages offers an
extensive range of leisure activities, which can be used during conferences for teambuilding purposes, such as raft
building, tree trekking or aerial adventures. The use of these conference and meeting facilities are booked through
Center Parcs’ Corporate Events division.

**On-site Food and Beverage**

Center Parcs seeks to provide its guests with an extensive range of dining experiences, with on-site food and
beverage sales comprising 16% of total revenue and 43% of total on-site revenue, or £97.2 million, in financial year
2023 and comprising 17% of total revenue and 43% of total on-site revenue, or £74.7 million, in the 36-week period
ended 28 December 2023.

Each village has an average of 14 restaurants and bars. This provides a choice of restaurants, some targeted
at families, with play areas and children’s menus while others offer premium dining. Center Parcs believes that these
on-site food and beverage facilities are popular with its guests and have enabled higher sustained pricing and limited
promotional activity compared with restaurants located on high streets. Menus are reviewed regularly and restaurants
have been refurbished and upgraded on a rolling cycle to ensure that standards and the experience are maintained to a
high standard. In financial years 2021 and 2022, Center Parcs carried out major refurbishments at “Vitale” at Sherwood
Forest, “The Pancake House” at Elveden Forest, “Refresh” at Woburn Forest, and “Rajinda Pradesh” at Sherwood
Forest and Longleat Forest

Concession partners operate certain outlets and account for approximately one third of on-site spend on food
and beverage. Approximately one-sixth of the outlets are operated under a concession agreement with The Big Table
Group. Under this concession agreement, the concession fees payable by The Big Table Group to Center Parcs is the
greater of a set minimum fee (which was achieved in each of financial year 2022 and financial year 2023) or a specified
percentage of their respective revenue. Revenue generated by The Big Table Group Concession partners bring industry
operational expertise to Center Parcs and have brought high street brand names such as Café Rouge, Las Iguanas,
Amalfi and Bella Italia to the villages.

**On-site Retail**

Center Parcs offers a range of both food and non-food retail at each of its villages, which comprised 5% of
total revenue and 14% of total on-site revenue, or £31.9 million, in financial year 2023, and comprised 6% of total
revenue and 14% of total on-site revenue, or £24.5 million, in the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023.

The retail outlets have been designed to complement the activities at Center Parcs and the requirements of
its guests. Each village has an average of five main retail outlets and a number of satellite retail offers. Center Parcs
also entered into an agreement with Joules for its retail shops at each of Center Parcs’ sites.

The on-site supermarket, the ParcMarket, provides guests with a full range of products comparable to a high
street convenience store for guests’ self-catering requirements. The shop includes a range of fresh foods, fresh breads
and pastries baked on-site, and a wide range of wines, beers and spirits as well as a comprehensive grocery offer.
Prices are monitored against comparably sized outlets in the surrounding areas.

Each village also has a confectionery shop, a gift shop with a wide variety of gifts and souvenirs and a toy
store catering for children of all ages. There is also a shop within the cycle centre.

Since 2008, the World Duty Free Group (part of the Avolta Group) has been Center Parcs’ strategic retail
partner. The World Duty Free Group’s management of these retail units has allowed Center Parcs to develop a
partnership with an operator with a well-established retail network. The presence of the concession partners enables
guests to benefit from high street brand offerings and Center Parcs to leverage industry expertise.

The term of the second underlease is 72 years, five months and 29 days from 25 August 2000 to 22 February 2073 for
a current passing rent of £44,225 per annum (pursuant to a January 2020 rent review). Both underleases had a first
rent review in July 2004, their second rent review (due in July 2009) was settled in 2010 and third rent review (due in
2014) was settled in July 2015. The most recent rent review was settled in January 2020. Rent reviews are carried out
every five years. Rent reviews are upwards only but limited by reference to revenue increase relative to whichever of
the preceding review periods has the greatest revenue. The remainder of the property (an outdoor activity centre) at
Longleat Forest is held under a lease between The Most Honourable Alexander George Seventh Marquis of Bath,
including his heirs and successors, and Longleat Property Limited. The term of this lease is 64 years, one month and
25 days from 1 January 2009 to 25 February 2073 for a current passing rent of £20,000 per annum. This lease is
subject to a rent review mechanism on similar terms as the above-mentioned two underleases.

**Whinfell Forest**

Whinfell Forest was initially built by Rank and opened in 1997. It was subsequently sold to Bourne Leisure
and then acquired by Center Parcs in 2001. Whinfell Forest comprises approximately 415 acres of land and is home
to one of the UK’s last remaining colonies of red squirrels, which can be seen regularly throughout the village. In
financial year 2023, Whinfell Forest generated £115.2 million in revenue and £56.0 million EBITDA. For the 36week period ended 28 December 2023, Whinfell Forest generated £86.4 million in revenue and £43.2 million
EBITDA.

_Location_

The property is located between Penrith and Temple Sowerby on the A66. Penrith is the closest town
(population approximately 15,000) and is approximately four miles west of the village.

_Transport Links_

The M6 motorway is approximately seven miles to the west of the village, providing motorway access to
Scotland and the northwest of England, as well as to the Midlands and the south of England. The closest rail facilities
are located in Penrith, which provides connections to major centres, including Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester,
Birmingham and London.

_Catchment Area_

Whinfell Forest is the most northerly of the Center Parcs’ villages and it therefore tends to attract guests from
Scotland, the north of England and north Wales. The main catchment areas include Glasgow and the west coast of
Scotland, Newcastle and the north east, Liverpool, Manchester and the North West. However, due to the proximity of
the village to the Lake District, this facility also has a higher proportion of long-distance guests.

_Tenure_

The property is held under three separate titles - one being freehold and two being long leasehold. The
leasehold titles are held under two leases scheduled to expire in 2120 for a total passing rental of £1,000 per annum.
A premium of £3,288,500 (plus VAT) was previously paid in instalments for one lease, and a premium of £112,000
was paid in respect of the other lease.

**Woburn Forest**

The fifth village in Center Parcs’ portfolio comprises approximately 357 acres of mature forested land in
Woburn, Bedfordshire and was opened to paying guests on 6 June 2014. Woburn Forest was built with the same core
offer as the Original Villages but introduced modern and contemporary accommodation designs and has a higher
proportion of premium accommodation offerings.

123


-----

In financial year 2023, Woburn Forest generated £115.3 million in revenue and £58.9 million EBITDA. For
the 36-week period ended 28 December 2023, Woburn Forest generated £85.2 million in revenue and £43.9 million
EBITDA.

_Location_

Woburn Forest is located approximately 60 miles north of London in Bedfordshire.

_Transport Links_

Woburn Forest is six miles from the M1 motorway. The village also has convenient rail links, with a journey
time of 45 minutes by train from London St. Pancras to Flitwick train station, located approximately two miles away.

_Catchment Area_

Woburn Forest is the only Center Parcs village within a 90-minute drive time of London households. Woburn
Forest also has the highest volume of core target households within that drive time. For much of this population, the
penetration for Center Parcs has historically been low.

_Tenure_

The property is held in leasehold title under the terms of a lease with Woburn Estate Company Limited and
Bedford Estates Nominees Limited. The term of the lease is 99 years from 24 December 2010 for a current passing
rent of £840,635 (payable from March 2023) per annum. A premium of £3,540,600 was paid to the lessor. The lease
contains a rent review clause with an upwards only review to take place every 5 years (with the next review due on
31 March 2028) by reference to the greater of an increase in rent in line with the retail price index, a fixed percentage
increase in the passing rent or the historic increase in revenue at Woburn Forest.

**Village Development**

The first step in the development of a new Center Parcs village is the identification of an appropriate site.
There are limited appropriate sites for villages as the Center Parcs’ model requires large forested areas near major
population centres. Following the identification of the site, planning permits for the development of the village need
to be obtained. The development of a new village has a long lead time due to the stringent requirements for these
permits. In addition, a wide range of specialised operations and planning expertise are required to develop a new
village, including cost plans and budgets as well as studies assessing the economic, geological and ecological impact
of the new village. The planning phase is followed by tender and procurement processes for the construction. These
processes are then followed by the actual construction and pre-opening training of village staff.

From time to time, Center Parcs evaluates suitable locations for new villages to develop or acquire. In July
2021, Center Parcs announced that it had secured an option agreement to acquire 553 acres of privately owned
woodland at Oldhouse Warren off Balcombe Road, Worth, Crawley, West Sussex. After undertaking site surveys and
pre-planning permission works on the site, Center Parcs concluded that the potential sixth site at Oldhouse Warren is
not a suitable location for a Center Parcs village. As a result, Center Parcs announced on 8 February 2023 that it will
not be progressing plans to develop a forest holiday village at Oldhouse Warren. Center Parcs also announced plans
to continue searching for a suitable location for a potential sixth site in the UK.

There are significant costs associated with the development of a village. For example, the development cost
for Woburn Phase 1 was approximately £250 million. The actual building of the village involved the construction of
706 units of accommodation in addition to the Village Square, the Indoor Plaza, the Subtropical Swimming Paradise
and other activity and leisure areas. Center Parcs estimates that the current cost of developing a new village would be
between £350 million and £450 million.

In July 2019, an indirect parent of Center Parcs (Holding 1) Limited opened a sixth village, Longford Forest,
in County Longford in the Republic of Ireland. Longford Forest is outside of the Obligor Group. The 400-acre
Longford Forest village includes 466 lodges and 30 apartments, which can accommodate approximately 2,700 guests,
more than 100 indoor and outdoor family activities including the Subtropical Swimming Paradise and the Aqua Sana
spa and a range of restaurants and shops. The development of Longford Forest cost approximately €265 million.
Center Parcs believes the development of Longford Forest resulted in the creation of approximately 750 jobs during

124


-----

the construction and approximately 1,000 permanent jobs after Longford Forest’s opening. Permission has been
secured for an extension to Longford Forest, including almost 200 new lodges.

**Village Operations**

**Operational Management**

Each of Center Parcs’ villages is managed by a Village Director and a deputy Village Director, who oversee
the events manager, guest services manager and on-village revenue manager. Other individuals responsible for the
management of the village are the technical services manager, housekeeping manager, leisure services manager,
village financial controller, human resources manager, security manager, village duty managers and food and beverage
manager. As of 28 December 2023, Center Parcs had an average of approximately 1,652 employees at each village.
Center Parcs’ villages are akin to small towns with their own infrastructure, including gas, water and power provision.

One of the key focus points of village operations is guest satisfaction. 93% of guests rated their break as
“excellent” or “good” in financial year 2023. Center Parcs uses the “Delivering Excellent Service” metric to measure
service provision across offerings. Guest feedback, particularly the monitoring of “Delivering Excellent Service”
scores through guest surveys, forms a central part of the internal review and improvement process for each village.
Each operating unit at a village has target “Delivering Excellent Service” scores as part of its bonus schemes.

**Risk Management**

Each village’s Village Director is supported by an independent health and safety team at the head office.
Each village has regular risk meetings throughout the year. Center Parcs’ risk management policy focuses on health
and safety including guest safety, food safety, lodge safety, employee safety, fire safety and child protection. Center
Parcs also centrally monitors enterprise risk and key performance indicators.

**Supply Chain**

Center Parcs primarily has a centralised procurement function to ensure quality, competitiveness, regulatory
and ethical policy compliance, continuity and consistency across its five villages. Center Parcs mainly uses national
suppliers that service all five villages, ensuring economies of scale and commercial leverage, and therefore controlling
overall costs. Center Parcs’ villages also use local suppliers for certain goods and services to ensure provenance and
speed of service as well as to support corporate social responsibility initiatives. Altogether, Center Parcs manages
approximately 2,100 suppliers centrally and purchased approximately £130 million of goods and services in financial
year 2023. Center Parcs has a dedicated sourcing team focusing on utilities, food and beverage, fixtures, fittings and
inventory, technical and ground services, laundry services and leisure goods and services.

**Guest Profile**

Over 80% of the UK population lives within a 2.5-hour drive of at least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and
the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two-hour drive of the village they choose to visit.

In financial year 2023, 81% of Center Parcs’ guests were families, with families with pre-school children,
families with school age children and families with mixed age children comprising 27%, 33% and 21% of all guests,
respectively. However, Center Parcs’ guest profile changes within the year depending on school holiday breaks.
During the peak holiday seasons in financial year 2023, for example, 88% of Center Parcs’ guests were families, with
families with pre-school children, families with school age children and families with mixed age children comprising
20%, 43% and 25% of all guests, respectively, while families made up 78% of all of Center Parcs’ guests during offpeak seasons, with families with pre-school children, families with school age children and families with mixed age
children comprising 30%, 28% and 20% of all guests, respectively.

According to management estimates, Center Parcs ranked significantly over index in a number of the
Experian high end consumer classifications, with 59% of guests in financial year 2023 identified under the Experian
Mosaic classification as “Domestic Success”, “Prestige Positions” or “Aspiring Homemakers” based on postcode
analysis.

125


-----

**Marketing**

Center Parcs is positioned as a relatively upmarket, high-quality short-break holiday option for affluent
families wanting to spend time together, away from the stresses and routine of everyday life. Brand value and integrity
underlies Center Parcs’ marketing strategy.

Center Parcs engages directly with guests, with approximately 92% of bookings made online in financial
year 2023 and the remaining through its in-house contact centre. Center Parcs does not deal with online affiliates or
travel agents. As such, there are no commission payments made to third parties selling Center Parcs to consumers.

Center Parcs’ accommodation pricing strategy is based on a dynamic demand driven model, where prices
start at a low level in order to generate demand and generally rise as sales increase along with demand as the shortbreak holiday dates approach. This approach rewards and encourages early booking (Center Parcs has an 18-month
booking horizon) and has helped Center Parcs increase revenues through economic cycles and has allowed it to
maintain and improve occupancy rates. This is reflected in “intention to return” scores of 95% in financial year 2023.

The dynamic demand-driven pricing model, overseen by its dedicated pricing team, enables management to
optimise accommodation revenues by linking price to demand throughout the year. The pricing model utilises granular
data, mapping holidays by length of break, accommodation type (with over 180 different types across the villages for
the purposes of the pricing model), time of year as well as by village and incorporates the previous year’s average
price as a base, adjusted for inflation and other factors (including the time of week, whether the period is peak or offpeak and high occupancy versus quieter occupancy periods). This allows Center Parcs to smooth out its pricing across
the seasons, adapt its accommodation pricing to guest demand and facilitate its yield management. Prices are reviewed
daily and any changes can be updated on the Center Parcs website within 30 minutes. Any prices can be benchmarked
against other villages, to adapt the progression of bookings against the expected booking profile.

Center Parcs’ on-site pricing is generally less variable than its accommodation pricing. All activities except
for the Subtropical Swimming Paradise are booked on a pay-per-use principle, and all activities are available for prebooking. In financial year 2023, more than 60% of on-site Leisure activities were pre-booked and pre-paid. Center
Parcs maintains clear price lists for its activities to increase transparency.

Center Parcs maintains a guest database of approximately 323,000 active guests as of 9 April 2024 (i.e., those
who had a Center Parcs break in the last 26 months or have an active booking and are contactable by email). Over
31% of guests return within 14 months, and approximately 54% of guests return within five years as of financial year
2023. Given the cost effectiveness of targeting guests who have previously stayed at a Center Parcs village, a
significant proportion of the Center Parcs marketing budget is focused on communicating with its existing guest base,
targeting repeat visits and the sale of on-site activities. When making a booking all guests create a Center Parcs
account, which allows them to store their information and party details and simplify their ongoing booking process
with Center Parcs. This is also an opportunity for Center Parcs to track and analyse data for insight over time. The
retention strategy focuses on an email programme that maintains communication with guests, from initial enquiry for
information, through booking of accommodation, pre-arrival booking of activities, to the post-visit Welcome Home
and Anniversary emails. Constantly evolving communications methods in line with consumer behaviour, Center Parcs
are moving to eradicate paper communications. Recently the Village Life magazine was moved to an online digital
communication rather than paper, with content complementing the ongoing lifestyle blog, “Under The Treetops”. A
series of pre-arrival emails to guests encourages them to plan and book their itinerary of activities and restaurant
bookings well in advance and, again, this has moved to be purely via digital channels. In addition, Center Parcs
constantly monitors on-going guest feedback through its online guest service questionnaire, which has been completed
by approximately 31% of guests in financial year 2023, as well as through various quantitative and qualitative research
projects (including surveys and focus groups), website behavioural tracking and social media reporting and monitoring
to review the various elements of its business. Guest questionnaires are also exclusively online delivering industryleading response percentages and therefore rich guest feedback. Such research helps guide marketing communications,
and has also been the basis of improvements in both guest service and product development (for example,
accommodation refurbishment, pool upgrades, new leisure activities and software developments). Center Parcs also
offers a “come back soon” price guarantee to guests when they leave thus incentivising guests to return and quickly
rebook within a month of their visit.

In addition to its retention strategy, Center Parcs integrates acquisition marketing activities across a mix of
available marketing channels such as TV, radio, web, email, newspapers and magazines, outdoor and social media,
all aimed primarily towards a more affluent market to bring in new affluent guests that have the potential to provide

126


-----

repeat business and good lifetime value through multiple return visits. Typically, Center Parcs runs an integrated crosschannel media campaign, led by television and internet advertising and search, supplemented by email, social media
and other forms of public relations activities, all of which are seasonally, geographically and demographically targeted
for optimal effects. The largest spend of the year is focused upon the key booking period from late December through
to late February, when large numbers of UK consumers are in the market for holidays and short-breaks and the
propensity to book is higher.

Center Parcs operates a service programme called “Delivering Excellent Service” to enhance the level of
service it provides to its guests. All staff have been trained under the Making Memorable Moments Programme. This
effort has yielded improved results, as measured by responses to guest questionnaires.

**Information Technology**

Center Parcs’ has a modern information technology platform utilising proprietary and third-party hardware
and software, including market-standard booking and customer relationship management tools, firewalls and data
protection mechanisms, off-site servers, and dedicated on-site IT staff. Center Parcs uses price variability between
seasons and across villages in order to respond to changes in demand, local economic conditions, and guest spending
profiles.

Center Parcs maintains a sophisticated customer database with fully integrated accommodation and on-site
spend data, designed to improve customer analytics, full social media and customer relationship management and a
robust online platform recognising individuals and profile segments. As a result, Center Parcs is building the future
opportunity to (i) improve its ability to identify and target the most profitable guest profiles and customer lifetime
value; (ii) develop and facilitate access to guest data for guest-facing service departments and provide more targeted
guest services, such as differentiating between first-time guests and repeat guests and recognising differing family
make ups, such as children’s ages; (iii) boost individual guest identification indicating individual preferences to enable
Center Parcs to better tailor guest services; and (iv) allow for an improved user booking experience by providing a
seamless, consistent and more responsive process across its booking systems.

**Bookings Systems**

Center Parcs’ pre-arrivals booking systems comprise a telephone-based in-house contact centre and an online
service via its website. Center Parcs significantly improved cost efficiency and efficiency of email and call handling
through the consolidation of its call centre operations to its head office in 2010. Guests are able to book leisure
activities in advance through these booking systems, which do not apply any booking fees. In addition to benefiting
guests, these pre-arrivals booking systems help optimise yield management and give Center Parcs greater planning
time to ensure it meets demand through extra sessions/capacity. A dedicated revenue management team ensures that
accommodation demand and capacity are constantly monitored to ensure revenue optimisation. In financial year 2023,
more than 84% of activities were pre-booked and pre-paid prior to arrival. All bookings are made directly with Center
Parcs, with approximately 92% of accommodation bookings made online in financial year 2023. Guests can book
either online (using Center Parcs’ website or mobile site) or on-site using purpose built on-site booking points.

courses and over 200 technical and professional courses each year to its employees.

128


-----

**Maintenance and Inspection**

Center Parcs uses both planned preventative maintenance and reactive maintenance regimes to ensure that
its accommodation, facilities, amenities, plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings are inspected and maintained to a
standard acceptable to its target guest base.

The planned preventative maintenance regime helps to ensure that Center Parcs has visibility of the total cost
of maintaining its assets and the cost of replacing end of life assets. The reactive maintenance regime ensures that
Center Parcs has a technical services team on call to attend to any maintenance issue 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
The technical services teams are complimented by external experts, technicians and engineers as required.

The Director of Operations and the senior management team of each village meet regularly. The Director of
Operations and CEO undertake an annual inspection of standards and maintenance related issues and there is an annual
asset review undertaken with the CEO, Development Director, Head of Assets, Director of Operations and Village
Director.

**Insurance**

Center Parcs maintains insurance of the types it believes to be commercially reasonable and available to
businesses in its industry, and in amounts exceeding the statutory minimums. It maintains insurance policies that
provide coverage for property related risks, business interruption following loss of or damage to property, employers’
liability and public and product liability.

Center Parcs’ current insurance policies expire on 30 June of each year. While insurance premiums as a
whole have remained relatively stable over recent years, property insurance premiums have increased in recent years
as a result of global natural disasters and extreme weather conditions. In addition, cybersecurity insurance premiums
have also increased as a result of increasing rates of cybersecurity threats around the world. Center Parcs cannot predict
the level of the premiums it may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage or the level of insurance
available.

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, Center Parcs has been and is involved in disputes and litigation related to its business and
operations.

In particular, the nature of the leisure activities which it provides and the industry in which it operates tend
to expose Center Parcs to claims by guests for personal injuries. Center Parcs investigates such claims thoroughly and,
depending on the circumstances, will settle or defend the claim accordingly. Center Parcs may also be subject to
investigations and prosecution for alleged violations of health and safety laws and regulations.

Center Parcs is not currently party to any actual or threatened legal proceedings or disputes which may have
a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.

**Regulation and Environment**

The villages operated by Center Parcs are subject to a number of national and local laws relating to the
operation of holiday breaks, including those regarding the sale of alcohol and offering of entertainment. Operating in
forested areas with endangered wildlife, the villages are also required to adhere to strict environmental codes.

Center Parcs’ operations are subject to increasingly stringent national and local environmental laws and
regulations, including laws and regulations governing air and noise emissions; wastewater and storm water discharges
and uses; oil spillages; the maintenance of storage tanks and the use, release, storage, disposal, handling and
transportation of, and exposure to, chemicals and hazardous substances; and otherwise relating to health, safety and
the protection of the environment and natural resources and the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater.

Center Parcs is committed to operating in a sustainable and ethical way. In 2010, Center Parcs took the
decision to drastically reduce its carbon footprint and positively contribute towards the global effort to tackle climate
change. Center Parcs set a target of reducing its carbon emissions by 20% over 10 years (2010-2020). Center Parcs
achieved this target two years ahead of its original goal. In total, Center Parcs reduced its carbon footprint by more
than 13,000 tonnes over this period.

This reduction was achieved through a number of targeted capital investments and projects. At Sherwood
Forest, Center Parcs works with a specialist energy supplier to provide the village with electricity and heat generated

129


-----

by anaerobic digestion. The anaerobic digestion plant supplies 27% of the village’s heat and 80% of the required
electricity. Woburn Forest was designed with an energy centre to supply heating and hot water to lodges and central
buildings across the village, which helps deliver energy more efficiently.

Center Parcs’ focus on sustainability includes the preservation and enhancement of the natural environment.
Overall, Center Parcs directly spends approximately £6.0 million per annum on maintaining and improving Center
Parcs’ environment, and has 150 employees whose roles focus entirely on environmental sustainability. Each village
maintains over 70% of its land as undeveloped forest. Since its opening, Woburn Forest has experienced a 10%
increase in bird species, highlighting Center Parcs’ continued focus on sustainability, ecology and biodiversity.

Center Parcs has set a number of further sustainability targets for 2030. Center Parcs aims to reduce its carbon
emissions by a further 30% by 2030 from a baseline year of 2020. As part of this commitment, by 2030, Center Parcs
intends to source 50% of its energy from renewable sources, install biogas plants at two more of the villages, transition
its fleet of vehicles to 100% electric or hybrid vehicles, reduce energy use by 5% and water use by 10% and reduce
waste by 20% and increase recycling by 10%. Center Parcs is committed to achieving net zero by 2050 for its scope
1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the legally binding commitments made by the UK government and
similar commitments in the EU. Over the coming years, Center Parcs will develop a Net Zero strategy outlining the
route to achieving this. Center Parcs will also calculate its Scope 3 emissions and determine a potential carbon
reduction trajectory for these.

Center Parcs is subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to its relationship with its employees,
including minimum wage requirements, child labour laws, health benefits, and overtime and working condition
requirements. In addition, Center Parcs is subject to the Equality Act 2010.

Center Parcs was the first UK organisation to receive the Wildlife Trust’s “Biodiversity Benchmark” across
all of its sites, with all of the villages retaining their certification as of October 2018.

(“GPP”), a personal pension plan open to all employees and in which employees are automatically enrolled; and
(b) the Center Parcs Senior Pension Scheme (“FS **Scheme”), a closed occupational final salary (defined benefit)**

committee and other selected senior managers and meets quarterly to evaluate risks that have occurred, new and

Committee. Center Parcs’ Data Protection Governance Committee meets six-monthly to consider and review data
protection risks and issues, including significant new projects or data breaches, and is chaired by the HR and
Commercial Services Director.

Center Parcs has a team of internal auditors based across all five villages that operates independently from
village operations. The audit team looks at trends across the business to ensure that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements. Before the commencement of each financial year, the
directors and senior management are consulted to prepare an audit plan for the year, highlighting areas that raise
concern. Audits are then performed at each village by the team of internal auditors and the resulting report is circulated
to the directors. Recommendations arising from the reports are discussed with the relevant management personnel to
ensure that controls are improved in a manner that results in efficient and secure procedures.

**Management Employment Contracts**

All members of the Operating Board have permanent employment contracts of indefinite terms, terminable
on 12 months’ notice by the employer and 6 months’ notice by the relevant employee. The contracts include a standard

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Longford Management Services Agreement**

CP Opco, Center Parcs Ireland Limited (“CP Ireland”) and Barclays Bank PLC entered into a management
services agreement on 1 December 2017 (the “Existing Management Services Agreement”). The Existing
Management Services Agreement was replaced by a new management services agreement between CP Opco, CP
Ireland and Situs Asset Management (Ireland) Designated Activity Company (as the sixth site funders facility agent
(the “Agent”)) dated 21 July 2023 (the “Longford Management Services Agreement”) pursuant to which CP Opco
continues to provide certain operating services and development management services in relation to the sixth Center
Parcs village opened at Newcastle, Ballymahon, County Longford, Ireland (the “Longford Forest”), in return for the
payment of on-going charges of £10,000 per annum in respect of ongoing operating services (such per annum amount
to be invoiced by CP Opco annually in arrears). CP Opco will be required to provide or procure a broad range of
services, including: human resources support; sales and marketing services; guest services; pricing and accounts; using
all reasonable endeavours to procure insurance in the name of CP Ireland; legal, compliance and company secretarial
support; central purchasing and liaison with suppliers; health and safety advice; procurement and management of IT
services; vehicle fleet management; site maintenance services; management of concessions and licensed units; internal
audit services; services in respect of the preparation of management accounts and statutory accounts; tax; strategic
support; any other services provided by CP Opco to the existing villages; and, ; and, in connection with the proposed

buildings and associated infrastructure work, advice in relation to tender processes for the building of infrastructure;
using all reasonable endeavours to obtain required licences and consents; appointment of consultants; liaising with
external counsel and negotiation with contractors; management of the construction programme; using all reasonable
endeavours to monitor building contracts; and arranging appropriate financing arrangements. CP Opco is required to
provide the operating services and the development management services to at least the same overall standard, scope
and quality as are provided to the existing villages.

CP Opco also grants CP Ireland a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable and perpetual
licence to use and reproduce any brands or trademarks owned or licensed by CP Opco and used by any of the existing
villages (including the core “Center Parcs” brand and trademarks) for the purposes of running the business of Longford
Forest which is described in further detail below. This IP licence is terminable only in certain limited circumstances
as described below.

The Longford Management Services Agreement, but not the licence of the intellectual property rights, may
be terminated in the following circumstances: (i) if CP Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates, by either CP Opco
or CP Ireland providing two years’ written notice, provided that the Agent may terminate the agreement at any time
during the two year notice period on not less than 20 Business Days’ written notice to CP Opco and CP Ireland; and
(ii) by either CP Opco or CP Ireland for non-payment, subject to an aggregate grace period for payment of 15 days. If
CP Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates, CP Opco may terminate, after consultation with the Agent (acting
reasonably and in good faith) for a period of not less than 3 months, the Longford Management Services Agreement
and the licence of the intellectual property rights by written notice if CP Ireland does or omits to do anything which
causes a material adverse effect to the value of the core “Center Parcs” brand and trademarks (taken as a whole). In
addition, if CP Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates: (i) CP Ireland may terminate the licence of the intellectual
property rights only by written notice effective on the earlier of (A) the date falling 2 years after the termination notice
is served by CP Ireland; and (B) the date that CP Opco ceases to provide the services to CP Ireland; and (ii) CP Opco
may terminate the licence of the intellectual property rights only by three months’ written notice if CP Ireland ceases
to brand Longford Forest as a “Center Parcs” site. CP Ireland may terminate the Longford Management Services
Agreement by written notice to CP Opco if: (i) the Agent has provided written consent that it can do so; and (ii) either,
CP Opco does not comply with the terms of the Longford Management Services Agreement and such breach has or
is likely to have a material adverse effect (subject to a 20 Business Day remedy period) or a declared default under
the CP Ireland facility agreement has occurred. The licence of CP Opco’s intellectual property rights (excluding the
marks referred to below) is a royalty free, non-exclusive and non-transferable (subject to the terms of the Longford
Management Services Agreement) licence whereas the licence of the trademarks (which includes the core Center
Parcs brand and trademarks, and any other brands or trademarks owned or licensed by CP Opco and used by any of
the existing villages) is a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable (subject to the terms of the Longford
Management Services Agreement) and (unless terminated in accordance with the Longford Management Services
Agreement) irrevocable and perpetual licence.

135


-----

Where a notice of termination has been served by CP Opco due to CP Ireland doing or omitting to do anything
which causes a material adverse effect on the value of the core “Center Parcs” brand and trademarks (taken as a whole)
the licence of the intellectual property rights will, subject to the consultation period described above, terminate on the
date on which CP Ireland receives the written notice of termination whereas, in respect of the other provisions of the
Longford Management Services Agreement, CP Opco shall provide exit services to CP Ireland for a period of 12
months from the date of the written notice of termination. If CP Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates and either
CP Opco or CP Ireland provides two years’ written notice to the other to terminate, CP Opco shall provide exit services
to CP Ireland for six months prior to the end of the two-year notice period. Such exit services include the handover of
data (to the extent permitted by law) required to honour future bookings of Longford Forest and market to past and
existing guests of Longford Forest and assistance with the handover or replacement of third-party supplier contracts,
shared IT services and equipment, payroll and HR systems, and the phasing out of the use of CP Opco’s intellectual
property rights. At any time when exit services are provided, CP Opco and CP Ireland will not be affiliates and the
termination events which lead to CP Opco being required to provide exit services only apply once CP Opco and CP
Ireland cease to be affiliates. Should CP Ireland and CP Opco cease to be affiliates as a result of a declared default
under the CP Ireland facility agreement, on and from the date falling 12 months after CP Ireland ceases to be an
affiliate, the ongoing charges will be increased to an amount which is equal to three per cent. of the gross revenue
generated from accommodation bookings in respect of the Longford Forest village for each completed quarterly
accounting period on and from the relevant date until the date that the Longford Management Services Agreement
terminates (invoiced quarterly in arrears).

The liability of CP Opco to CP Ireland whether arising from negligence, breach of contract or otherwise shall
not exceed an aggregate cap of £15 million. CP Opco may also be liable to CP Ireland where it causes damage to any
physical property up to an aggregate cap of £10 million provided that CP Ireland must first recover any loss for damage
to physical property from insurance proceeds. Neither CP Opco nor CP Ireland limits its liability for fraud, death or
personal injury arising from its negligence or that of its employees, agents or subcontractors. Neither CP Opco nor CP
Ireland shall be liable to each other for: (i) loss of profits, revenues or contracts, business interruption, or loss or
corruption of data; or (ii) indirect, special or consequential loss or damage, even if such loss was reasonably
foreseeable and whether arising from negligence, breach of contract or otherwise.

**Intercompany Account Agreement**

On 10 July 2020, CP Opco entered into the Intercompany Account Agreement with BSREP II Center Parcs
Jersey Limited (the **_Lender) pursuant to which the Lender has made available an intercompany account of up to_**
£90,925,000 (the Intercompany Account) (or its equivalent in any other currency acceptable to the Lender). CP Opco
has made a drawing of £70,000,000 under the Intercompany Account. No interest shall accrue on amounts advanced
under the Intercompany Account.

Amounts drawn under the Intercompany Account shall be repayable within one Business Day of demand by
the Lender subject to the satisfaction of the Class A Restricted Payment Condition under the Class A Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement. The liabilities of CP Opco under the Intercompany Account are subordinated pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement to the liabilities of the Obligors arising in respect of the Class A Loans and Class B Loans.

**Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement**

**_Repayments and Prepayments_**

The Class A4 Loan Expected Maturity Date is 22 August 2025 (the “Class A4 Loan Expected Maturity
**Date” or the “Class A4 EMD”), the Class A5 Loan Expected Maturity Date is 23 August 2028 (the “Class A5 Loan**
**Expected Maturity Date” or the “Class A5 EMD”), the Class A6 Loan Expected Maturity Date is 25 August 2027**
(the “Class A6 Loan Expected Maturity Date” or the “Class A6 EMD”), the Class A7 Loan Expected Maturity
Date is 25 August 2031 (the “Class A7 Loan Expected Maturity Date” or the “Class A7 EMD”). The Borrower
must repay the Class A4 Loans in full on 25 February 2042 and each of the Class A5 Loan, the Class A6 Loan and
the Class A7 Loan in full on 25 February 2047, to the extent not repaid, prepaid or otherwise discharged in full prior
to that date.

In certain circumstances the Borrowers will be required to prepay the Class A Loans in full, including if it
has become unlawful for the Issuer or the Borrower to perform any of their respective obligations under the relevant
documents or if a Borrower is, or will be, required to pay to the Issuer a tax payment as a result of a change in law or
in any published practice or concession of any relevant tax authority.

In addition, the Borrowers may, by giving the relevant notice to the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee,
voluntarily prepay (or ensure that a Borrower prepays) all or part (if applicable) of any outstanding Class A Loan
provided that certain conditions are satisfied.

**_Representations_**

The Class A IBLA has standard representations and warranties made by each Obligor. These representations
include (subject, in some cases, to agreed exceptions and qualifications as to materiality and reservations of law) the
following representations:

(a) its due incorporation, valid existence, power and authority to own its assets and carry on its business
as it is being conducted;

(b) it has the power to enter into and perform the senior finance documents;

139


-----

(c) it has not breached any judgment, law, regulation, order or decree applicable to it;

(d) its obligations under the senior finance documents are legal, valid, binding and enforceable;

(e) no default or termination event is outstanding;

(f) no litigation, arbitration or administrative proceedings against any member of the Obligor Group
has been started or, to its knowledge, threatened;

to use, the assets necessary for it to carry on its business as presently conducted at each of the
properties except for non-material defects;

(h) no insolvency event has occurred and is continuing in relation to it;

(i) there are no agreements, arrangements or resolutions with any of its affiliates which: (i) call for a
further issue or allotment of any share or loan note (or any equivalent by), or for the benefit of, an
Obligor; or (ii) allow any other person to directly participate in the Obligor Group’s profits;

(k) no contingent liabilities or commitments not disclosed in relevant financial statements;

(l) matters relating to centre of main interest;

**_Security_**

The obligations of the Obligors under the Class A IBLA are secured by the Obligors in favour of HSBC
Corporate Trustee Company (UK) Limited (the “Borrower Security Trustee”) for the benefit of the borrower secured
creditors by way of fixed and floating charges created by a borrower deed of charge (the “Borrower Deed of Charge”)
and by a deed of charge entered into by CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited (the “Woburn Deed of Charge”,
and together with the Borrower Deed of Charge, the “Class A Borrower Deed of Charge”). The security from each
of the Obligors include first-ranking mortgages or first fixed charges over their freehold and leasehold interests in the
villages, their bank accounts and the share capital of their subsidiaries.

**_Financial Covenants_**

In addition to the general covenants described below, the Class A IBLA contains a financial covenant that
requires the Borrowers to maintain a ratio (expressed as a percentage) of free cash flow to class A total debt service
charges (the “Class A FCF DSCR”) equal to or greater than 110% on each Financial Covenant Test Date. The
Borrowers will have the benefit of certain cure rights in the event that the Class A FCF DSCR is less than 110%.

If on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the Obligors fail to pay the full amount due on such date in respect of
the Class B Loans, the waivers and/or amendments in respect of the Class A FCF DSCR covenant will cease to have
any effect, with effect from the day immediately preceding the Financial Covenant Test Date occurring prior to such
Loan Interest Payment Date.

**_Class A Restricted Payments_**

The Class A IBLA prohibits any Obligor from, at any time, making any payment of dividend, or other
distribution in respect of shares, or any redemption in respect of share capital, or any repayment of principal or
payment of interest in respect of any financial indebtedness owed by an Obligor to an entity that is not an Obligor, or
granting a loan in cash or in kind, or any purchase of any debt owed by an Obligor to an entity which is not an Obligor
(such restricted payment a “Class A Restricted Payment”) to any entity that is an affiliate of the Borrower group but
not an Obligor at any time unless the Class A Restricted Payment Condition (as defined below) was satisfied as at the
most recent date which is seven Business Days before each loan interest payment date (the “Financial Covenant Test
**Date”).**

In addition, the Borrowers must not make any payment in respect of the Class B Loans or purchase any Class
B Notes if the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is not then satisfied, unless such payment is made using new
equity funds of any Borrower received for this purpose.

140


-----

For these purposes:

The “Class A Restricted Payment Condition” is the condition which will be satisfied if:

(i) as at the most recent Financial Covenant Test Date, the Class A FCF DSCR calculated as
at such Financial Covenant Test Date is greater than or equal to 135%;

(ii) on the payment date of any Class A Restricted Payment, either (i) there is no drawing
outstanding (other than a Standby Drawing (as defined below)) under the Liquidity Facility
Agreement; or (ii) if applicable, the Liquidity Reserve remains fully funded;

Test Date;

(iv) on the payment date of any Class A Restricted Payment, no event of default or potential
event of default under the Class A Notes is continuing; and

(v) on the payment date of any Class A Restricted Payment, the amount available under the
liquidity facility pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement or (as applicable) the
Liquidity Reserve is not less than the lesser of (i) £110 million; and (ii) 24 months’ peak
debt service on the Class A Notes.

**_Original Class B Notes_**

The Issuer issued £280,000,000 11.625% Class B Fixed Rate Notes due 2042 (the “Original Class B Notes”)
on the Closing Date. On the Closing Date, the Issuer, the Original Borrowers, the Guarantors and the Borrower
Security Trustee, among others, entered into a junior loan agreement (the “Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
**Agreement”). Pursuant to the Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer made available to the**

143


-----

Original Borrowers a subordinated secured facility in an aggregate principal amount of £280.0 million (the advance
thereunder, the “Original Class B Loan”). The Original Class B Loan and the Original Class B Notes were refinanced
in full (together with accrued interest and any Class B make-whole payment due in respect of the Original Class B
Notes) by using the proceeds from the issuance of the Class B2 Notes (described below).

**_Class B2 Notes_**

The Issuer issued the Class B2 Notes on the Third Closing Date.

On the Third Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Class B2 Notes were applied by the Issuer to
make advances to the Third Initial Borrowers pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of £560.0 million. Pursuant to the Second
Amended and Restated Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer provided to the Third Initial Borrowers
a secured facility (the “Class B2 Loan”) which was contractually subordinated in terms of payments and security to
the Class A Loans (other than the Topco Share Security).

The Center Parcs Group refinanced the Class B2 Loan and the Issuer redeemed the Class B2 Notes on the
Fourth Closing Date using the proceeds from the issuance of the Further Class A4 Notes, the Class B3 Notes and the
Class B4 Notes.

**_Class B3 Notes and Class B4 Notes_**

The Issuer issued the Class B3 Notes and the Class B4 Notes on the Fourth Closing Date. On the Fourth
Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Class B3 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make advances to the Third
Initial Borrowers pursuant to a secured facility (the “Class B3 Facility”) under the Third Amended and Restated Class
B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of £480.0 million (“the Class B3 Loan”) and
the proceeds of the issue of the Class B4 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make advances to the Third Initial
Borrowers pursuant to a secured facility (the “Class B4 Facility”) under the Third Amended and Restated Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of £250.0 million.

The Issuer redeemed the Class B3 Notes in part on the Sixth Closing Date using the proceeds from the
issuance of the Class B5 Notes and the remainder of the Class B3 Notes were redeemed in full on the Seventh Closing
Date using the proceeds from the issuance of the Class B6 Notes. The issuer intends to redeem the Class B4 Notes in
full using the proceeds of the Notes offered hereby.

**_Class B5 Notes and Class B6 Notes_**

Pursuant to the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer provided to the Third Initial
Borrowers secured facilities in an aggregate principal amount of £250.0 million with the proceeds of the issue of the
Class B5 Notes (the “Class B5 Facility” and the advance thereunder, the “Class B5 Loan”) on the Sixth Closing
Date, and in an aggregate principal amount of £255.0 million with the proceeds of the issue of the Class B6 Notes on
the Seventh Closing Date (the “Class B6 Facility” and the advance thereunder, the “Class B6 LoanError! Bookmark
not defined.” and together with the Class B5 Loan and the Class B7 Loan, collectively, the “Class B **Loans”) each of**
which is, or will be, contractually subordinated to the Class A Facilities pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Third Initial Borrowers must repay the Class B5 Loan in full on the Loan Interest Payment Date in
August 2050 (the “Class B5 Loan Final Maturity Date”) to the extent not repaid, prepaid or otherwise discharged
in full prior to that date. The Third Initial Borrowers must repay the Class B6 Loan in full on the Loan Interest Payment
Date in August 2051 (the “Class B6 Loan Final Maturity Date”) to the extent not repaid, prepaid or otherwise
discharged in full prior to that date.

The Class B5 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full on 28 August 2026 (the “Class B5 Note Expected
**Maturity Date”). The Class B6 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full on 28 August 2027 (the “Class B6 Note**
**Expected Maturity Date”).**

The Class B5 Notes accrue interest at the rate of 6.500% per annum from (and including) the Sixth Closing
Date up to (but excluding) 28 August 2026 and, thereafter, 6.500% per annum. The Class B6 Notes accrue interest at
the rate of 4.500% per annum from (and including) the Seventh Closing Date up to (but excluding) 28 August 2027
and, thereafter, 4.500% per annum.

144


-----

The Class B5 Loan is expected to be redeemed in full by 25 August 2026 (the “Class B5 Loan Expected
**Maturity Date”). The Class B6 Loan is expected to be redeemed in full by 25 August 2027 (the “Class B6 Loan**
**Expected Maturity Date” and together with the Class B4 Loan Expected Maturity Date, Class B5 Loan Expected**
Maturity Date, and Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date, each a “Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date”). If, on
the relevant Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date, the relevant Class B Loan remains outstanding, the relevant Class
B Noteholders can enforce their rights under the Topco Share Security Agreement and the CP Cayman Security
Agreement, each as described in more detail below.

In respect of the Class B5 Notes, from (and including) 28 August 2026, the Issuer will not make payments
of interest in respect of the Class B5 Notes. Instead, interest will accrue on the Class B5 Notes at the applicable rate
(as set out above) but will be deferred and will be payable only on the earlier of (a) the date on which the Class A
Notes are repaid in full and (b) 28 August 2050. Interest will accrue on such deferred interest at the rate otherwise
payable on unpaid principal of the Class B5 Notes at such time.

In respect of the Class B6 Notes, from (and including) 28 August 2027, the Issuer will not make payments
of interest in respect of the Class B6 Notes. Instead, interest will accrue on the Class B6 Notes at the applicable rate
(as set out above) but will be deferred and will be payable only on the earlier of (a) the date on which the Class A
Notes are repaid in full and (b) 28 August 2051. Interest will accrue on such deferred interest at the rate otherwise
payable on unpaid principal of the Class B6 Notes at such time.

The economic terms and conditions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (including, among other
things, in relation to the payment of interest and the repayment and prepayment of principal) are broadly similar to
the terms and conditions of the Class B Notes.

In respect of the Class B5 Loan, the Third Initial Borrowers may prepay all or a part of the Class B5 Facility
at a specified prepayment price (expressed as a percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, on the Class B5 Facility prepaid, to the applicable date of prepayment. Upon the occurrence
of certain changes in tax law, the Third Initial Borrowers may prepay all of the Class B5 Facility at a price equal to
the principal amount prepaid plus accrued and unpaid interest.

In respect of the Class B6 Loan, the Third Initial Borrowers may prepay all or a part of the Class B6 Facility
at a specified prepayment price (expressed as a percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, on the Class B6 Facility prepaid, to the applicable date of prepayment. Upon the occurrence
of certain changes in tax law, the Third Initial Borrowers may prepay all of the Class B6 Facility at a price equal to
the principal amount prepaid plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Upon certain events constituting a change of control, the Borrowers may be required to make an offer to
repurchase all the Class B5 Notes and the Class B6 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, up to the purchase date.

Under the Class B IBLA, the Obligors are required to give certain representations and become subject to
certain covenants in respect of the Class B5 Loan and the Class B6 Loan, which are substantially the same as those in
respect of the Class B7 Loan and described in more detail in the section entitled “Description of the Class B7 Loan”.

**Share Enforcement Event**

No event of default may occur with respect to the Class B Notes or Class B Loans while the Class A Loans
or Class A Notes are still outstanding (until after an acceleration of the Class A Notes or Class A Loans, respectively).
However, upon the occurrence of any event that would otherwise constitute an event of default (each, a “Share
**Enforcement Event”), the Class B Noteholders have the ability to demand repayment by Topco pursuant to the Topco**
Undertaking and direct the security trustee to enforce the security granted pursuant to the Topco Security Documents.
The events that could lead to such a Share Enforcement Event or, in certain cases, an event of default, are customary
for high yield debt instruments and subject to customary grace periods. See “Description of the Class B7 Loan” for a
further description of the Share Enforcement Events.

If at any time no Class A Loans or Additional Class A Loans remain outstanding, or an acceleration of the
Class A Loan has occurred, any such Share Enforcement Event will also constitute a Class B Loan Event of Default.

145


-----

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Class B Notes and any non-contractual obligations arising
out of or in connection with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Class B Notes are governed by
English law.

**Borrower Security Documents**

The obligations in respect of the Class B5 Loan and the Class B6 Loan benefit from the security described
in the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements – Borrower Security Documents”

**Liquidity Facility Agreement**

On the Second Issue Date, the Issuer entered into the Liquidity Facility Agreement with, among others,
Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, the Liquidity Facility Agent, the Cash Manager and the
Issuer Security Trustee, pursuant to which Barclays Bank PLC and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch agreed to
make a liquidity facility (the “Liquidity Facility”) available to meet certain liquidity shortfalls. On the Fourth Closing
Date, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch transferred its commitment under the Liquidity Facility to NatWest Markets
Plc and the Liquidity Facility Agreement was amended. The Liquidity Facility Agreement was amended and restated
on the Fifth Closing Date and on 28 May 2019, NatWest Markets Plc transferred its commitments under the Liquidity
Facility to HSBC UK Bank Plc. The Liquidity Facility Agreement was amended and restated on 24 May 2021 and on
the Eighth Closing Date, the Liquidity Facility Agreement was further amended and restated to reflect an increase in
the aggregate commitments available from £90 million to £110 million, to be on the terms described below. References
to “Liquidity Facility Providers” below shall be to Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”) and HSBC UK Bank Plc
(“HSBC”).

Under the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Liquidity Facility Providers will provide 364-day
commitments in an aggregate amount equal to £110 million, with Barclays providing aggregate commitments of £55
million and HSBC providing aggregate commitments of £55 million, to permit drawings to be made be made by the
Issuer to enable the Issuer to service interest due on the Class A Notes, together with certain senior ranking expenses
owed to other transaction parties, in the event of there being insufficient cash flow received from the Obligors under
the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

The Liquidity Facility Agreement provides that the amounts drawn by the Issuer (such amounts, a “Liquidity
**Loan Drawing”) and repaid to the Liquidity Facility Providers may be redrawn.**

Each Liquidity Facility Provider must be a bank, the long term unsecured, unsubordinated and unguaranteed
long term obligations of which must be rated, in the case of S&P BBB and, in the case of Fitch, BBB (or, in each case,
such other lower rating which is consistent with the published criteria (relevant for the applicable counterparty) of the
relevant Rating Agency) (the “Requisite Rating”).

The Liquidity Facility Agreement provides that: if (i) at any time the relevant rating of a Liquidity Facility
Provider falls below the Requisite Rating; or (ii) a Liquidity Facility Provider does not agree to renew such Liquidity
Facility prior to the expiry of the 364 day period, the Issuer shall, if it is unable to enter into a substitute liquidity
facility in accordance with the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement, draw the available commitment of such
Liquidity Facility Provider and place the same on deposit (such drawing, a “Standby Drawing” and, together with a
Liquidity Loan Drawing, a “Drawing”) in the relevant Liquidity Standby Account. The Issuer may only withdraw
amounts from such Liquidity Standby Account to enable the Issuer to service interest due on the Class A Notes,
together with certain senior ranking expenses owed to other transaction parties, in the event of there being insufficient
cash flow received from the Obligors under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

In addition, in the event that a Standby Drawing was made following the downgrade of a Liquidity Facility
Provider, the Issuer will use its reasonable endeavours to help such Liquidity Facility Provider to find a suitable
replacement Liquidity Facility Provider or guarantor (as applicable) with the Requisite Rating.

Interest accrues on any Drawing made under the Liquidity Facility (including any Standby Drawing) at a rate
equal to the Compounded Reference Rate (being the aggregate of SONIA and a 0.2766 per cent. per annum credit
adjustment spread) plus a margin (equal to 1.50% per annum, in relation to a Liquidity Loan Drawing, and equal to
1.50% per annum, in relation to a Standby Drawing) (together with certain mandatory costs). Under the terms of the
Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Issuer is also required to pay additional amounts if: (i) a withholding or deduction
for or on account of tax is imposed on payments required to be made to any Liquidity Facility Provider; or (ii) any
Liquidity Facility Provider suffers an increase in the cost of providing its Commitment under the Liquidity Facility.

146


-----

From the Year 5 Step-Up Date the rate of interest applicable to any Drawing made in respect of the Liquidity Facility
Agreement will increase, every six months, on a cumulative basis by the Year 5 Step-Up Margin up to a maximum of
5% per annum.

For these purposes:

“Year 5 Step-Up Date” means the Note Interest Payment Date next following 24 May 2026.

“Year 5 Step-Up Margin” means 0.50% per annum, increasing by 0.50% on each Note Interest Payment
Date following the Year 5 Step-Up Date up to a maximum of 5.00% per annum.

Payments due under the Liquidity Facility will rank senior to interest and principal payments on the Class A
Notes and the Class B Notes, and after certain third party costs and expenses other than in relation to Liquidity
Subordinated Amounts which rank junior to interest and principal payments on the Class A Notes and the Class B
Notes. The Liquidity Facility Providers will not be permitted to enforce the security granted by the Obligors under the
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements.

For these purposes:

“Liquidity Subordinated Amounts” means all amounts payable under, or in any way in connection with,
the Liquidity Facility Agreement, other than:

(a) principal and interest in respect of any Drawing made under the Liquidity Facility Agreement,
except that:

(i) part of the interest (for the relevant interest period) on such Drawing which represents a
mandatory cost in excess of 0.20% per annum on the maximum amount drawn under the
Liquidity Facility Agreement from time to time; and

(ii) in respect of a Drawing made on or after the Year 5 Step-Up Date, the Year 5 Step-Up
Margin;

(b) the commitment fee payable under the Liquidity Facility Agreement;

(c) any costs payable by the Issuer to an LF Finance Party under the Liquidity Facility Agreement as a
result of any increased costs of such LF Finance Party, including those arising from:

(i) the introduction of, or any change in, or any change in the interpretation, administration or
application of, any law or regulation; or

(ii) compliance with any law or regulation made after the date of the Liquidity Facility
Agreement.

In the event that the Issuer is unable to make any payment of amounts due pursuant to the Liquidity Facility
Agreement, such amounts will accrue default interest at a rate of 1% per annum higher than the rate which would have
been otherwise payable, up to but excluding the date of actual payment.

_Governing Law_

The Liquidity Facility Agreement is governed by English law.

**Intercompany Account Agreement**

Borrower Deed of Charge, such person or persons (including an officer or officers of the Borrower
Security Trustee) as the Borrower Security Trustee considers appropriate to be a Receiver of such
Obligor and, in the case of the appointment of more than one person, to act together or independently
of the other or others.

(b) If any Obligor becomes aware of any application for the appointment of an administrator of the
Issuer, a notice of intention to appoint an administrator of any Obligor or documents to be, or
actually filed with, a competent court or registrar for the administration of the Issuer, then it will
immediately inform the Issuer Security Trustee in writing of such application, notice or filing, and

to oppose the application or make such submissions in respect of the application as the Borrower

Receiver unless it is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. If the Borrower Security Trustee
is required to appoint a Receiver pursuant to paragraph 26.5 (Appointment of Receiver to block an
_administrator — Obligor level), the Borrower Security Trustee will agree that notwithstanding any_
other term of the ICA or any other Borrower Transaction Document, it is adequately indemnified
and secured to its satisfaction in respect of such appointment by virtue of its rights under the ICA
and the security that it has in respect of such rights.

the circumstances referred to in paragraph 26.5 (Appointment of Receiver to block an administrator
_— Obligor level), it waives any claim against the Borrower Security Trustee in respect of such_
appointment.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt:

(i) nothing in paragraph 26.5 (Appointment of Receiver to block an administrator — Obligor
level) or paragraph 26.6 (Indemnity is adequate — Obligor level) shall be construed so as
to impose on the Borrower Security Trustee any obligation to indemnify any administrative
receiver appointed by it pursuant to paragraph 26.5 (Appointment of Receiver to block an
administrator — Obligor level) except to the extent of (and from) the cash and assets
comprising the Borrower Secured Property held by the Borrower Security Trustee at such
time; and

endeavours, it is unable to find a person who is willing to be appointed as an administrative
receiver on the terms as to indemnification referred to in paragraph 26.6(c)(i) above.

The Issuer and Obligors will waive any claim against the Borrower Security Trustee in respect of any
appointment made pursuant to the provisions described in this sub-clause (c).

**27.** **Enforcement Action if Class B Notes Outstanding**

27.1 **Introduction**

The ICA will provide that the exercise and enforcement of rights by the Instructing Group in respect of the
Borrower Security that has become enforceable is in certain circumstances subject to the provision of a
Fairness Opinion to the Class B Note Trustee (for the benefit of itself and the Class B Noteholders).

27.2 **Requirement for a Fairness Opinion**

If:

(a) there are any Class B Notes outstanding;

(b) the Borrower Security has become enforceable; and

(c) the Class A Instructing Group have instructed the Issuer Security Trustee to require the Borrower
Security Trustee to deliver a Class A Loan Enforcement Notice,

then, subject to paragraph 27.3 (Borrower Security Trustee may dispose under a Sales Process), the
Borrower Security Trustee will (or will procure that any agent, receiver or delegate appointed to act
on behalf of the Borrower Security Trustee pursuant to this Agreement will) comply with the
following conditions:

(i) before any disposal of any Borrower Secured Property of a value more than £10 million
the Borrower Security Trustee will procure the provision to the Class B Note Trustee (for
the benefit of itself and the Class B Noteholders), of a Fairness Opinion (having asked at
least three potential Financial Advisers for a quote in respect of the costs for the provision
thereof);

(ii) such Fairness Opinion must be delivered to the Class B Note Trustee at least two weeks
before the proposed disposal;

(iii) subject to and in accordance with paragraph 30.3 (Appointment of Receiver to block an
_administrator — Issuer level), the Borrower Security Trustee will be responsible for_
commissioning any Fairness Opinion;

(iv) neither the Class B Note Trustee nor any Class B Noteholder will be entitled to raise any
objections to any Fairness Opinion delivered by the Borrower Security Trustee in
accordance with paragraph (ii); and

(v) the cost of commissioning any Fairness Opinion will be for the account of the Borrower
Security Trustee provided always that the Borrower Security Trustee is prefunded to an
amount equal to the cost of such Fairness Opinion as an expense of the enforcement process
except that if the cost is more than £500,000 (excluding VAT), then:

209


-----

(A) the excess cost will be for the account of the Class B Noteholders, provided that:

(I) where one of the potential Financial Advisers offered to produce a
Fairness Opinion for less than £500,000 (excluding VAT) but the Class
A Noteholders directed the Borrower Security Trustee to select another
provider whose fees for providing the opinion are in excess of £500,000,
all such fees will be for the account of the enforcement process generally
(and not specifically for the account of the Class B Noteholders); and

(II) if more than one potential Financial Adviser provides a quote and all the
quotes provided are in excess of £500,000, the Class B Noteholders will
be required to pay for all fees in excess of £500,000 save where the Class
A Noteholders select a Financial Adviser which has provided a quote
which is higher than another quote provided; and

(B) the Borrower Security Trustee will not be obliged to commission any Fairness
Opinion unless:

(I) it is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction and/or prefunded;
and/or

(II) receives an undertaking from the Class B Noteholders that the Class B
Noteholders will indemnify, secure and/or pre-fund the Borrower
Security Trustee for any excess costs in relation to commissioning any
Fairness Opinion, if applicable.

27.3 **Borrower Security Trustee may dispose under a Sales Process**

If the Borrower Security Trustee:

(a) is unable to appoint a Financial Adviser when requested or unable to obtain a Fairness Opinion; or

(b) is notified in writing by the Class B Note Trustee on behalf of the Class B Noteholders that the Class
B Noteholders do not require the procurement of a Fairness Opinion; or

(c) intends to dispose of the assets for a value that is less than the proposed consideration specified in
respect of such assets in a Fairness Opinion, then:

(i) subject to applicable law, the Borrower Security Trustee or any Receiver will only dispose
of relevant assets through a competitive marketing and sales process typical for such type
of assets with a view to obtaining a fair market consideration for such assets under the then
prevailing market conditions (“Sales Process”) and will be entitled to appoint any
investment bank, accounting firm or any other third party professional organisation of
international standing engaged in the marketing and sale of businesses and assets, to advise
the Borrower Security Trustee or the Receiver in relation to such disposal; and

(ii) the Borrower Security Trustee or any Receiver will be entitled to dispose of the assets
under and in accordance with the Sales Process (including, at a value less than that stated
in any Fairness Opinion), provided that if there is more than one party willing to acquire
the assets, then the Borrower Security Trustee or the Receiver will be required to accept
the highest executable offer.

27.4 **Fairness Opinion only required if Class A Notes are outstanding**

Except as set out in paragraph 27.2 (Requirement for a Fairness Opinion), in no other circumstances will a
Fairness Opinion be required prior to the disposal of any Borrower Secured Property.

27.5 **Class A Instructing Group may provide Directions to appoint Financial Adviser**

The Class A Instructing Group may provide any Direction to Issuer Security Trustee to require the Borrower
Security Trustee to appoint any Financial Adviser and the Borrower Security Trustee will act in accordance
with any such Direction.

(a) Further to paragraph 27.5 (Class A Instructing Group may provide Directions to appoint Financial
_Adviser), the Borrower Security Trustee will be entitled to seek any Direction from the Issuer_
Security Trustee in relation to any matter concerning the commissioning of a Fairness Opinion or
otherwise, the enforcement of the Borrower Security and the Borrower Security Trustee will be
required to follow any Direction given by the Issuer Security Trustee.

(b) The Issuer Security Trustee will be entitled to seek any Direction from the Class A Instructing Group
in relation to any request for any Direction made by the Borrower Security Trustee pursuant to
paragraph (a) above, concerning the commissioning of a Fairness Opinion or otherwise the
enforcement of the Borrower Security and the Issuer Security Trustee will be required to follow any
Direction given to it by the Class A Instructing Group.

the Issuer Security Trustee shall give such instruction to the Borrower Security Trustee if the Issuer Security
Trustee is directed to do so by the relevant Instructing Group, pursuant to paragraph 26.3 (Loan Enforcement
_Instruction Notices) (and as further specified in paragraphs 26.4(c) and 26.4(d) (Instructions prior to the_
_Class A Discharge Date)) and the indemnity requirements set out in paragraph 26.12 (Indemnity required —_
_Obligor level) have been satisfied, and unless and until so instructed and indemnified, the Borrower Security_
Trustee will be under no obligation to and will not deliver a Loan Acceleration Notice.

28.2 **Consequences of delivery of Loan Acceleration Notice**

(a) Upon the delivery of a Loan Acceleration Notice, all outstanding amounts under the Class A IBLA
and/or Class B IBLA as applicable will be declared immediately due and payable.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of the ICA or any other Transaction Document, if a Loan

Borrower Secured Creditors may serve a notice or notices declaring any amount payable to a
Borrower Secured Creditor under a Borrower Transaction Document to be payable in advance of its
stated maturity or requiring the payment of any termination amount under a relevant Borrower
Transaction Document.

(c) The Borrower Security Trustee will deliver a copy of the Loan Acceleration Notice to:

(i) the Issuer Security Trustee;

provided that:

Rating Assessment given by any of them and relied upon by such Security Trustee, each Security Trustee
will be entitled, for the purposes of exercising any right, power, trust, authority, duty or discretion under or
in relation to the Transaction Documents to which it is a party or over which it has security:

(a) to have regard to any Rating Agency Confirmation or any Ratings Assessment if the Transaction
Documents require, or in any particular circumstance, where such Security Trustee considers, that

test to apply in that circumstance, in exercising any such power, trust, authority, duty or discretion
or, as the case may be, in giving the relevant consent; and

each Security Trustee will be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that:

(a) a Ratings Assessment is a point-in-time assessment which does not constitute a credit rating by
Fitch; will not be monitored by Fitch and therefore will not be updated to reflect changed
circumstances or information that may affect the Ratings Assessment; and does not address other
matters falling outside of the Relevant Disposal (as defined in the Class A IBLA) that may be of
relevance to the Noteholders;

(b) neither of the Security Trustees will have any right of recourse to or against Fitch in respect of a
Ratings Assessment which is relied upon by either Security Trustee; and

Trustees) or create any legal relations between Fitch and the Security Trustees or any other person
whether by way of contract or otherwise.

held by them. For the avoidance of doubt, payment by the Class B Noteholders to the Class A
Noteholders will not be made through the Principal Paying Agent.

Charge and the security which it has in respect of such rights.

232


-----

The Borrower Security Trustee holds the benefit of the security created in its favour pursuant to the Woburn
Deed of Charge on trust for the benefit of the Borrower Secured Creditors and subject to the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The circumstances which may lead to the security granted under the Woburn Deed of Charge being enforced
are set out in the section “—Intercreditor Agreement” above.

_Appointment of an administrative receiver — CP Woburn Opco_

The Woburn Deed of Charge contains provisions (provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement) that require
the Borrower Security Trustee to appoint an administrative receiver to block the appointment of an administrator on
the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement. See paragraph 26.5 (Appointment of
_Receiver to block an administrator — Obligor level) in “—Intercreditor Agreement” above._

The Borrower Security Trustee is not and will not be obliged to appoint an administrative receiver unless it
is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. However, the Woburn Deed of Charge provides that, in the event that
the Borrower Security Trustee is required to enforce the Borrower Security by appointing an administrative receiver
following receipt of actual notice of an application for the appointment of an administrator or actual notice of intention
to appoint an administrator, the Borrower Security Trustee has agreed that it is adequately indemnified and secured in
respect of such appointment by virtue of its rights against CP Woburn Opco under the Woburn Deed of Charge and
the security which it has in respect of such rights.

_Governing law_

The Woburn Deed of Charge and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are
governed by English law.

**Topco Payment Undertaking**

Pursuant to an amended and restated deed of undertaking to be entered into on the Ninth Closing Date, Topco
has undertaken to pay to the Issuer an amount equal to the aggregate of:

(a) the then principal balance of the Class B Loans;

(b) any accrued but unpaid interest outstanding in respect of the Class B Loans;

(c) any Additional Amounts; and

(d) all other amounts (including, without limitation, any premium and interest on overdue amounts)
outstanding under the Class B IBLA,

(together the “Class B Payment Amount”), on the earlier of (i) the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event
arising as a result of any amount (including without limitation, any principal amount or premium of a Class B Loan)
remaining outstanding (whether or not due and payable) under a Class B Loan as at the close of business on the Class
B Loan Expected Maturity Date of such Class B Loan and (ii) the date on which Topco receives a valid notice of
demand from the Borrower Security Trustee following the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event or Class B Loan
Event of Default.

Failure by Topco to pay such amount will give the right to the Borrower Security Trustee (on instruction
from the Class B Note Trustee or, as the case may be, the Class B Noteholders) to enforce the Topco Share Security
granted to the Borrower Security Trustee by Topco over the shares Topco holds in CP Cayman Limited and the share
security granted to the Borrower Security Trustee by CP Cayman Limited over the shares it holds in Center Parcs
(Holdings 1) Limited. The proceeds from the enforcement of this share pledge must be effected in the most tax efficient
manner at the relevant time as a subscription of shares in the Borrowers who then have to use the funds to prepay the
Class B Loans.

The Class B Payment Amount is also due if there is a Class B Loan Event of Default. The Borrowers will
then apply such amounts in payment and/or prepayment of amounts outstanding on the Class B IBLA.

The Issuer will apply all amounts received by it from the Borrowers or, as the case may be, Topco, in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. Topco will agree not to exercise any right of set-off or
counterclaim which it might have against the Issuer.

233


-----

The Topco Payment Undertaking and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it
are governed by English law.

**Topco Share Security Agreement**

Under a share security agreement (the “Topco Share Security Agreement”) entered into on the Third
Closing Date between Topco, the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer, Topco granted first-ranking security by
way of equitable mortgage and first fixed charge over the entire issued share capital of CP Cayman Limited and its
other assets, rights, and undertakings as security for the obligations of Topco under the Topco Payment Undertaking
(the “Topco Share Security”). In addition, Topco granted a first floating charge over all its property, assets and rights,
present and future, in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee as continuing security for full punctual payment of the
Class B Payment Amount and amounts payable to the Borrower Security Trustee under the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement, a Borrower Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Tax Deed of Covenant, or any
other related document designated in writing as such by the Issuer, the Borrower Security Trustee and the Borrowers.
The Issuer granted (in the Issuer Deed of Charge) security over its whole right, title, interest and benefit under the
Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco Share Security Agreement to the Issuer Security Trustee for the benefit

Under the CP Cayman Security Agreement, entered into on the Third Closing Date between CP Cayman
Limited, the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer (as supplemented by a supplemental security agreement entered
into on the Fourth Closing Date), CP Cayman Limited granted a first legal mortgage and first fixed charge over the
entire issued share capital of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and its other assets, rights, and undertakings as security
for all obligations and liabilities of Topco under the Topco Payment Undertaking. In addition, CP Cayman Limited
granted a first floating charge over all its property, assets and rights, present and future, in favour of the Borrower
Security Trustee as continuing security for all obligations and liabilities of Topco under the Topco Payment
Undertaking.

It is expected that CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited, CP Cayman Midco 2 Limited and CP Cayman Limited will
be migrated to Bermuda by way of a continuation under the provisions of the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda (the
“Bermuda Companies Act”). If the migration occurs, it is expected that: (i) CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited will change
its name to CP Bermuda Midco 1 Limited; CP Cayman Midco 2 Limited will change its name to CP Bermuda Midco
2 Limited; and (iii) CP Cayman Limited will change its name to CP Bermuda Limited. The Bermuda Companies Act
provides that, upon continuance of a foreign corporation as a Bermuda company under the Bermuda Companies Act,
(a) the property of the foreign corporation continues to be the property of the Bermuda company; (b) the Bermuda
company continues to be liable for the obligations of the foreign corporation; (c) any existing cause of action, claim
or liability to prosecution in respect of the foreign corporation is unaffected; (d) any civil, criminal or administrative
action or proceeding pending by or against the foreign corporation may be continued by or against the Bermuda
company; and (e) any conviction against, or any ruling, order or judgment in favour of or against the foreign
corporation may be enforced by or against the Bermuda company.

Accordingly, the Topco Payment Undertaking, Topco Share Security Agreement and CP Cayman Security
Agreement will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited, CP Cayman Midco 2
Limited and CP Cayman Limited’s proposed migration from the Cayman Islands to Bermuda.

144A under the Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one
or more global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons attached (the Class B Rule 144A Registered
**_Global Notes). Class B Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S will be_**
represented by a global note in fully registered form without interest coupons attached (the Class B Regulation S
**_Registered Global Note and, together with the Class B Rule 144A Registered Global Notes, the Class B Global Notes)._**
The Class B Global Note in respect of the Class B5 Notes has been deposited on behalf of the subscribers of the
relevant Class B Notes with, and registered in the name of a nominee for, a common depositary (the **_Common_**
**_Depositary) for Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (Clearstream, Luxembourg) and Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V._**
(Euroclear and, together with Clearstream, Luxembourg, the Clearing Systems) on the Sixth Closing Date. The Class
B Global Note in respect of the Class B6 Notes has been deposited on behalf of the subscribers of the relevant Class
B Notes with, and registered in the name of a nominee for, the Common Depositary for Clearstream, Luxembourg
and Euroclear on the Seventh Closing Date. The Class B Global Note in respect of the Class B7 Notes will be deposited

245


-----

Class B Global Notes, the Clearing Systems credited each subscriber of Class B Notes with the principal amount of
Notes of the relevant class equal to the aggregate principal amount thereof for which it had subscribed and paid.

1.2 For so long as the Class B Notes are represented by a Class B Global Note and the Clearing Systems so
permit, the Class B Notes will be tradeable only in the minimum authorised denomination of £100,000 and higher
integral multiples of £1,000.

1.3 The Class B Registrar shall maintain a register in respect of the Class B Notes (the Class B Register) outside
the United Kingdom which shall be the sole register in respect of the Class B Notes in accordance with the provisions
of the Agency Agreement and shall record in the Class B Register the names and addresses of the Holders of the Class
B Notes, particulars of the Class B Notes and all transfers and redemptions thereof.

1.4 Title to the Class B Notes will pass by and upon registration in the Class B Register. The Holder of each
Class B Note shall (except as otherwise required by a court of competent jurisdiction or applicable law) be treated as
the absolute owner of such Class B Note for all purposes.

1.5 Interests in a Class B Global Note will be transferable in accordance with the rules and procedures for the
time being of the relevant Clearing Systems and the regulations concerning the transfer of Class B Notes set out in the
Agency Agreement.

1.6 If, while any of the Class B Notes are represented by a Class B Global Note (a) the Issuer has been notified
that Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg have been closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days
(other than by reason of holiday, whether statutory or otherwise) or have announced an intention permanently to cease
business or have in fact done so and, in any such case, no successor clearing system satisfactory to the Class B Note
Trustee is available or (b) by reason of a change in Tax law (or the application or official interpretation thereof), which
change becomes effective on or after the Sixth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B5 Notes), the Seventh Closing
Date (in respect of the Class B6 Notes) or the Ninth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B7 Notes), the Issuer has or
will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would not be suffered were the Class B Notes in definitive
form and a certificate to such effect signed by two directors of the Issuer has been given to the Class B Note Trustee,
then the Issuer will issue Class B Notes of the relevant class in definitive form (Class B Definitive Notes) in exchange
for such Class B Global Note (free of charge to the persons entitled to them) within 30 days of the occurrence of the
relevant event. These Class B Conditions and the Transaction Documents will be amended in such manner as the Class
B Note Trustee and the Issuer Security Trustee may require to take account of the issue of Class B Definitive Notes.

1.7 Class B Definitive Notes, if issued, will only be printed and issued in denominations of £100,000 and integral
multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. Such Class B Notes will be serially numbered and will be issued in registered
form.

1.8 The Issuer may, from time to time, create and issue Class B Further Notes (in accordance with Condition
19.1 (Class B Further Notes and Class B New Notes)) having the same terms and conditions as the Class B Notes or
any sub-class thereof in all respects (or in all respects except for the first payment of interest). Such Class B Further
Notes shall be consolidated with the Class B Notes or sub-class thereof and form one series with all prior issues of the
relevant sub-class of Class B Notes. In addition, the Issuer may, from time to time, create and issue Class B New
Notes (in accordance with Condition 19.1 (Class B Further Notes and Class B New Notes)) having terms that differ
from the Class B5 Notes, the Class B6 Notes and the Class B7 Notes and do not form a single series with any of them.

1.9 Accordingly the Class B Notes or any sub-class thereof may comprise a number of issues in addition to the
initial issue of such Class B Notes.

conflict between the interests of any class of the Class B Noteholders and the holders of such Class
B Further Notes or Class B New Notes or of the other Issuer Secured Creditors);

new Transaction Documents entered into in connection with such Class B Further Notes or Class B New
Notes and the ranking thereof and of the claims of any party to any of such new Transaction Documents in
relation to each class of the Class B Notes.

Exchange Authority Limited to list the Class B Further Notes on the Official List of The International Stock
Exchange.

exercising any right, power, trust, authority, duty or discretion under or in relation to these Class B Conditions
or any of the Transaction Documents, that such exercise will not be materially prejudicial to the interests of
the Class B Noteholders (or any class thereof) if the Rating Agencies have provided a Rating Agency
Confirmation with respect thereto.

(f) The Class B Notes are solely the obligation of the Issuer and are not the obligation of, nor guaranteed by, any
of the Class B Note Trustee, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Issuer Account Bank, the Cash Manager, the
Class B Registrar, the Class B Transfer Agent or the Principal Paying Agent.

(g) Prior to the delivery of a Class B Note Acceleration Notice pursuant to Condition 9 (Class B Note Events of

at 4.500 % per annum (in each case, the applicable Class B6 Interest Rate). The Class B7 Notes bear interest
on their respective Principal Amount Outstanding (i) from (and including) the Ninth Closing Date until (but
excluding) the Class B7 Note Step-Down Date at   % per annum and (ii) from (and including) the Class B7
Note Step-Down Date to (and including) the Class B7 Note Final Maturity Date, at    % per annum (in
each case, the applicable Class B7 Interest Rate) and together with the Class B5 Interest Rate and the Class
B6 Interest Rate, the Class B Interest Rate.

(b) With respect to the Class B5 Notes, the period from and including the Sixth Closing Date to but excluding
the Note Interest Payment Date occurring on 28 February 2021, with respect to the Class B6 Notes, the period
from and including the Seventh Closing Date to but excluding the Note Interest Payment Date occurring on
28 August 2021 and with respect to the Class B7 Notes, the period from and including the Ninth Closing
Date to but excluding the Note Interest Payment Date occurring on 28 August 2024, and each period from
(and including) a Note Interest Payment Date to (but excluding) the next succeeding Note Interest Payment
Date is called a Note Interest Period. For the purposes of the foregoing, the Note Interest Payment Dates will
be 28 February and 28 August of each year (each a **_Note Interest Payment Date), commencing on 28_**
February 2021 (in respect of the Class B5 Notes), 28 August 2021 (in respect of the Class B6 Notes) and 28
August 2024 (in respect of the Class B7 Notes). If, however, any such day is not a Business Day, the Note
Interest Payment Date will instead be the next Business Day in that calendar month (if there is one) or the
preceding Business Day (if there is not).

(c) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the Issuer receives a payment of interest (whether in whole or in part)
on the Class B5 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,
then the Issuer will be obliged to make a corresponding payment of interest (in whole or in part, as the case
may be) on the Class B5 Notes on the corresponding Note Interest Payment Date. If on any Note Interest
Payment Date, the amount received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B5 Loan is
not sufficient to pay the interest accrued on the Class B5 Notes during the immediately preceding Note
Interest Period in full, the amount of interest accrued up to any such Note Interest Payment Date that is not
paid by the Issuer on such Note Interest Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest
being a Class B5 **_Deferred Interest Amount) and such Class B5 Deferred Interest Amount shall continue to_**
accrue interest at the then applicable Class B5 Note Interest Rate until it is paid by the Issuer in full.

251


-----

(d) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date:

(i) the Issuer receives a payment of interest on the Class B5 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance
with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in excess of the amount of interest accrued on
the Class B5 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period; and

(ii) on such Note Interest Payment Date, a Class B5 Deferred Interest Amount in respect of any prior
Note Interest Period remains outstanding,

then the Issuer shall apply such excess to reduce the then outstanding Class B5 Deferred Interest Amount.
Any accrued but unpaid interest and the aggregate amount of all Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts then
unpaid on the Class B5 Notes and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts (if
any) shall be due and payable by the Issuer in pounds sterling on the Class B5 Note Final Maturity Date.

(e) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the Issuer receives a payment of interest (whether in whole or in part)
on the Class B6 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,
then the Issuer will be obliged to make a corresponding payment of interest (in whole or in part, as the case
may be) on the Class B6 Notes on the corresponding Note Interest Payment Date. If on any Note Interest
Payment Date, the amount received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B6 Loan is
not sufficient to pay the interest accrued on the Class B6 Notes during the immediately preceding Note
Interest Period in full, the amount of interest accrued up to any such Note Interest Payment Date that is not
paid by the Issuer on such Note Interest Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest
being a Class B6 **_Deferred Interest Amount) and such Class B6 Deferred Interest Amount shall continue to_**
accrue interest at the then applicable Class B6 Note Interest Rate until it is paid by the Issuer in full.

(f) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date:

(i) the Issuer receives a payment of interest on the Class B6 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance
with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in excess of the amount of interest accrued on
the Class B6 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period; and

(ii) on such Note Interest Payment Date, a Class B6 Deferred Interest Amount in respect of any prior
Note Interest Period remains outstanding,

then the Issuer shall apply such excess to reduce the then outstanding Class B6 Deferred Interest Amount.
Any accrued but unpaid interest and the aggregate amount of all Class B6 Deferred Interest Amounts then
unpaid on the Class B6 Notes and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts (if
any) shall be due and payable by the Issuer in pounds sterling on the Class B6 Note Final Maturity Date.

(g) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the Issuer receives a payment of interest (whether in whole or in part)
on the Class B7 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,
then the Issuer will be obliged to make a corresponding payment of interest (in whole or in part, as the case
may be) on the Class B7 Notes on the corresponding Note Interest Payment Date. If on any Note Interest
Payment Date, the amount received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B7 Loan is
not sufficient to pay the interest accrued on the Class B7 Notes during the immediately preceding Note
Interest Period in full, the amount of interest accrued up to any such Note Interest Payment Date that is not
paid by the Issuer on such Note Interest Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest
being a Class B7 **_Deferred Interest Amount) and such Class B7 Deferred Interest Amount shall continue to_**
accrue interest at the then applicable Class B7 Note Interest Rate until it is paid by the Issuer in full.

(h) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date:

(i) the Issuer receives a payment of interest on the Class B7 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance
with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in excess of the amount of interest accrued on
the Class B7 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period; and

252


-----

(ii) on such Note Interest Payment Date, a Class B7 Deferred Interest Amount in respect of any prior
Note Interest Period remains outstanding,

then the Issuer shall apply such excess to reduce the then outstanding Class B7 Deferred Interest Amount. Any accrued
but unpaid interest and the aggregate amount of all Class B7 Deferred Interest Amounts then unpaid on the
Class B7 Notes and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts (if any) shall be
due and payable by the Issuer in pounds sterling on the Class B7 Note Final Maturity Date.

**Calculation of Class B Interest**

## 4.3 Interest in respect of the Class B Notes and interest payable in respect of any overdue amount of principal or
Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B6 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B7 Deferred Interest
Amounts (as applicable) shall be calculated by applying the applicable Class B Interest Rate to the aggregate Principal
Amount Outstanding of each sub-class of the Class B Notes or the aggregate amount of any overdue amount of
principal or Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B6 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B7 Deferred
Interest Amounts (as applicable) in respect of the Class B5 Notes, the Class B6 Notes and the Class B7 Notes as the
case may be, and on the basis of (a) the actual number of days in the period from (and including) the date from which
interest begins to accrue, being the Sixth Closing Date (in respect of the first such period for the Class B5 Notes), the
Seventh Closing Date (in respect of the first such period for the Class B6 Notes) the Ninth Closing Date (in respect of
the first such period for the Class B7 Notes) or a Note Interest Payment Date (in respect of subsequent such period))
(the Class B Accrual Date) to (but excluding) the date on which it falls due divided by (b) the actual number of days
from (and including) the Class B Accrual Date to (but excluding) the next following Note Interest Payment Date
multiplied by two; provided that in respect of accrued interest to the first Note Interest Payment Date, interest shall be
calculated on the basis of (a) in respect of the Class B5 Notes: (x) the actual number of days from (and including) the
Sixth Closing Date to (but excluding) 28 February 2021 divided by (y) the actual number of days from (and including)
28 February 2020 to (but excluding) 28 February 2021 multiplied by two; (b) in respect of the Class B6 Notes: (x) the
actual number of days from (and including) the Seventh Closing Date to (but excluding) 28 August 2021 divided by
(y) the actual number of days from (and including) 28 February 2021 to (but excluding) 28 August 2021 multiplied
by two and (c) in respect of the Class B7 Notes: (x) the actual number of days from (and including) the Ninth Closing
Date to (but excluding) 28 August 2024 divided by (y) the actual number of days from (and including) 28 February
2024 to (but excluding) 28 August 2024 multiplied by two. The resulting figure shall be rounded down to the nearest
penny.

## 5. REDEMPTION, PURCHASE AND CANCELLATION

**Final Redemption**

5.1 (a) Unless previously redeemed in full as provided in this Condition 5 (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation),
the Issuer shall redeem:

(i) the Class B5 Notes at their aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding together with any accrued but
unpaid interest, any Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts in respect of the Class B5 Notes and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B5 Note Final
Maturity Date;

(ii) the Class B6 Notes at their aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding together with any accrued but
unpaid interest, any Class B6 Deferred Interest Amounts in respect of the Class B6 Notes and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B6 Note Final
Maturity Date; and

(iii) the Class B7 Notes at their aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding together with any accrued but
unpaid interest, any Class B7 Deferred Interest Amounts in respect of the Class B7 Notes and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B7 Note Final
Maturity Date.

253


-----

(b) The Issuer may not redeem the Class B Notes in whole or in part prior to the Class B Note Final Maturity
Date except as provided below in Condition 5.2 (Redemption), Condition 5.3 (Optional Redemption for
_taxation or other reasons) or Condition 5.4 (Early redemption following a Class B Loan Enforcement Event)_
but without prejudice to Condition 9 (Class B Note Events of Default).

**Redemption**

5.2 (a) (i) The aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B5 Notes shall be repaid by the Issuer, if the
Issuer has sufficient funds to enable it to do so, on the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date, (ii) the
aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B6 Notes shall be repaid by the Issuer, if the Issuer has
sufficient funds to enable it to do so, on the Class B6 Note Expected Maturity Date, and (iii) the aggregate
Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B7 Notes shall be repaid by the Issuer, if the Issuer has sufficient
funds to enable it to do so, on the Class B7 Note Expected Maturity Date, subject to Condition 5.3 (Optional
_Redemption for taxation or other reasons), Condition 5.4 (Early redemption following a Class B Loan_
_Enforcement Event) and Condition 5.5 (Principal Amount Outstanding), as applicable._

(b) A failure of the Issuer to redeem in full the Class B5 Notes on the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date,
the Class B6 Notes on the Class B6 Note Expected Maturity Date or the Class B7 Notes on the Class B7
Note Expected Maturity Date, in each case, in accordance with these Class B Conditions and/or the
occurrence of a Class B Note Event of Default (or any event which would constitute a Class B Note Event
of Default but for Condition 9.2) will result in the Class B Note Trustee having the right (subject to the Note
Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement) at its discretion to, or shall, upon the instruction of holders of
at least 30% of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B Notes, direct the Borrower
Security Trustee to exercise its rights under the Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco Security
Documents (a Class B Trigger Event). The non-payment on any Class B Note Expected Maturity Date of
any principal amount which would otherwise be payable on such date under this Condition 5.2 (Redemption)
shall not constitute a Class B Note Event of Default pursuant to Condition 9 (Class B Note Events of Default)
including, for the avoidance of doubt, where such non-payment occurs as a result of the Issuer not receiving
any payment due under a Class B Loan on the relevant Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date. If the Issuer
receives (or is to receive) any monies from the Borrowers under the Topco Payment Undertaking or the
proceeds realised from any enforcement of the Topco Security Documents, the Issuer shall upon giving not
more than 10 nor less than 5 Business Days’ notice (which notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject
to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent) to the Class B Noteholders in accordance with
Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders), apply such monies to redeem on a pro rata basis the Class B
Notes at their respective Principal Amount Outstanding together with accrued but unpaid interest, Class B5
Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B6 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B7 Deferred Interest
Amounts (as applicable) and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any. In the
event that there are insufficient amounts to redeem all of the Class B Notes then outstanding, the Class B
Notes shall be redeemed on a pro rata basis in part in the proportion with which the repayment amount bears
to the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all the Class B Notes then outstanding.

(c) If the proceeds realised following a Class B Trigger Event are insufficient to satisfy all amounts scheduled
to be paid under paragraph (a) above, the Issuer will be obliged to apply any further amounts, if any, it
receives as a result of and pursuant to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement to repay any outstanding
amounts on the Class B Notes on a pro rata basis.

(d) In addition, promptly upon receipt by the Issuer of a notice of prepayment from a Borrower under the Class
B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement of its intention to make prepayment in whole or in part of any Class B
Loan in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer shall give not more than
60 nor less than 10 days’ notice to the relevant Class B Noteholders, the Class B Note Trustee and the
Principal Paying Agent that it will apply the principal funds received from the prepayment of the Class B
Loan to redeem a corresponding Principal Amount Outstanding of the relevant Class B Notes together with
accrued but unpaid interest, Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B6 Deferred Interest Amounts
and/or Class B7 Deferred Interest Amounts (as applicable) in respect of the relevant sub-classes of Class B
Notes and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, on the aggregate Principal
Amount Outstanding of such Class B Notes at the applicable redemption prices set out in the Class B

B Redeemed Notes represented by Class B Definitive Notes, and in accordance with the rules of Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (to be reflected in the records of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg
as either a pool factor or a reduction in nominal amount, at their discretion) in the case of Class B Redeemed
Notes represented by a Class B Global Note, not more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption
(such date of selection, the Selection Date). In the case of Class B Redeemed Notes represented by Class B
Definitive Notes, a list of the serial numbers of such Class B Redeemed Notes will be published in accordance
with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders) not less than 15 days prior to the date fixed for redemption.
No exchange of the relevant Class B Global Note will be permitted during the period from (and including)

Additional Amounts if any, on the aggregate Principal Amount of such Class B5 Notes to (but excluding)
the date of redemption at a price equal to the higher of: (i) the purchase price offered to holders of the Class
B5 Notes pursuant to the Class B5 Tender Offer and (ii) par. In determining whether at least 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B5 Notes have been validly tendered (and not
validly withdrawn) pursuant to any Class B5 Tender Offer, any Class B5 Notes owned by an Affiliate of a
Borrower or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of a Borrower, or any successor thereof, shall

**Optional Redemption for taxation or other reasons**

5.3 (a) If the Issuer at any time certifies to the Class B Note Trustee immediately prior to endeavouring to take the
reasonable measures available to it referred to below that:

which change becomes effective on or after the Sixth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B5
Notes), the Seventh Closing Date (in respect of the Class B6 Notes) or the Ninth Closing Date (in
respect of the Class B7 Notes), on the next Note Interest Payment Date, the Issuer would be required
to deduct or withhold from any payment of principal, interest or other amounts due and payable
under the relevant Class B Notes, any amount for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or
assessed by the United Kingdom or Jersey or any political sub-division thereof or any authority
thereof or therein; or

(ii) by reason of a change in tax laws or regulations (or the application or official interpretation thereof),
which change becomes effective on or after the Sixth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B5
Notes), the Seventh Closing Date (in respect of the Class B6 Notes) or the Ninth Closing Date (in

respect of the Class B6 Notes) or the Ninth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B7 Notes), it has
become or will become unlawful for the Issuer to make, fund or allow to remain outstanding all or
any advances made or to be made by it under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,

measures to avoid the effect of the relevant event described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, (including, without
limitation, appointing a Paying Agent in another jurisdiction and/or using its reasonable endeavours to

the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement; provided that the Class B Note Trustee is satisfied that taking
such measures will not be materially prejudicial to the interests of the relevant Class B Noteholders.

(b) If the Issuer satisfies the Class B Note Trustee immediately before giving the notice referred to below, that
one or more of the events described in (a) above is continuing and that the effect of the relevant event cannot

reasonable measures available to it, and (y) the Issuer will have the necessary funds to pay all principal and
interest due, if any, in respect of the relevant Class B Notes on the relevant Note Interest Payment Date and
to discharge all other amounts required to be paid by it on the relevant Note Interest Payment Date in priority

Class B Note Trustee, an opinion (in form and substance satisfactory to the Class B Note Trustee) of
independent legal advisors of recognised standing opining on the relevant event described in (a)(i), (a)(ii),

or liability) and (if applicable) such opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set out in (x) and (y) above, and it shall be conclusive and binding on the Class B Noteholders.

**Early redemption following a Class B Loan Enforcement Event**

5.4 If the Issuer receives (or is to receive) any monies from any Obligor following the service of a Class B Loan
Enforcement Notice in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement in repayment of all or any part of the Class B

Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B7 Deferred Interest Amounts (as applicable) in respect of such Class B Note
and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, on the relevant date for payment. In the
event there are insufficient monies to redeem all the Class B Notes of a particular sub-class, each relevant sub-class
of the Class B Notes shall be redeemed in part in the proportion with which the repayment amount bears to the
aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of such sub-class of the Class B Notes then outstanding.

**Principal Amount Outstanding**

5.5 (a) The Principal Amount Outstanding of a Class B Note on any date shall be its original principal amount less
the amount of all principal payments (excluding premium payable in accordance with Condition 5.2

the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of a Class B Note shall in each case (in the absence of wilful
default, bad faith or demonstrable or manifest error) be final and binding on all persons. As soon as
practicable following a determination of a Class B Note principal payment and/or the aggregate Principal
Amount Outstanding of a Class B Note, the Issuer will cause such determination of a Class B Note principal
payment and/or the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class B Note to be notified to the Class
B Note Trustee, the Class B Registrar and the Principal Paying Agent and will cause notice of each such
determination to be given to Class B Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B
_Noteholders)._

**Notice of Redemption**

a bank in London.

(c) A record of each payment so made will be endorsed on the schedule to the Class B Global Note by or on

6.2 Payments will be made by credit or transfer to an account in sterling maintained by the payee with a bank in
London.

**Payments subject to Applicable Laws**

6.3 All payments are subject in all cases (i) to any applicable fiscal or other laws, regulations and directives, but

approval of the Class B Note Trustee, at any time to vary or terminate the appointment of any Paying Agent or the
Class B Registrar and to appoint additional or other Paying Agents or Class B Registrars (including in circumstances
where the Principal Paying Agent, any Paying Agent or the Class B Registrar does not become, or ceases to be, a
Participating FFI or otherwise exempt from withholding or deduction of any Taxes (as that term is defined in Condition
7 (Taxation) below) in respect of FATCA at a time when the Issuer would be required to withhold or deduct any
amount from any payment made by it to the Principal Paying Agent, any Paying Agent or the Class B Registrar
pursuant to FATCA) provided that:

259


-----

(a) there will at all times be a person appointed to perform the obligations of the Principal Paying Agent and the
Class B Registrar;

(b) so long as the Class B Notes are listed on an exchange, there will at all times be at least one Paying Agent
(which may be the Principal Paying Agent) having its specified office in such place as may be required by
the rules and regulations of each relevant stock exchange and competent authority; and

(c) the Issuer will use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that at any time the Issuer would otherwise be required
to withhold tax on payments to the Principal Paying Agent or any other Paying Agent pursuant to FATCA,
the Principal Paying Agent and any other Paying Agents are Participating FFIs or are otherwise exempt from
withholding or deduction of any Taxes (as that term is defined in Condition 7 (Taxation) below) in respect
of FATCA.

6.7 Notice of any termination, variation or appointment and of any changes in specified offices will be given to
the Class B Noteholders promptly by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders).

## 7. TAXATION

All payments in respect of the Class B Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer shall be made without withholding
or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of
whatever nature (Taxes), unless the withholding or deduction of the Taxes is required by applicable law. In such event,
the Issuer shall account to the relevant authorities for the amount required to be withheld or deducted. In such event,
the Issuer will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the Class
B Noteholders after the withholding or deduction shall equal the respective amounts which would have been receivable
in respect of the Class B Notes in the absence of the withholding or deduction; provided that no such additional
amounts will be paid on account of:

(a) any Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any actual or deemed (pursuant to
applicable Tax law of the relevant Tax jurisdiction) present or former connection between the Class B
Noteholder (including, if applicable, a connection between partners (in the case of a partnership) or
shareholders (in the case of a corporation)) and the relevant Tax jurisdiction (including being a resident of
such jurisdiction for Tax purposes), other than holding of such Class B Note, the enforcement of rights under
such Class B Note or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Class B Note;

(b) any Taxes imposed as a result of the presentation of a Class B Note for payment more than 30 days after the
relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Class B Noteholder (except to the extent that the
holder would have been entitled to additional amounts had the Class B Note been presented on the last day
of such 30 day period);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, personal property, transfer or similar Taxes;

(d) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to, the Class
B Notes;

(e) any Taxes imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Class B Noteholder, to comply with any
reasonable written request of the Issuer or the Class B Paying Agent addressed to the Class B Noteholders
and made at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable to satisfy any
certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty,
regulation or administrative practice of a relevant Tax jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or
reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the relevant Tax jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, a certification that the Class B Noteholder is not resident in the relevant Tax
jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the Class B Noteholder or beneficial owner is legally entitled
to provide such certification or documentation;

260


-----

(f) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment to the Class B Noteholder if such Class B Noteholder
is a fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that
Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had such Class B Noteholder been the sole beneficial
owner of such Class B Notes;

(g) any Taxes payable under FATCA; or

(h) any combination of items (a) through (g) above.

of principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the Relevant Date in respect of the relevant payment.

payment first becomes due or (if the full amount of the monies payable on that date has not been duly received by the
Principal Paying Agent or the Class B Note Trustee on or prior to such date) the date on which, the full amount of
such monies having been received, notice to that effect is duly given to the relevant Class B Noteholders in accordance
with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders).

## 9. CLASS B NOTE EVENTS OF DEFAULT

9.1 Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Class B Note Trustee at its absolute discretion may, and if so
directed in writing by the holders of at least 30% of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B Notes
then outstanding or if so directed by a Class B Extraordinary Resolution of the Class B Noteholders shall (subject, in
each case, to being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction in accordance with the Note Trust Deed) give a notice
(a Class B Note Acceleration Notice) to the Issuer declaring all of the Class B Notes immediately due and payable at
any time after the occurrence of any of the following events or circumstances specified below (each such event or

warranty binding on it under any Class B Notes, Note Trust Deed, the Issuer Deed of Charge or any of the
other Transaction Documents and such failure being in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee (or, in the
case of the Issuer Deed of Charge, the Issuer Security Trustee), capable of remedy, but which remains
unremedied for a period of 21 days following the giving of notice by the Class B Note Trustee (or the Issuer
Security Trustee, as applicable) to the Issuer requiring the same to be remedied and, in either case; provided
that the Class B Note Trustee shall have determined that such event is, in its opinion, materially prejudicial
to the interests of the Class B Noteholders; or

(d) an Issuer Insolvency Event; or

(e) the delivery of the Class A Note Acceleration Notice in accordance with Condition 2.3 (Enforceable Security)
of the Class A Conditions; or

(f) it is or will become unlawful for the Issuer to perform or comply with its obligations under or in respect of
these Class B Conditions or any Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

9.2 Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, until the earlier of (i) the date on which all Class A Notes are
redeemed in full and (ii) the date on which the Class A Notes are accelerated, the occurrence of any of the events or

261


-----

circumstances described in Condition 9.1 above, which otherwise give rise to a Class B Note Event of Default, will
not constitute a Class B Note Event of Default, but will constitute a Class B Trigger Event under Condition 5.2(b).

## 10. ACCELERATION

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, upon delivery of a Class B Note Acceleration Notice, the Class B
Notes shall become immediately due and payable at their Principal Amount Outstanding together with accrued
interest, if any, Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B6 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B7
Deferred Interest Amounts (as applicable) and any accrued interest thereon, Additional Amounts, if any, and any other
amounts payable in accordance with these Class B Conditions.

## 11. ENFORCEMENT

**Service of notice**

11.1 (a) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, at any time after the service of a Class B Note Acceleration Notice
by the Class B Note Trustee in accordance with Condition 9 (Class B Note Events of Default) above, the
Class B Note Trustee at its absolute discretion may, and if so directed in writing by the holders of at least
30% in aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B Notes then outstanding, or if so directed by
a Class B Extraordinary Resolution of the Class B Noteholders shall (subject, in each case, to being
indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction in accordance with the Note Trust Deed), instruct the Issuer
Security Trustee to take enforcement steps in relation to the Issuer Security.

(b) Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Issuer Deed of Charge, if the Class B Note Trustee
provides the Issuer Security Trustee with a copy of a Class B Note Acceleration Notice given to the Issuer
and instructs it to take enforcement steps in relation to the Issuer Security, the Issuer Security Trustee is
required to give a notice (the Class B Note Enforcement Notice) to the Issuer declaring the whole of the
Issuer Security to be enforceable.

**No Class B Note Events of Default**

11.2 The Issuer, pursuant to the terms of the Note Trust Deed, shall provide on a semi-annual basis written
confirmation to the Class B Note Trustee that no Class B Note Event of Default has occurred.

## 12. LIMITED RECOURSE

12.1 Notwithstanding any other Condition or any provision of any Transaction Document, all obligations of the
Issuer to the Class B Noteholders are limited in recourse to the property, assets and undertakings of the Issuer that are
the subject of any security created by the Issuer Deed of Charge (the Issuer Secured Property). If:

(a) there is no Issuer Secured Property remaining which is capable of being realised or otherwise converted into
cash;

(b) all amounts available from the Issuer Secured Property have been applied to meet or provide for the relevant
obligations specified in, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Issuer Deed of Charge; and

(c) there are insufficient amounts available from the Issuer Secured Property to pay in full, in accordance with
the provisions of the Issuer Deed of Charge, amounts outstanding under the Class B Notes (including
payments of principal and interest),

then the Class B Noteholders shall have no further claim against the Issuer in respect of any amounts owing to them
which remain unpaid (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payments of principal and/or interest in respect of the
Class B Notes) and such unpaid amounts shall be discharged in full and any relevant payment rights shall be deemed
to cease.

against the Issuer to enforce rights under the Transaction Documents including without limitation by way of
attachment, execution or diligence, provided that nothing shall prevent a Class B Noteholder from proving for the full
amount owed to it by the Issuer in the insolvency of the Issuer.

13.2 No Class B Noteholder, nor any person acting on behalf of a Class B Noteholder (other than the Issuer
Security Trustee or any Receiver appointed by the Issuer Security Trustee), shall initiate or join any person in initiating

in any of the provisions described in the Intercreditor Agreement or this Condition not being observed.

Noteholders.

14.10 Where the Class B Note Trustee is required to have regard to the interests of the Class B Noteholders, it shall
have regard to the interests of such Class B Noteholders as a class and, in particular but without prejudice to the

264


-----

generality of the foregoing, shall not have regard to, or be in any way liable for, the consequences of such exercise for
individual Class B Noteholders resulting from their being for any purpose domiciled or resident in, or otherwise
connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any particular territory, and the Class B Note Trustee shall not be
entitled to require, nor shall any Class B Noteholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer to any other person, any
indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Class B

the provisions of this Condition 14 shall have effect subject to the following modifications:

shall be deemed to be duly approved if approved through a single vote of the holders of that sub-class of
Class B Notes;

(b) a resolution which, in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee, affects the holders of more than one sub-class
of Class B Notes but does not give rise to a conflict of interest between the holders of any sub-class of Class
B Notes so affected shall be deemed to have been duly approved if approved through (as a single Class) a
vote of the holders of all the sub-classes of Class B Notes so affected;

(c) a resolution which, in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee, affects the holders of more than one sub-class
of Class B Notes and gives or may give rise to a conflict of interest between the holders of one sub-class of
Class B Notes so affected and the holders of another sub-class of Class B Notes shall be deemed to have been
duly approved only if approved through a separate vote of the holders of each of the sub-classes of Class B
Notes;

(d) in respect of all approvals all the preceding provisions of this Condition shall apply _mutatis mutandis as_
though references to Class B Notes and Class B Noteholders were references to the sub-class of Class B
Notes in question or to the holders of such sub-class of Class B Notes, as the case may be; and

(e) no Class B Extraordinary Resolution involving a Class B Basic Terms Modification (other than where such
Class B Basic Terms Modification affects only one sub-class of Class B Notes) that is approved by the holders
of one sub-class of Class B Notes shall be effective unless it is approved by a Class B Extraordinary
Resolution of the holders of each other sub-class of Class B Notes (to the extent there are Class B Notes
outstanding in each such other sub-class).

## 15. INDEMNIFICATION AND EXONERATION OF THE CLASS B NOTE TRUSTEE AND THE ISSUER SECURITY TRUSTEE

as trustees for the holders of any other securities issued or guaranteed by, or relating to, the Issuer and/or any other
party to any of the Transaction Documents, (b) exercise and enforce its rights, comply with its obligations and perform
its duties under or in relation to any such transactions or, as the case may be, any such trusteeship without regard to
the interests of, or consequences for, the Class B Noteholders, and (c) retain and not be liable to account for any profit
made or any other amount or benefit received thereby or in connection therewith.

such terms as to evidence and indemnity as the Issuer may reasonably require. Mutilated or defaced Class B Notes
must be surrendered before new ones will be issued.

## 17. NOTICE TO CLASS B NOTEHOLDERS

17.1 Any notice shall be deemed to have been duly given to the Class B Noteholders if sent to the Clearing Systems

rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited.

17.4 The Class B Note Trustee shall be at liberty to sanction some other method of giving notice to the Class B
Noteholders if, in its opinion, such other method is reasonable having regard to market practice then prevailing and to
the requirements of the stock exchange on which the relevant Class B Notes are then admitted to trading and listed
and provided that notice of such other method is given to the Class B Noteholders in such manner as the Class B Note
Trustee shall require.

## 18. NOTIFICATION

As soon as practicable after becoming aware that any part of a payment of interest or principal on the Class
B Notes will be deferred or that a payment previously deferred will be made in accordance with these Class B
Conditions, the Issuer will give notice thereof to the Class B Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to
_Class B Noteholders)._

by the creation and issue of:

(i) further Class B Notes carrying the same terms and conditions in all respects (or in all respects except
in relation to the first Note Interest Period and first Note Interest Payment Date, the issue date, first
coupon and initial Principal Amount Outstanding) as, and so that the same shall be consolidated and

**_Further Notes); and/or_**

266


-----

(ii) new Class B Notes which may equally have terms and conditions that differ from the Class B5
Notes, the Class B6 Notes and the Class B7 Notes and which do not form a single series with the
Class B5 Notes, the Class B6 Notes or the Class B7 Notes (the Class B New Notes).

(b) It shall be a condition precedent to issue any Class B Further Notes and/or Class B New Notes (together, the
**_Class B Additional Notes) that:_**

less than £5.0 million;

(ii) in respect of any Class B Further Notes, the Rating Agencies have confirmed that such Class B
Further Notes are assigned the same ratings (or better) as are then applicable to the Class B Notes
with which they are to be consolidated and form a single series;

(iii) the Rating Agencies have provided a Rating Agency Confirmation in respect of the Class B Notes
in relation to the issue of Class B Further Notes or, as the case may be, Class B New Notes (provided
that no such Rating Agency Confirmation is required on the then existing Class B Notes where the
purpose of the Class B New Notes and the related loan to the Borrowers under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement is to refinance a Class B Loan and a sub-class of Class B Notes
in full);

(iv) an amount equal to the gross proceeds of such Class B Further Notes or, as the case may be, the
Class B New Notes (with an amount in respect of any issue expenses or commissions agreed to be

applied by the Issuer to make a loan to the Borrowers pursuant to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement and the conditions precedent therein for an advance under any Additional Class B
Facilities are satisfied;

issue of the Class B Further Notes, or as the case may be, the Class B New Notes from a reputable
international law firm; and

(vi) no Class B Note Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (which has not been waived) or
would occur as a result of such issue.

## (c) Nothing in this Condition 19 (Class B Further Notes and Class B New Notes) prohibits the Issuer from issuing
Class A Further Notes and/or Class A New Notes in accordance with the Class A Conditions.

**Deeds and Security**

19.2 Any such Class B Additional Notes will be constituted by a further deed or deeds supplemental to the Note
Trust Deed and have the benefit of the security constituted by the Issuer Deed of Charge. Any of the Transaction
Documents may be amended as provided in Condition 2.1(c) (Status and relationship between the Class B Notes) or
otherwise, and further Transaction Documents may be entered into, in connection with the issue of such Class B
Additional Notes and the claims of any of the parties to any amended Transaction Document or any further Transaction
Document may rank pari passu with or behind, the Class B Notes, provided, in each case, that the conditions set out
in Condition 19.1(a) have been satisfied, mutatis mutandis.

## 20. CLASS B CALL OPTION

20.1 The Class B Notes are issued with the benefit of the Class B Call Option (as defined in and set out in the
Intercreditor Agreement).

20.2 If a Class B Call Option Trigger Event occurs, then subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Class
B Call Option and the other terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Class B Noteholder will be entitled (but not

267


-----

obliged) to purchase all (but not some only) of the then outstanding Class A Notes at a price equal to the then aggregate
Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class A Notes together with accrued but unpaid interest.

20.3 Following notification of the occurrence of any Class B Call Option Trigger Event by or on behalf of the
Issuer to the Class B Noteholders (such notification, the Class B Call Option Notice), any Class B Noteholders who
wish to exercise the Class B Call Option must comply with the terms (as to procedures and timing for payment and
settlement) set out in the Class B Call Option Notice in order to purchase the Class A Notes in such proportions as the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement may specify.

## 21. SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE

21.1 The Class B Notes of a sub-class, and the rights of the Class B Note Trustee and the Class B Noteholders
under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Issuer Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect as to all outstanding Class B Notes of such sub-class when (1) (i) all the Class B Notes of such sub-class have
become due and payable or (ii) are scheduled to be redeemed at the relevant Class B Note Expected Maturity Date in
accordance with Condition 5.2(a) (Redemption) within one year, or (iii) will become due and payable at the relevant
Class B Note Final Maturity Date within one year or (iv) are to be called for redemption or prepayment within one
year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Class B Note Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by
the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Issuer Security Trustee (or another entity
designated or appointed as agent by the Issuer Security Trustee for this purpose), an amount in Sterling sufficient to
pay and discharge the entire outstanding principal amount on the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes, together with
any redemption premium, if any, accrued and unpaid interest, Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B6
Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B7 Deferred Interest Amounts (as applicable) in respect of such sub-class of
Class B Notes, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, to the date of deposit (in the case of Class B Notes
that have become due and payable), or to the relevant Class B Note Expected Maturity Date, the relevant Class B Note
Final Maturity Date or prepayment date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under the Class B Conditions with respect to the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes; (4) the Issuer has
delivered an irrevocable notice of redemption to the relevant Class B Noteholders and has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Issuer Security Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Issuer Security
Trustee for this purpose) to apply the funds deposited towards the payment of the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes,
at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Issuer Security
Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate (which the Issuer Security Trustee may rely on without further inquiry and without
liability) to the effect that all conditions precedent under these Class B Conditions relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes have been complied with.

## 22. NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of Topco or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Topco, Issuer or any Guarantor under
the Class B Finance Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
creation. Each Class B Noteholder by accepting a Class B Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Class B Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public
policy.

## 23. RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES

No rights are conferred on any person under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any
term of the Class B Notes or these Class B Conditions, but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party
which exists or is available apart from the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

## 24. GOVERNING LAW

Each of the Transaction Documents, the Class B Global Notes and these Class B Conditions (and, in each
case, any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the relevant document) are governed by, and

268


-----

shall be construed in accordance with, English law (other than the Issuer Jersey Corporate Services Agreement, the
Issuer Deed of Charge (to the extent governed by Jersey law), the Security Interest Agreement and the Topco Share
Security Agreement, which will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, Jersey law and Cayman Islands
law, respectively).

## 25. JURISDICTION

The courts of England are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute including any dispute as to any
non-contractual obligations that may arise out of or in connection with the Class B Notes and the Transaction
Documents (save to the extent governed by Jersey law) to which the Issuer is party and, accordingly, any legal action
or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Class B Notes and/or the Issuer Transaction Documents may
be brought in such courts. The Issuer has in each of the Issuer Transaction Documents to which it is a party irrevocably
submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE CLASS B7 LOAN**

_Under the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer agreed to make available to the_
_Borrowers on the Ninth Closing Date the facilities as described below. The following is a summary of certain_
_provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. It is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed_
_provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. Capitalised terms used, but not defined in this_
_“Description of the Class B7 Loan” shall have the meaning given to them in the section “Description of Certain_
_Financing Arrangements” or “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes” set out in this Offering Memorandum, as_
_applicable._

On the Ninth Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Class B7 Notes will be applied by the Issuer to
make advances to the relevant Borrowers in an aggregate principal amount of £330,000,000, pursuant to the terms of
the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the Issuer will provide to the Borrowers
secured facilities in an aggregate principal amount of £330,000,000 with the proceeds of the issue of the Class B7
Notes (the “Class B7 Facility” and the advance thereunder, the “Class B7 Loan”), which will be contractually
subordinated to the Class A Facilities pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The economic terms and conditions of the Class B7 Facility (including, among other things, in relation to the
payment of interest and the repayment and prepayment of principal) will be broadly similar to the terms and conditions
of the Class B7 Notes.

On the Fourth Closing Date, the Issuer issued the Class B4 Notes. The Class B4 Notes are expected to be
redeemed in full with the proceeds of the issue of the Class B7 Notes. On the Sixth Closing Date, the Issuer issued the
Class B5 Notes. On the Seventh Closing Date, the Issuer issued the Class B6 Notes. Pursuant to the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer provided to the Borrowers secured facilities in an aggregate principal
amount of £250,000,000 with the proceeds of the issue of the Class B4 Notes (the “Class B4 Facility” and the advance
thereunder, the “Class B4 Loan”), in an aggregate principal amount of £250,000,000 with the proceeds of issue of
the Class B5 Notes (the “Class B5 Facility” and the advance thereunder, the “Class B5 Loan”) and in an aggregate
principal amount of £255,000,000 with the proceeds of the issue of the Class B6 Notes (the “Class B6 Facility” and
the advance thereunder, the “Class B6 Loan”), which are each contractually subordinated to the Class A Facilities
pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Class B5 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full by 28 August 2026 (the “Class B5 Note Expected
**Maturity Date”). The Class B6 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full by 28 August 2027 (the “Class B6 Note**
**Expected Maturity Date”). The Class B5 Loan is expected to be redeemed in full by 25 August 2026 (the “Class B5**
**Loan Expected Maturity Date”) and the Class B6 Loan is expected to be redeemed in full by 25 August 2027 (the**
“Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date” and together with the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date and the
Class B7 Loan Expected Maturity Date (as defined below), each a “Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date”).

**REPAYMENT**

The Borrowers must repay the Class B7 Loan in full on the Class B7 Loan Final Maturity Date to the extent
not repaid, prepaid or otherwise discharged in full prior to that date.

The occurrence of the Class B7 Loan Expected Maturity Date does not in and of itself result in any
outstanding principal amounts under the Class B7 Loan becoming due. However, if, on the Class B7 Loan Expected
Maturity Date the Class B7 Loan remains outstanding, Topco will be required, under the terms of the Topco Payment
Undertaking, to procure the payment of an amount equal to the aggregate of:

(a) the then outstanding aggregate principal balance on the Class B Loans;

(b) accrued but unpaid interest then outstanding in respect of the Class B Loans;

(c) any Additional Amounts; and

(d) all other amounts due and payable (including, without limitation, premium and interest on overdue
amounts) by the Obligors to the Issuer under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

Failure by Topco to pay such amount will give the right to the Borrower Security Trustee (on instruction
from the Class B Note Trustee as directed by the Class B Noteholders) to enforce the Topco Security granted to it (on
trust for the Issuer) by Topco over the shares Topco holds in Holdco and the shares Holdco holds in Intermediate
Holdco, in each case in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**PREPAYMENT**

**Optional prepayment**

At any time prior to 28 August 2026, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions prepay up to 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Class B7 Loan at a prepayment price equal to   % of the principal amount of
the Class B7 Loan prepaid upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of prepayment (subject to the rights of the Issuer to receive interest on the
relevant Loan Interest Payment Date), with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the initial Class B7 Loan remains outstanding
immediately after the occurrence of such prepayment; and

(2) the prepayment occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

Prior to 28 August 2026, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions prepay during each calendar year
up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Class B7 Loan (including the original principal amount
of any Additional Class B7 Loan), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price of
103.000% of the principal amount of the Class B7 Loan so prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable prepayment date (subject to the right of the Issuer to receive
interest due on the relevant Loan Interest Payment Date).

In addition, at any time prior to 28 August 2026, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions, at their
option, prepay all or a part of the Class B7 Loan upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a
prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Class B7 Loan prepaid, plus the Applicable Premium
and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of prepayment (subject to the rights of
the Issuer to receive interest due on the relevant Loan Interest Payment Date).

Except as described in the first, second and third paragraphs above and set out under “— Taxes — Repayment
_for taxation reasons”, the Class B7 Loan will not be pre-payable at the Borrowers’ option prior to 28 August 2026._

On or after 28 August 2026, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions prepay all or a part of the
Class B7 Loan upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at the prepayment prices (expressed as
percentages of principal amount) set out below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest
Amount, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B7 Loan
prepaid, to (but excluding) the applicable date of prepayment, if prepaid during the 12-month period beginning on 28
August of the years indicated below, subject to the rights of the Issuer to receive interest on the relevant Loan Interest
Payment Date:

**Year** **Redemption Price**
2026.................................................................................................. %
2027.................................................................................................. %
2028 and thereafter ........................................................................... 100.000%

Unless the Borrowers default on the payment of the prepayment price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Class B7 Loan or portions thereof called for prepayment on the applicable prepayment date.

Any prepayment or notice may, at the Borrowers’ discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent.

Upon any prepayment of the Class B7 Loan pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer will redeem a pro rata
portion of the Class B7 Notes in accordance with the Class B Conditions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale
Offer for the Class B7 Notes, if not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B7
Notes are validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and purchased pursuant to such tender offer, Change of Control
Offer or Asset Sale Offer (as applicable) by a Borrower, the Borrowers may prepay the remaining principal amount
of the Class B7 Loan, in whole, but not in part, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (and provided
that such notice is delivered no later than 60 days following the purchase date in respect of such tender offer, Change
of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer (as applicable)), at a price equal to the purchase price offered to holders of the
Class B7 Notes pursuant to the tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer (as applicable) (which may

271


-----

be less than par) plus accrued and unpaid interest, Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amount, if any, and any accrued
but unpaid interest thereon, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B7 Loan prepaid to (but excluding) the
applicable date of prepayment. In accordance with the Class B Conditions, in determining whether at least 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B7 Notes have been validly tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) pursuant to any tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable, Notes owned by
an Affiliate of a Borrower or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of a Borrower, or any successor thereof,
shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer,
as applicable.

**Mandatory Prepayment**

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Borrowers shall, within one Business Day of receipt of any
monies received by the Borrowers under the Topco Payment Undertaking, apply such monies to prepay the maximum
amount of the Class B Loans (together with all accrued and unpaid interest, Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amounts,
if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, and Additional Amounts, if any) that may be prepaid with such
monies.

**INTEREST**

**Calculation of interest**

The rate of interest on the Class B7 Loan for each Loan Interest Period (as defined below) is the percentage
per annum as follows:

(1) in respect of any Loan Interest Period falling in the period starting on (and including) the Ninth
Closing Date and terminating on (and excluding) the Class B7 Loan Step-Down Date,      % per annum; and

(2) in respect of any Loan Interest Period falling after (and including) the Class B7 Loan Step-Down
Date up to (but excluding) the Class B7 Loan Final Maturity Date,      % per annum,

(each, the applicable “Class B7 Interest Rate”).

The period from (and including) the Ninth Closing Date to (but excluding) the first Loan Interest Payment
Date and each successive period from (and including) a Loan Interest Payment Date to (but excluding) the next
succeeding Loan Interest Payment Date, is called a “Loan Interest Period”.

**Payment of interest**

Subject to the following three paragraphs, the Borrowers must pay accrued interest on the Class B Loans on
each Loan Interest Payment Date.

From (and including) the Ninth Closing Date to (but excluding) the Class B7 Loan Expected Maturity Date
(as defined below), interest will accrue on any overdue amount of principal or interest (including Additional Amounts,
if any) in respect of the Class B7 Loan at the applicable Class B7 Interest Rate. For the avoidance of doubt, any failure
to pay interest on a Loan Interest Payment Date will not constitute a Class B Loan Event of Default for as long as any
Class A Notes remain outstanding but will constitute a Share Enforcement Event. The “Class B7 Loan Expected
**Maturity Date” will be the date falling three Business Days prior to the Class B7 Note Expected Maturity Date. The**
“Class B7 Note Final Maturity Date” will be the Note Interest Payment Date falling on 28 August 2055.

From (and including) the Class B7 Loan Expected Maturity Date, interest will accrue on the principal amount
of the Class B7 Loan at the applicable Class B7 Interest Rate until (but excluding) the Class B7 Loan Final Maturity
Date but such accruing interest will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest being a “Class B7 Loan
**Deferred Interest Amount”) and such Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amount shall accrue interest at the then**
applicable Class B7 Interest Rate until it is paid by the Borrowers in full. On each Loan Interest Payment Date, interest
accrued on the Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amount during the immediately preceding Loan Interest Period shall
be added to the then outstanding Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and thereafter paid at the times and in the
same manner as the Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amount. The Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon will be payable by the Borrowers only on the earlier of (x) the date on which the
Class A Loans are repaid in full (the “Initial Payment Date”) and (y) the Class B7 Note Final Maturity Date (as
defined above); provided that if on the Initial Payment Date, the Borrowers do not have sufficient cash to pay the
Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon in full on such date in accordance
with the Borrower Priorities of Payments, any unpaid Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but

272


-----

unpaid interest thereon will not fall due then but will continue to be deferred and will only fall due for payment on
any subsequent Loan Interest Payment Date to the extent of the cash available to the Borrowers for such purpose
determined in accordance with the Borrower Priorities of Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Class B7
Loan, any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, any Class B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon may be repaid prior to the Class B7 Note Final Maturity Date using (A) New Equity Funds
received by the Borrowers, (B) funds available following the enforcement of the Topco Security, and/or (C) following
the enforcement of the Borrower Security Documents to the extent funds are available for this purpose pursuant to the
applicable Priorities of Payments (as described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —
_Intercreditor Agreement”)._

**PAYMENTS**

Unless a Class B Finance Document specifies that payments under it are to be made in another manner
(including any payments in specie pursuant to Condition 5.7 of the Class B Conditions), all payments by any Obligor
to the Issuer under the Class B Finance Documents must be made to the Issuer Transaction Account (or such other
account as the Issuer or, following a Class B Loan Event of Default, the Borrower Security Trustee may specify to the
Borrowers by not less than ten Business Days’ prior written notice).

**TAXES**

**Additional Amounts**

In the event that (i) any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes is required to be made
from payments made by the Issuer under or with respect to the Class B7 Notes and (ii) the Issuer is required under the
Class B Conditions to pay additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) on the Class B7 Notes such that the net
amounts received by each holder of Class B7 Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any such
withholding or deduction in respect of such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have
been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction, the Issuer shall promptly
give written notice of such requirement to the Borrowers and each Borrower will pay such Additional Amounts as
specified in such notice as may be necessary for the Issuer to comply with its obligations under the Class B Conditions.

Each Obligor must make all payments to be made by it under the Class B Finance Documents without any
Tax Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by law.

If an Obligor or the Issuer (or any permitted assignee) is aware that an Obligor must make a Tax Deduction
(or that there is a change in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction), it must promptly notify the other Parties.

If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by an Obligor, the amount of the payment due from the
Obligor will be increased by an amount (also an Additional Amount) that (after making the Tax Deduction) leaves an
amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.

If an Obligor is required to make a Tax Deduction, that Obligor must make the minimum Tax Deduction
allowed by law and must make any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction within the time allowed
by law.

Within 30 days of making either a Tax Deduction or a payment required in connection with a Tax Deduction,
the Obligor making that Tax Deduction or payment must deliver to the Issuer evidence satisfactory to the Issuer that
the Tax Deduction has been made or (as applicable) the appropriate payment has been paid to the relevant taxing
authority.

**Repayment for taxation reasons**

The Borrowers may repay the Class B7 Loan in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee (which notice will be irrevocable)
at a repayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, Class
B7 Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date fixed for
repayment (a “Tax Repayment Date”) (subject to the right of the Issuer to receive interest due on the relevant Loan
Interest Payment Date) and all Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Repayment
Date as a result of the repayment or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer, Borrowers or Guarantors determine in good faith
that the Issuer has the right to redeem the Class B7 Notes upon the occurrence of any of the events listed in Condition
5.3 of the Class B Conditions as set out in the Note Trust Deed. The Borrowers will promptly notify the Issuer and
the Borrower Security Trustee if they elect to repay the Class B7 Loan pursuant to this covenant. If the Borrowers so

273


-----

elect to repay the Class B7 Loan, the Borrowers will deliver to the Borrower Security Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
stating that it is entitled to effect such repayment and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right so to repay have been satisfied. The Borrower Security Trustee will accept such Officer’s
Certificate as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further
inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers and thereafter the Borrowers must repay
or prepay the Class B7 Loan in full on the date specified in the next paragraph below and the Issuer will redeem all of
the Class B7 Notes in accordance with the Class B Conditions.

The date for repayment or prepayment of the Class B7 Loan will be the earlier of:

(a) the relevant Loan Interest Payment Date in respect of the then current Loan Interest Period; or

(b) the date specified by the respective Borrowers in their notification.

**CLASS B CHANGE OF CONTROL**

If a Class B Change of Control occurs with respect to any sub-class of Class B Notes, the Borrowers will
make an offer to the holders of such sub-class of Class B Notes (a “Class B Change of Control Offer”) to repurchase
all or any part (equal to £100,000 or an integral multiple of £1,000 in excess thereof) of the Class B Notes held by
such holders. In the Class B Change of Control Offer, the Borrowers will offer a payment equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, the applicable Class B
Note Deferred Interest Amount, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, and Additional Amounts, if any,
on the Class B Notes of such sub-class repurchased to the date of purchase (the “Class B Change of Control
**Payment”), subject to the rights of holders of the Class B Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on**
the relevant interest payment date; provided, however, that the Borrowers will not be obliged to repurchase the Class
B Notes as described under this “— Class B Change of Control” covenant in the event and to the extent that any
Borrower has unconditionally exercised its right to prepay all of the Class B Loans as described under “— Prepayment
— Optional prepayment” or all conditions to such repurchase have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Borrowers have unconditionally exercised their right to repay the Class B Loans in full as set out
in “— _Prepayment_ — _Optional prepayment” (and all of the relevant Class B Notes have been correspondingly_
redeemed by the Issuer) or all conditions to such repayment have been satisfied or waived, within 30 days following
any Class B Change of Control, the Borrowers will be obliged to deliver a notice to the Issuer, the Class B Note
Trustee and each holder of the Class B Notes to which such Class B Change of Control applies in accordance with the
Class B Conditions, stating:

(1) that a Class B Change of Control Offer is being made and that all Class B Notes tendered will be
accepted for payment;

(2) the purchase price and the prepayment date, which shall be no earlier than 10 days and no later than
60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the “Class B Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) that any Class B Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) that, unless the Borrowers default in the payment of the Class B Change of Control Payment, all
Class B Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Class B Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest
after the Class B Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that holders of Class B Notes electing to have any Class B Notes purchased pursuant to a Class B
Change of Control Offer will be required to transfer the Class B Notes to the nominated account as specified in the
notice of the Class B Change of Control Offer;

(6) that holders of Class B Notes will be entitled to withdraw their election if they deliver notice to the
Borrower (at such facsimile number or address as specified in the notice of the Class B Change of Control Offer), not
later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Class B Change of Control Payment Date,
a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of Class B Notes, the principal amount of Class
B Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing its election to have the Class B Notes
purchased; and

(7) that holders of Class B Notes whose Class B Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued
new Class B Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Class B Notes surrendered, which
unpurchased portion must be equal to £100,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of £1,000 in excess thereof.

274


-----

The Borrowers will be required to comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent
those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the purchase of the Class B Notes as a result of a Class
B Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions
described in this section, the Borrowers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not
be deemed to have breached their obligations under the provisions described in this section by virtue of such
compliance.

On the Class B Change of Control Payment Date, to the extent lawful:

(1) the Borrowers will accept for purchase all or portions of Class B Notes properly tendered pursuant
to the Class B Change of Control Offer;

(2) the Borrowers will deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Class B Change
of Control Payment in respect of all or portions of the Class B Notes properly tendered by such holder for payment
into the account of each tendering holder of Class B Notes (as specified in such holder’s acceptance of the Class B
Change of Control Offer) no later than five days after the Class B Change of Control Payment Date and no later than
60 days from the date the notice set forth in the second paragraph of this covenant has been mailed to holders of Class
B Notes to which such Class B Change of Control applies; and

(3) the Borrowers will deliver or cause to be delivered to the Issuer (in satisfaction, prepayment and
discharge of a pro rata portion of each Borrowers’ liability under the Class B Loans) the Class B Notes properly
accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes being
purchased by the Borrowers and the Issuer shall then deliver such Class B Notes to the Principal Paying Agent and
shall take all other actions and deliver all documents and certificates as are required under the Note Trust Deed or
requested by the Principal Paying Agent to effect a cancellation of such Class B Notes.

The Borrowers will not be required to make a Class B Change of Control Offer with respect to any sub-class
of Class B Notes upon a Class B Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Class B Change of Control Offer for
such sub-class of Class B Notes in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set out
in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement applicable to a Class B Change of Control Offer made by the
Borrowers and purchases all Class B Notes of such sub-class properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Class B
Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of redemption with respect to such sub-class has been given pursuant to “—
_Prepayment — Optional prepayment”, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption_
price by the Borrowers in connection with the repayment of the relevant Class B Loans, or by the Issuer in connection
with the redemption of a pro rata portion of the relevant Class B Notes.

The Issuer will be required to cooperate with the Borrowers in connection with any Class B Change of Control
Offer (including, without limitation, by delivering such notices to the Class B Note Trustee and the holders of Class
B Notes to which such Class B Change of Control applies as the Borrowers may require in order to enable the
Borrowers to comply with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph), and the Borrowers will bear the cost of any
such Class B Change of Control Offer.

**CERTAIN COVENANTS**

**Class B Financial Covenant**

_Required Class B FCF DSCR_

Subject to “— Cure right” as set out below, the Borrowers must ensure that, on each Financial Covenant Test
Date, the ratio of Class B FCF to the Class B Total Debt Service Charges (such ratio, expressed as a percentage, the
“Class B FCF DSCR”) for the applicable FCF DSCR Period is equal to or greater than 100%.

In respect of the calculation of the Class B FCF DSCR on the first and second Financial Covenant Test Date
after the Fourth Closing Date, the Class B Total Debt Service Charges will be deemed to be equal to the actual
annualised Consolidated Interest Expense payable by Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries with effect from the Fourth
Closing Date.

For these purposes each of Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall set their relevant Accounting Periods
such that the end date of the Accounting Period immediately preceding each Financial Covenant Test Date shall be a
date which is not more than 12 weeks prior to such Financial Covenant Test Date.

_Cure right_

If:

(1) as at a Financial Covenant Test Date (as described in this paragraph, the “Relevant Financial
**Covenant Test Date”), the Class B FCF DSCR is less than 100%;**

(2) within the period of 30 days thereafter, the Borrowers procure that either:

(A) the Class A Loans and/or the Class B Loans are prepaid in part; and/or

(B) funds are deposited into (or remain in) the Defeasance Account,

using or having been funded by New Equity Funds (the amount so prepaid or deposited, the “Class
**B Specified Amount”); and**

(3) the Recalculated Class B FCF DSCR is not less than 100%,

then for all purposes thereafter (including, without limitation, as to any determination of the occurrence of a Share
Enforcement Event or a Class B Loan Event of Default) the Class B FCF DSCR as at the Relevant Financial Covenant
Test Date shall be deemed to have been the same as the Recalculated Class B FCF DSCR.

The Borrower Security Trustee must, as soon as is reasonably practicable after being so requested, but in any
event not earlier than the Business Day immediately following the Relevant Financial Covenant Test Date, consent to
the release of funds from the Defeasance Account (deposited in the Defeasance Account pursuant to the preceding
paragraph) if and to the extent that, following such release, the Recalculated Class B FCF DSCR (disregarding the
Class B Specified Amount (if any) requested to be so released) remains at or greater than 100% (as certified by CP
Opco in the Class B Compliance Certificate to be provided in connection with such Relevant Financial Covenant Test
Date).

**Limitation on Financial Indebtedness**

Topco will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Financial
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), provided, however, that Topco and any Obligor may Incur Financial
Indebtedness if the Issuer obtains a Rating Agency Confirmation in respect of the Class B Notes.

The provisions described in the preceding paragraph will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following
Financial Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Financial Indebtedness”):

(ii) (A) Guarantees by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Financial
Indebtedness of Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in each case so long

(B) without limiting the provisions described in “— Limitations on Liens”, Financial
Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person

Ratio would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition

Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Class

extent Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Financial Indebtedness in reliance
thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular

(i) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Financial Indebtedness that is otherwise
included in the determination of a particular amount of Financial Indebtedness shall not be

(ii) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments are Incurred pursuant to any credit facility and are being treated as Incurred
pursuant to clauses (i), (vii) or (xii) of the second paragraph of this covenant and the letters
of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Financial
Indebtedness, then such other Financial Indebtedness shall not be included;

(iii) [reserved];

(iv) Financial Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be Incurred solely by reference
to one provision permitting such Financial Indebtedness but may be Incurred in part by one
such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such
Financial Indebtedness;

279


-----

(v) the amount of Financial Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount
thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the
basis of IFRS;

(vi) for the avoidance of doubt, the Incurrence of any Financial Indebtedness by Topco will
only be permitted if it also complies with the provisions described in “— Limitation on
_Holding Company Activities”;_

(vii) subject to clause (viii) below, in the event that Financial Indebtedness meets the criteria of
more than one of the types of Financial Indebtedness described in the first and second
paragraphs of this covenant, Topco, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time
to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount
and type of such Indebtedness in the first paragraph or second paragraph of this covenant;
_provided, that_ Financial Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (i) of the second
paragraph of this covenant that was outstanding on the Sixth Closing Date, the Seventh
Closing Date or the Ninth Closing Date, as applicable, may not be reclassified;

(viii) all Financial Indebtedness outstanding on the Ninth Closing Date under the Class A Loans
and the Class B Loans shall be deemed initially Incurred on the Ninth Closing Date under
clause (iv)(A) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph of this
covenant or clause (iv)(B) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and without limiting
any permitted refinancing pursuant to clause (iv)(C) of the second paragraph of this
covenant, may not be reclassified pursuant to clause (vii) of this paragraph; and

(ix) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption
or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortisation of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Financial Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends on Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Preferred
Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Financial Indebtedness
due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Financial Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant.
The amount of any Financial Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (i) the accreted value thereof in the case
of any Financial Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (ii) the principal amount or liquidation
preference thereof, in the case of any other Financial Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Financial Indebtedness of
such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of Topco as of such date (and, if such
Financial Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, Topco shall be in default
of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Financial Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of Financial Indebtedness denominated in
another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Financial
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Financial Indebtedness, or, at the option of Topco, first committed, in
the case of Financial Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; _provided_ that (i) if such Financial
Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Financial Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and
such refinancing would cause the applicable sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall
be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Financial Indebtedness
does not exceed the principal amount of such Financial Indebtedness being refinanced; (ii) the Sterling Equivalent of
the principal amount of any such Financial Indebtedness outstanding on the Sixth Closing Date shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Sixth Closing Date, the Sterling Equivalent of the
principal amount of any such Financial Indebtedness outstanding on the Seventh Closing Date (that was not
outstanding on the Sixth Closing Date) shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the Seventh Closing Date and the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Financial Indebtedness
outstanding on the Ninth Closing Date (that was not outstanding on the Sixth Closing Date or the Seventh Closing

280


-----

Date) shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Ninth Closing Date; and (iii) if
and for so long as any such Financial Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in
which such Financial Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Financial Indebtedness, the
amount of such Financial Indebtedness, if denominated in sterling, will be the amount of the principal payment
required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Sterling Equivalent of such amount plus the
Sterling Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency
Agreement. For purposes of calculating compliance with clause (i) of the second paragraph (of this covenant or for
calculating the amount of Financial Indebtedness outstanding under any Credit Facility, to the extent a Credit Facility
is utilised for the purpose of Guaranteeing or cash collateralising any letter of credit or Guarantee, such Guarantee or
collateralising and issuance of such letter of credit or Guarantee shall be deemed to be a utilisation of such Credit
Facility permitted under clause (i) of the second paragraph above.

Subject to the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, any Borrower may at any time serve
written notice to the Issuer with a copy to the Borrower Security Trustee requesting from the Issuer such further and/or
additional term loan facilities, each in a maximum aggregate principal amount not exceeding the principal amount of
any issue of Class B Additional Notes issued by the Issuer to fund its obligations under the Class B Issuer/ Borrower
Loan Agreement in respect of the relevant additional Class B Facility (each an “Additional Class B Facility”) if the
following conditions are satisfied (as certified by the Borrower), or will be satisfied by the time of such issue:

(1) the aggregate amount of any Additional Class B Facility is to be for a minimum aggregate principal
amount of £5.0 million;

(2) the conditions to the issue by the Issuer of the corresponding Class B Additional Notes have been
satisfied, or will be satisfied by the time of such issue;

(3) the payment of interest and principal with respect to any such Additional Class B Facilities will rank
pari passu with or after any then outstanding Class B Facility; and

(4) the Incurrence of Financial Indebtedness under such Additional Class B Facility is permitted under
“— Limitation on Financial Indebtedness”.

Notwithstanding the provisions described above, the maximum amount of Financial Indebtedness that Topco
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur under the provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement shall not
be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount
of any Financial Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Financial Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency
from the Financial Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable
to the currencies in which such Refinancing Financial Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of the
relevant refinancing.

**Class B Restricted Payments**

Topco will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

first day of the Accounting Period during which the Fourth Closing Date occurred to the end of the
most recently ended Accounting Period for which internal financial statements are available at the

succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or marketable securities, received by Topco or any
Restricted Subsidiary upon such conversion or exchange); plus

(4) the amount equal to the net reduction in Restricted Investments made by Topco or any of its

case, as provided in the definition of Investment) not to exceed, in the case of any
Unrestricted Subsidiary, the amount of Investments previously made by Topco or any
Restricted Subsidiary in such Unrestricted Subsidiary, which amount, in each case under
this clause (4), was included in the calculation of the amount of Class B Restricted

stock ownership plan or trust established by Topco or any Subsidiary of Topco for the
benefit of its employees to the extent funded by Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary) of
Capital Stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary of Topco; and

(ii) any dividend or distribution made by an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Affiliate to Topco or a
Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in the preceding clause (1) to the extent that it_

fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of Intermediate Holdco.

“Cumulative Interest Expense” means, in respect of any Class B Restricted Payment, the sum of the
aggregate amount of Consolidated Interest Expense of Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the period from and
after the first day of the Accounting Period during which the Fourth Closing Date occurs to the end of Topco’s most
recently ended Accounting Period for which financial statements are available at the time of the proposed Class B

this covenant or otherwise to facilitate any dividend or other return of capital to the holders
of such Capital Stock (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
Intermediate Holdco);

(xiii) Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the
aggregate cash amount of Excluded Contributions, or consisting of non-cash Excluded

such Class B Restricted Payment.

The amount of all Class B Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of
such Class B Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by Topco or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Class B Restricted Payment. The fair market value
of any cash Class B Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Class B
Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors of Intermediate Holdco acting in good
faith. Unsecured Financial Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be subordinated or junior to secured Financial
Indebtedness by virtue of its nature as unsecured Financial Indebtedness.

**Anti-layering**

Topco will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Financial Indebtedness
(including Permitted Financial Indebtedness) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Class A
Loans unless such Financial Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to or ranks pari passu
with the Class B Loans to the same extent.

286

**Limitations on Liens**

Topco will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur,
assume or otherwise suffer to exist any Lien which secures any Financial Indebtedness (other than in the case of any
assets or property of any Restricted Subsidiary, Permitted Liens or, in the case of any assets or property of Topco,
Permitted Topco Liens or, in the case of any property or assets constituting Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens) on
any of its assets or property, now owned or hereafter acquired.

**Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries**

Topco will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary
to:

(i) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or
pay any Financial Indebtedness or other obligations owed to an Obligor;

(ii) make any loans or advances to an Obligor; or

(iii) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to an Obligor;

_provided_ that (A) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (B) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary to other
Financial Indebtedness Incurred by Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions described in the paragraph above will not prohibit:

(i) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (A) any Credit Facility or (B) any other
agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Fourth Closing
Date, including the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Class B Issuer/Borrower

Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by Topco or
any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital
Stock or Financial Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any
portion of the funds utilised to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions
pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by Topco
or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into Topco or any Restricted
Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such
date;

refinancing of Financial Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances,
an agreement or instrument referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph or this clause
(iii) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other
modification to an agreement referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph or this clause
(iii); _provided,_ _however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such_
Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favourable
in any material respect to the holders of the Class B Notes, taken as a whole, than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to
which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of Intermediate Holdco);

(iv) any encumbrance or restriction:

287


-----

(A) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, licence or similar contract, or the
assignment or transfer of any lease, licence or other contract;

(B) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted
under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or securing Financial

charges or other security agreements; or

(C) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests
set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of Topco or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(v) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalised

case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property so acquired or any

on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

(vi) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its
property or assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect

Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending
the closing of such sale or disposition;

(vii) customary provisions in leases, licences, joint venture, concession or permit agreements
and other similar agreements and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of
business;

(viii) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any
applicable rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

any Financial Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Sixth Closing Date
or the Seventh Closing Date, as applicable, or with respect to the Class B7 Notes, the Ninth
Closing Date, as described in “— _Limitation on Financial Indebtedness” if the_
encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a
whole are not materially less favourable to the holders of the Class B Notes than (A) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement
or the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, together with the security documents
associated therewith as in effect on the Sixth Closing Date or the Seventh Closing Date, as
applicable, or with respect to the Class B7 Notes, the Ninth Closing Date; (B) any

of Directors of Intermediate Holdco); or

(xii) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted as described in “—
_Limitations on Liens”._

Topco will not, directly or indirectly: (i) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not
Topco is the surviving corporation), or (ii) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole in one or more
related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(II) Switzerland;

(III) Guernsey;

(IV) the Cayman Islands; or

(V) the United States;

under the Class B Notes, the Class B Loans, the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Borrower Security Documents;

(iii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Class B Loan Default, Share
Enforcement Event or Class B Loan Event of Default, as the case may be, exists; and

(iv) Topco or the Person surviving any such consolidation or merger has obtained a Rating
Agency Confirmation.

otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to
Topco, (b) any Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or
transfer all or part of its properties and assets to Topco, a Borrower or a Guarantor and (c)
Topco may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated
or organised for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of Topco, reincorporating

An Obligor will not directly or indirectly: (A) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or
not such Obligor is the surviving Person) or (B) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its assets to, another Person, unless:

applicable provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

Notwithstanding clause (i)(A) of the second paragraph of this covenant (which does not apply to transactions
referred to in this sentence), (i) any Obligor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or
part of its properties and assets to another Obligor or Topco and (ii) an Obligor may consolidate or otherwise combine

289

with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organised for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Obligor,
reincorporating the Obligor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Obligor.

**Asset Sales**

Topco will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly make any Asset
Sale unless:

(i) Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to
be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors of Intermediate Holdco, of the shares and assets
subject to such Asset Sale (including for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Sale is a
Permitted Asset Swap); and

(ii) in any such Asset Sale, or series of related Asset Sales (except to the extent the Asset Sale
is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Sale
(excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Financial
Indebtedness) received by Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in
the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments. For the purposes of
this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(A) the assumption by the transferee of Financial Indebtedness of Topco or Financial
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of
Topco or an Obligor) and the release of Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary from
all liability on such Financial Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale;

(B) securities, notes or other obligations received by Topco or any Restricted
Subsidiary of Topco from the transferee that are converted by Topco or such
Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following
the closing of such Asset Sale;

(C) Financial Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that Topco and each other
Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such
Financial Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale;

(D) consideration consisting of Financial Indebtedness of Topco (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Fourth Closing Date and that is
cancelled from Persons who are not Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(E) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by Topco or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken
together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to
this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of £36.0
million and 2.0% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each item of
Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); and

(iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Sale is applied by
Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(A) to the extent Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is
required by the terms of any Financial Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary),
(1) to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase any Financial Indebtedness under the
Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, any Financial Indebtedness Incurred
under clause (i) of the second paragraph described under “— _Limitation on_
_Financial Indebtedness” (or any Refinancing Financial Indebtedness in respect_
thereof) or any other Financial Indebtedness secured by a first priority Lien on the

290


-----

Collateral within 365 days from the later of (x) the date of such Asset Sale and (y)
the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection
with any prepayment or repayment of Financial Indebtedness pursuant to this
clause (1), Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Financial
Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) (except in the case
of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) to be permanently reduced in
an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid or repaid; (2) to prepay, repay,
purchase or redeem Financial Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not
a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets which do not constitute
Collateral (in each case, other than Subordinated Indebtedness of Topco or a
Guarantor or Indebtedness that is owed to Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary); (3)
to purchase the Class B Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of the Class B
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount
of the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but
not including, the date of purchase, on such sub-class of Class B Notes; or (4) to
prepay, repay, redeem or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more
than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment or purchase;
_provided that Topco shall redeem repay or repurchase Pari Passu Indebtedness_
pursuant to this clause (4) only if the Borrowers make (at such time or
subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the holders of the Class
B Notes of each sub-class to purchase their Class B Notes in accordance with the
provisions set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer for an aggregate principal
amount of Class B Notes of the relevant sub-class at least equal to the proportion
that (i) the total aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes outstanding in such
sub-class bears to (ii) the sum of the total aggregate principal amount of Class B
Notes outstanding in such sub-class plus the total aggregate principal amount
outstanding of such Pari Passu Indebtedness as well as the total aggregate
principal amount of any other sub-class of Class B Notes; or

(B) to the extent Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary elects to invest in or commit to
invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional
Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by Topco or
another Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (1) the date of
such Asset Sale and (2) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; _provided,_
however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a
definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors
of Intermediate Holdco that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy
this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of
such 365th day; and provided further, that, if the Asset Sale relates to Collateral,
to the extent such Additional Assets are of the same type as any asset constituting
Collateral, such Additional Assets are substantially, simultaneously with their
acquisition, pledged under the Borrower Security Documents, with the security
interest on such Additional Assets securing the Class B Loans and the Class B
Notes with the same priority with respect to the Class B Loans and the Class B
Notes as the security interest on the Collateral subject to the Asset Sale, provided
that in the case of Net Available Cash received from an Asset Sale of Collateral,
none of the Obligors may apply such Net Available Cash to repay Financial
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not an Obligor; or

(C) consummate any combination of the foregoing,

_provided further_ that pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in
accordance with clauses (A), (B) or (C), Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
temporarily reduce Financial Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in
any manner not prohibited by the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

291


-----

The amount of Net Available Cash from Asset Sales that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied
or invested as provided in clause (iii) above will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement; provided that (a) to the extent that the Consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeds 7.5 to
1.00, any Net Available Cash from Asset Sales that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested
as provided in clause (iii) above; (b) to the extent that the Consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeds 7.0 to 1.00 but does
not exceed 7.5 to 1.00, 50% of any Net Available Cash from Asset Sales that is not applied or invested or committed
to be applied or invested as provided in clause (iii) above; and (c) to the extent that the Consolidated Leverage Ratio
does not exceed 7.0 to 1.00, 0% of any Net Available Cash from Asset Sales that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in clause (iii) above, will be deemed to constitute Excess Proceeds
under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

On or prior to the 366th day (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in clause (iii)(B) above
has been entered into) after the later of (A) an Asset Sale and (B) the receipt of Net Available Cash, if the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement exceeds £20.0 million, the Borrowers
will be required to make an offer (or procure that an offer is made) (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of the Class
B Notes and, to the extent the Borrowers elect, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase,
prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of the Class B Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which
the Asset Sale Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of each subclass of Class B Notes in an amount at least equal to (and, in the case of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price
of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of such sub-class of Class B Notes and 100% of the principal amount
of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase, the applicable Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amount, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon,
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this covenant or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness,
as applicable, and in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

Each Asset Sale Offer will remain open for a period of at least 20 Business Days following its commencement
and not more than 30 Business Days, except to the extent that a longer period is required by applicable law (the “Offer
**Period”). No later than three Business Days after the termination of the Offer Period (the “Purchase Date”), the**
Borrowers will apply all Excess Proceeds (the “Offer Amount”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of Class
B Notes and, if applicable, any such Pari Passu Indebtedness (on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount of
Class B Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered, if applicable) or, if less than the Offer Amount has been
tendered, all Class B Notes and, if applicable, other Financial Indebtedness tendered in response to the Asset Sale
Offer. Payment for any Class B Notes and, if applicable, any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, so purchased will be made
in the same manner as interest payments are made. If the Purchase Date is on or after an interest record date and on or
before the related interest payment date, any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the Person in whose
name a Class B Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be
payable to holders of Class B Notes who tender Class B Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer.

Upon the commencement of an Asset Sale Offer, the Borrowers shall (or upon request of the Borrowers, the
Issuer shall) send, by first class mail, a notice to the Issuer and (for the purposes of information only) to the Borrower
Security Trustee. The notice, which will govern the terms of the Asset Sale Offer, will state:

(i) that the Asset Sale Offer is being made pursuant to this covenant and the length of time the
Asset Sale Offer will remain open;

(ii) the Offer Amount, the purchase price and the Purchase Date;

(iii) that any Class B Note not tendered or accepted for payment will continue to accrue interest;

(iv) that, unless the Borrowers default in making such payment, any Class B Note accepted for
payment pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Purchase
Date;

(v) that holders of Class B Notes electing to have a Class B Note purchased pursuant to an
Asset Sale Offer may elect to have Class B Notes purchased in integral multiples of £1,000
only (provided that Class B Notes of £100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and
not in part);

292


-----

(vi) that holders of Class B Notes electing to have Class B Notes purchased pursuant to any
Asset Sale Offer will be required to transfer the Class B Notes to the nominated account as
specified in the notice of the Asset Sale Offer;

(vii) that holders of Class B Notes will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Issuer and/or
the Borrowers receive (at such facsimile number or address as specified in the notice of the
Asset Sale Offer), not later than the expiration of the Offer Period, a facsimile transmission
or letter setting forth the name of the holder of Class B Notes, the principal amount of Class
B Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing its election
to have the Class B Notes purchased;

(viii) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness
surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the Offer Amount, the Borrowers will select the
Class B Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on
the principal amount of Class B Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered (with
such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Borrowers so that only Class B
Notes in denominations of £1,000, or integral multiples thereof, will be purchased
(provided that Class B Notes of £100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not
in part)); and

(ix) that holders of Class B Notes of any sub-class whose Class B Notes are being purchased
only in part will be issued new Class B Notes of such sub-class equal in principal amount
to the unpurchased portion of the Class B Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion
must be equal to £100,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of £1,000 in excess
thereof.

On or before the Purchase Date, the Borrowers will, to the extent lawful:

(i) accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Offer Amount of Class
B Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer, or if less than the
Offer Amount has been tendered, all Class B Notes tendered;

(ii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Issuer (in satisfaction, prepayment and discharge of
a pro rata portion of each Borrower’s liability under the applicable Class B Loans) the
Class B Notes properly accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating that such
Class B Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Borrowers in
accordance with the terms of this covenant and the Issuer shall then deliver such Class B
Notes to the Principal Paying Agent and shall take all other action and deliver all
documents and certificates required under the Note Trust Deed or required by the Principal
Paying Agent to effect cancellation of the Class B Notes; and

(iii) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the purchase price in respect
of all Class B Notes or portions of Class B Notes properly tendered by such holder for
payment into the account of each tendering holder of Class B Notes (as specified in such
holder’s acceptance of the Asset Sale Offer) no later than five days after the Purchase Date.

The Issuer shall cooperate with the Borrowers in relation to any Asset Sale Offer, and the Borrowers shall
bear the cost of such Asset Sale Offer (including, without limitation, by delivering such notices to holders of Class B
Notes as the Borrowers may require in order to enable the Borrowers to comply with the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph).

If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, Topco and its Restricted
Subsidiaries may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement. If the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes tendered into (or to be redeemed in connection
with) such Asset Sale Offer and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds
the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Class B Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis, based on the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes of each
sub-class and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds will be reset at zero.

293


-----

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Class B Notes is denominated
in a currency other than sterling, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Class B Notes shall not exceed the net
amount of funds in sterling that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into sterling.

Following any acceptance by the holders of Class B Notes of any Asset Sale Offer, the Borrowers will be
required to prepay the applicable Class B Loans at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any) in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any) of the relevant
sub-class of Class B Notes so tendered in such Asset Sale Offer.

**Transactions with Affiliates**

Topco will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to or sell, lease,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into
or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or Guarantee with, or for the
benefit of, any Affiliate of Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving
aggregate payments or consideration in excess of £10.0 million, unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favourable
to Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be
obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the
agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not
such an Affiliate; and

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of £25.0
million, the terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of
the Board of Directors of Intermediate Holdco.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (ii) of the
first paragraph of this covenant if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors.
If there are no Disinterested Directors, any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements
set forth in this covenant if Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to the Borrower
Security Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to Topco or such
Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that the terms are not materially less favourable to
Topco or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by
Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s length basis.

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the
provisions of the first paragraph of this covenant:

(i) any Class B Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the provisions described
in “— _Class B Restricted Payments”, any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to_
clause (ix)(B) of the definition of Permitted Payments) or any Permitted Investment (other
than Permitted Investments as defined in clauses (a)(ii), (b) and (o) of the definition
thereof);

(ii) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other
securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to,
or the funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting,
collective bargaining or benefit plan, programme, agreement or arrangement, related trust
or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or
other rights to purchase Capital Stock of Topco, any Restricted Subsidiary of Topco or any
Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans,
participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation,
health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans,
programmes or arrangements) or payments of customary fees and reimbursements of
expenses to, or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or
consultants approved by the Board of Directors, in each case in the ordinary course of
business;

(iii) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

294


-----

(iv) any transaction between or among Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or entity
that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among
Restricted Subsidiaries;

(v) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and
pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of
Topco, any Restricted Subsidiary of Topco or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly
and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or
employees);

(vi) the entry into and performance of obligations of Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for
purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Fourth Closing
Date, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented,
extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of
this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the holders of the Class B Notes
in any material respect in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Topco or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary and the entry into and performance of any registration
rights or other listing agreement in connection with any Public Offering;

(vii) the execution, delivery and performance of any tax sharing agreement to the extent not
prohibited by the definition of Permitted Payments or the formation and maintenance of
any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the
ordinary course of business;

(viii) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, providers of employees or other
labour (including, without limitation, with respect to the management, development,
maintenance or refurbishment of real property and other related services), suppliers or
purchasers or sellers of goods or services (including, without limitation, with respect to
insurance and reinsurance services), in each case in the ordinary course of business, which
are fair to Topco or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of
the Board of Directors or the senior management of Topco or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favourable than those that could reasonably have been
obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(ix) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among Topco or any
Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of Topco that would constitute an Affiliate
Transaction solely because Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of Topco or
a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an Equity Interest
in or otherwise controls such Affiliate;

(x) (A) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated
Preference Shares) of Topco or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital
Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; _provided_ that the interest rate and other
financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of
the members of the Board of Directors in their reasonable determination and (B) any
amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder
Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement;

(xi) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (xii) hereof, (A)
payments by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to any Parent or Permitted Holder
(whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent) of customary annual
management, consulting, monitoring or advisory fees and related expenses and (B)
customary payments by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to any Parent or
Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent) for

investment banking activities, including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures,

which payments in respect of this clause (B) are approved by a majority of the Board of
Directors in good faith;

(xii) payment to any Parent or Permitted Holder of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
Incurred by such Parent or Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect
investment in Topco and its Subsidiaries;

(xiii) the Incurrence or amendment of any Subordinated Shareholder Funding;

(xiv) transactions between any of the Obligors and any person, a director of which is also a
director of the relevant Obligor or any direct or indirect parent of such Obligor; provided,
_however, that such director abstains from voting as a director of the relevant Obligor or_
such direct or indirect parent, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other
person;

(xv) any Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisation;

(xvi) the Transaction Documents;

(xvii) any transaction that is, directly or indirectly, related to the Ireland Site or an Additional
Site and is otherwise permitted by the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(xviii) any Affiliate Transaction with the Issuer provided it complies with the covenants set forth
in the Note Trust Deed;

(xix) the existence of, or the performance by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its
obligations under the terms of, any stockholders agreement (including any registration
rights agreement or purchase agreement related thereto) to which it (or any Parent of the
Topco) is a party as of the Fourth Closing Date and any similar agreements which it (or
any Parent of Topco) may enter into thereafter; _provided_ that the existence of, or the
performance by the Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or such Parent) of
obligations under any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any
similar agreement entered into after the Fourth Closing Date shall only be permitted by this
clause (xx) to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not
otherwise disadvantageous in any material respect in the good faith judgment of Topco to
the Class B Lenders when taken as a whole; and

(xx) (i) the Transactions, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of Topco or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated
by, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument
in effect as of or on the Fourth Closing Date or described in “Certain Relationships and
_Related Party Transactions” in the 2017 Class B Notes Offering Memorandum, as these_
agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended,
renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of
this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Class B Noteholders in any
material respect, and (iii) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other
listing agreement.

**Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Certain Financial Indebtedness**

Topco will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to
Guarantee the payment of any Class A Loans, Additional Class A Loans or Financial Indebtedness Incurred under a
Credit Facility of a Guarantor or a Borrower (or, in each case, any Refinancing Financial Indebtedness Incurred in
respect thereof) unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers an accession agreement to the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement providing for the Guarantee of the payment of the Class B Loans and the
Class B Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Guarantee will be pari passu with or junior to such Restricted
Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such Class A Loans, Additional Class A Loans or Financial Indebtedness Incurred under a
Credit Facility (or, in each case, any Refinancing Financial Indebtedness Incurred in respect thereof).

Each such additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognise certain defences generally available
to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial

296


-----

assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of
creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to any Guarantees of any Restricted Subsidiary:

(i) existing on the Fourth Closing Date; or

(ii) given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided
profits of not less than £250.0 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such Guarantee
was given, of at least “A” or the equivalent thereof by S&P and Fitch, in connection with
the operation of cash management programmes established for the benefit of the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Topco shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee
the payment of the Class B Loans or the Class B Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary
would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in:

(i) a violation of applicable law which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided
through measures reasonably available to Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary; or

(ii) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary.

**Reports**

For so long as any Class B Loan is outstanding, Topco will provide to the Borrower Security Trustee and the
Class B Note Trustee (for the benefit of the Class B Noteholders) the following reports:

(i) within 120 days after the end of Intermediate Holdco’s financial year, annual reports
containing the following information: (A) audited consolidated balance sheets of
Intermediate Holdco as of the end of the two most recent financial years and audited
consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of Intermediate Holdco for
the two most recent financial years, including complete footnotes to such financial
statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (B) pro
forma income information and balance sheet information of Intermediate Holdco (which,
for the avoidance of doubt shall not include the provision of a full income statement or
balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes,
for any material acquisitions or dispositions that represent greater than 20% of the
consolidated revenues, EBITDA, or assets of Intermediate Holdco or recapitalisations that
have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed financial year as to which
such annual report relates; (C) an operating and financial review of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity and capital resources of Intermediate Holdco, and a discussion of material
commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies and (D) a description of
material risk factors and material recent developments of the Group.

(ii) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three financial quarters in each
financial year of Intermediate Holdco, all quarterly reports of Intermediate Holdco
containing the following information: (A) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the
most recent quarter and year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance
sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods, together with condensed footnote
disclosure; (B) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of Intermediate
Holdco (which, for the avoidance of doubt shall not include the provision of a full income
statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions or dispositions that represents greater
than 20% of the consolidated revenues, EBITDA or assets of Intermediate Holdco or
recapitalisations that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant quarter, in each case
unless pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clauses (i)
and (iii) or this clause (ii); (C) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations and financial condition,

297


-----

EBITDA, and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of Intermediate Holdco;
and (D) material recent developments of Intermediate Holdco;

(iii) within ten days after the occurrence of (A) a material acquisition, disposition or
restructuring; (B) any senior management change at Topco; (C) any change in the auditors
of Intermediate Holdco; (D) the entering into an agreement that would result in a Class B
Change of Control; or (E) any material events that any Obligor announces publicly, in each
case, a report containing a description of such events; and

(iv) on each Semi-Annual Investor Reporting Date, CP Opco must provide details of a
telephone conference into which the Class A Noteholders and Class B Noteholders may
dial, on which the senior management of the Obligors must present their financial results
for the relevant period, provided that CP Opco shall only be required to hold telephone
conferences if so required under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above will not be required to (A) contain any_
reconciliation to U.S. GAAP or (B) include separate financial statements for any Obligors or any Subsidiaries of
Intermediate Holdco that are not Obligors.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that material differences exist between the results of operations
or financial condition of Topco and Intermediate Holdco, the annual and quarterly reports shall give a reasonably
detailed description of such differences. Topco may at any time elect to become the reporting entity in place of
Intermediate Holdco, after which election, references to the “Intermediate Holdco” in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) and the
proviso above shall be deemed to refer to Topco.

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS. Except as provided for above, no report
need include separate financial statements for the Obligors or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations
or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the 2017 Class B Notes Offering Memorandum,
the 2020 Class B Notes Offering Memorandum, the 2021 Class B Notes Offering Memorandum or in this Offering
Memorandum.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Borrower Security Trustee of the reports specified in
clause (i), (ii) and (iii) above, Topco shall (1) make available copies of all reports required on its website or (2)
otherwise provide substantially comparable public availability of such reports (as determined by the Board of Directors
of Intermediate Holdco in good faith).

For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Class B Note Trustee nor the Borrower Security Trustee shall be
responsible for monitoring or confirming the validity or accuracy of the reports or information delivered pursuant to
this covenant or compliance by Topco with its obligations under this covenant.

In addition, Topco shall furnish to the Class B Noteholders and to prospective investors, upon the request of
such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so
long as the Class B Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under
the Securities Act.

Subject to compliance with the immediately following paragraph of this covenant, in the event that, and for
so long as, the equity securities of Topco or any Parent or IPO Entity are listed on any Qualified Stock Exchange and
the listed entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted
to trading on such Qualified Stock Exchange, for so long as it elects, Topco will make available to the Borrower
Security Trustee and the Class B Note Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that it
or such Parent or IPO Entity is, or would be, required to file with such Qualified Stock Exchange. Upon complying
with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such requirements require Topco or any Parent or IPO Entity to
prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other reports with such Qualified Stock Exchange, Topco
will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Topco may also comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this covenant
by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent of Topco so long as such reports (if an
annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of the
first paragraph of this covenant as if references to the Intermediate Holdco therein were references to such Parent and
(b) include condensed consolidated financial information together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent; (ii)
Intermediate Holdco and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Parent on

298


-----

a combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts. Upon complying with the
foregoing requirement, Topco will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding
paragraphs.

**Conduct of Business/Business Activities**

The Obligors will not engage in any business other than a Class B Permitted Business, except to the extent
as would not be material to the Obligors, taken as a whole.

**Limitation on Holding Company Activities**

Topco and Holdco must not carry on any business or own any assets other than:

(i) (a) with respect to Topco, the ownership of Capital Stock of Holdco and (b) with respect
to Holdco, the ownership of Intermediate Holdco;

(ii) conduct of their business as holding companies, including the provision of administrative
services (excluding treasury services but including the on-lending of monies to their
respective Restricted Subsidiaries) and management services to its Subsidiaries of a type
customarily provided by a holding company to its Subsidiaries and the ownership of assets
necessary to provide such services;

(iii) activities undertaken with the purpose of fulfilling rights and obligations arising under the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party, asset and liabilities under the Transaction
Documents, and professional fees and administration costs in connection therewith and
otherwise in the ordinary course of business as a holding company;

(iv) credit balances in bank accounts and Investments in cash and Cash Equivalents;

(v) subject to the provisions described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant,
Incurring Financial Indebtedness as described in “— _Limitation on Financial_
_Indebtedness” (including activities reasonably incidental thereto, including performance of_
the terms and conditions of such Financial Indebtedness, to the extent such activities are
otherwise permissible under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) and the
granting of Liens as described in “— Limitations on Liens”;

(vi) making Investments in the Class B Notes or Financial Indebtedness as described in “—
_Limitation on Financial Indebtedness”;_

(vii) directly related or reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of its or
its Subsidiaries’ corporate existence or for the purpose of transferring such property and
assets to any Parent or other Person;

(viii) activities pursuant to or in connection with the Transactions; or

(ix) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are de minimis in nature or ancillary
to or related to those listed in this covenant.

Neither Topco nor Holdco will, directly or indirectly, Incur any Financial Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness, but excluding any outstanding intercompany Financial Indebtedness existing on the Fourth Closing
Date) other than (i) the Incurrence of obligations or liabilities arising by operation of law, (ii) the Incurrence of
liabilities to pay Taxes and paying Taxes, (iii) the Incurrence such as may arise of liabilities under the Topco Payment
Undertaking of the Topco Transaction Documents, and neither Topco nor Holdco will issue any Disqualified Stock.

Neither Topco nor Holdco will, directly or indirectly, create, Incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to
exist or become effective any Lien of any kind securing Financial Indebtedness upon any of its property or assets,
now owned or hereinafter acquired, except to secure any Permitted Topco Lien.

Neither Topco nor Holdco will take, or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which action or
omission would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the collateral granted under
the relevant Topco Security Documents (it being understood that the Incurrence of Liens on the Topco Security
permitted by the definition of Permitted Topco Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the
security interest with respect to the Topco Security) for the benefit of the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer,
and neither Topco nor Holdco will grant to any Person other than the Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the

299


-----

Issuer and the other beneficiaries described in the Topco Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in the Topco Security; provided that (a) nothing in this
provision shall restrict the discharge or release of the Topco Security in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement, the Topco Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and (b) Topco and Holdco may Incur Permitted Topco Liens; provided further, however, that, subject to
the foregoing, Topco Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified, replaced, or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking
over the same assets) unless Topco or Holdco, as applicable, contemporaneously with such amendment, extension,
replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, renewal or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the assets), delivers to the Borrower Security Trustee (i) a certificate from the Board
of Directors or chief financial officer of the relevant Person (acting in good faith) that confirms the solvency of the
Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, replacement, supplement, modification or release, or (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications),
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the Topco Payment
Undertaking created under the Topco Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
modified, replaced or released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to
immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or
release and retaking.

**Impairment of Security Interest**

Topco will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission would have the result of materially impairing the security
interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by
the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security
interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Borrower Security Trustee and the holders of the Class B
Notes, and Topco will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other
than the Borrower Security Trustee, for the benefit of the Borrower Security Trustee and the Class B Notes and the
other beneficiaries described in the Borrower Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this provision
shall restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement, the Borrower Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and (b) Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens; provided further, however, that,
subject to the foregoing, no Borrower Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced, or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets) unless Topco contemporaneously with such amendment, extension,
replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, renewal or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the assets), delivers to the Borrower Security Trustee (i) a certificate from the Board
of Directors or chief financial officer of the relevant Person (acting in good faith) that confirms the solvency of the
Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, replacement, supplement, modification or release, or (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications),
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the Class B Loans created
under the Borrower Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced
or released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation imperfection or new
hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking.

At the direction of Topco and without the consent of the holders of the Class B Notes, the Borrower Security
Trustee may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Borrower Security Documents to:

(i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein;

300


-----

(ii) subject to compliance with the provisions described in the first paragraph of this covenant,
provide for Permitted Collateral Liens;

(iii) add to the Collateral; or

(iv) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of
the Class B Notes in any material respect.

In the event that Topco complies with the provisions described in “— Impairment of Security Interest”, the
Borrower Security Trustee shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release with no need for instructions from
the holders of Class B Notes.

**Financial Calculations**

Prior to the Existing Class B Loans Discharge Date, when calculating the availability under any basket or
ratio under the Class B Loans, in each case in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of
determination of such basket or ratio and of any Share Enforcement Event or Class B Loan Default or Class B Loan
Event of Default shall, at the option of Topco, be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition
Acquisition are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated with such pro forma adjustments as are
appropriate and consistent with the pro forma provisions set forth in the definitions of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio after giving effect to such Limited
Condition Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence
of Financial Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period
for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition (and not for purposes
of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or
ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in EBITDA of
Topco or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the
relevant Limited Condition Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result
of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Acquisition is permitted
hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition
Acquisition or related transactions; provided further that if Topco elects to have such determinations occur at the time
of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any incurrence of Financial Indebtedness and
the use of proceeds therefrom) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and
outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Class B Loans after the date of such
agreement and before the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition.

Following the Existing Class B Loans Discharge Date, when determining or calculating the availability under
any basket, threshold or ratio under the Class B Loans in connection with any transaction or whether such transaction
is permitted under the Class B Loans (including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, testing any
Incurrence or assumption of Financial Indebtedness or Liens, the making of any Restricted Payment, Permitted
Payment or Investment, any Asset Sale, any acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other business
combination and any other transaction requiring the testing of any basket, threshold or ratio based on, inter alia, the
EBITDA of Topco), the date of determination of such basket or ratio or the testing of any such transaction and of any
Share Enforcement Event or Class B Loan Default or Class B Loan Event of Default shall, at the option of Topco, be
(A) the date the definitive agreements for such transaction are entered into (the “Transaction Commitment Date
**Election”) or (B) the date of consummation of any such transaction.**

If Topco makes a Transaction Commitment Date Election, such baskets, thresholds or ratios shall be
calculated with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma provisions set forth
in the definitions of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Senior Secured
Leverage Ratio after giving effect to such transaction and other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith
(including any Incurrence of Financial Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the
beginning of the applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction, and,
for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets, thresholds or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in
such basket, threshold or ratio (including due to fluctuations in EBITDA of Topco or that arises from an asset or a
target company subject to such transaction) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the
consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets, thresholds or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded
as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transaction is permitted hereunder and

301


-----

(y) such baskets, thresholds or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or related
transactions; provided further if Topco makes a Transaction Commitment Date Election, any such transactions
(including any Incurrence of Financial Indebtedness and the use of proceeds therefrom) shall be deemed to have
occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered into, and deemed to be outstanding thereafter, for purposes
of calculating any baskets, thresholds or ratios under the Class B Loans after the date of such agreement and before
the consummation of such transaction. To the extent the date of determination of a basket, threshold or ratio is tested
prior to the date of consummation of a transaction, such basket, threshold or ratio shall be deemed utilized to the same
extent until the earlier of the date of consummation of such transaction or the date such transaction is terminated or
expires without consummation, except that, in the case of an acquisition, merger or consolidation, any calculation of
EBITDA for purposes other than Incurrences of Financial Indebtedness or Liens or the making of Restricted Payments
(not related to such acquisition, merger or consolidation) shall not reflect such transaction until it has been
consummated.

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

At the request of Topco, in connection with the Incurrence or refinancing by Topco or its Restricted
Subsidiaries of any Financial Indebtedness secured or permitted to be secured on the Collateral, Topco, the relevant
Restricted Subsidiaries and the Borrower Security Trustee shall enter into an intercreditor or similar agreement (an
“Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) with the creditors of such Financial Indebtedness (or their duly authorised
representatives) on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or on terms not materially less
favourable to the holders of the Class B Notes), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to the
application of the proceeds of the collateral held thereunder and the means of enforcement; _provided_ that such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Borrower Security Trustee or, in
the opinion of the Borrower Security Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the
Borrower Security Trustee under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement. As
used herein, the term Intercreditor Agreement shall include references to any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that
supplements or replaces the Intercreditor Agreement.

At the written direction of Topco and without the consent of the holders of the Class B Notes, the Borrower
Security Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to:

(i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement;

(ii) increase the amount or types of Financial Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that
may be Incurred by Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries that are subject to any such
agreement (provided that such Financial Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) (including the addition of provisions relating to
new Financial Indebtedness ranking junior or pari passu in right of payment with the Class
B Loans and the Class B Notes);

(iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iv) further secure the Class B Loans (including any Additional Class B Loans) in accordance
with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(v) make provision for equal and rateable pledges of the Collateral to secure Class B
Additional Notes and any Additional Class B Loans or to implement any Permitted
Collateral Liens;

(vi) grant any Additional Class B Facility or amend any existing Class B Facility to provide for
further advances; and/or

(vii) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of
the Class B Notes in any material respect. Topco shall not otherwise direct the Borrower
Security Trustee to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the
consent of holders of the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Class B Notes of such sub-class then outstanding, except as
otherwise permitted as described in “— Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the
terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and Topco may only direct the Borrower Security
Trustee to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any
personal obligations on the Borrower Security Trustee or, in the opinion of the Borrower

302


-----

Security Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the
Borrower Security Trustee under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement relating to
the Class B Loans, the Class B Notes or any Intercreditor Agreement.

Each holder of the Class B Notes, by accepting a Class B Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of any Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the
future pursuant to the provisions described herein).

**SHARE ENFORCEMENT EVENT AND CLASS B LOAN EVENT OF DEFAULT**

**Share Enforcement Event**

For so long as any Class A Loans or Additional Class A Loans are outstanding, each of the following is a
“Share Enforcement Event” under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement:

(i) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Class B Loan
when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(ii) if any amount (including, without limitation, any principal amount or premium of a Class
B Loan) remains outstanding (whether or not then due and payable) under a Class B Loan
as at close of business on the Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date of such Class B Loan;

(iii) failure to pay the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Class B Loan upon
optional redemption, upon required repurchase or upon declaration;

(iv) failure by Topco and/or Holdco to comply with the provisions described in “— Certain
_Covenants — Limitation on Holding Company Activities”;_

(v) failure to comply for 30 days after written notice by the Borrower Security Trustee on
behalf of the holders of the Class B Notes or by the holders of at least 30% in principal
amount of the outstanding Class B Notes with Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries’
obligations described in “— Class B Change of Control” (in each case, other than a failure
to purchase Class B Notes which will constitute a Share Enforcement Event under clause
(ii) above);

(vi) failure to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Borrower Security Trustee on
behalf of the holders of the Class B Notes or by the holders of at least 30% in principal
amount of the outstanding Class B Notes with Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ other
agreements contained in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, subject to the cure
rights described in “— Certain Covenants — Class B Financial Covenant — Cure right”;

(vii) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or
by which there may be secured or evidenced any Financial Indebtedness for money
borrowed by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is
Guaranteed by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Financial
Indebtedness owed to Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Financial
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(A) is caused by a failure to pay principal on such Financial Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Financial
Indebtedness (“Payment Default”); or

(B) results in the acceleration of such Financial Indebtedness prior to its maturity
(“Cross-Acceleration”),

and, in each case, (I) the aggregate principal amount of any such Financial
Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Financial
Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of
which has been so accelerated, equals £25.0 million or more and (II) other than a
Payment Default with respect to Financial Indebtedness Incurred under the Class
A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or under any Credit Facility;

303


-----

(viii) Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of
Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole constitutes a Significant Subsidiary pursuant
to or within the meaning of Bankruptcy Law:

(A) commences a voluntary case;

(B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case;

(C) consents to the appointment of a custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its
property; or

(D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;

(ix) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:

(A) is for relief against Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole
constitutes a Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case;

(B) appoints a custodian of Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole
constitutes a Significant Subsidiary or for all or substantially all of the property
of Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group
of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary; or

(C) orders the liquidation of Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole
constitutes a Significant Subsidiary,

and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days;

(x) failure by Topco or any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that
taken as a whole constitutes a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of £25.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has
acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a
period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final;

(xi) any security interest under the Borrower Security Documents on any material Collateral
shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the
terms of the relevant Borrower Security Document and the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or the release or amendment of any such security
interest in accordance with the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or
such Borrower Security Document or any such security interest created thereunder shall be
declared invalid or unenforceable or Topco shall assert in writing that any such security
interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Class B Loan Default continues for ten
days;

(xii) any Class B Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with
the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or Topco or a Guarantor denies or disaffirms
its obligations under its Class B Guarantee in writing, other than in accordance with the
terms thereof or upon release of the Class B Guarantee in accordance with the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement; and

(xiii) a Class B Note Event of Default (not giving effect, for these purposes, to the provisions of
Condition 11.2 of the Class B Conditions) or a Class B Trigger Event has occurred (subject
to any relevant grace period or cure rights).

However, a default under any of the provisions described under clauses (v), (vi), (vii) or (x) above will not
constitute a Share Enforcement Event until the Borrower Security Trustee or the holders of 30% in principal amount
of the outstanding Class B Notes notify Topco of the default and, with respect to clauses (v), (vi), (vii) and (x), Topco

304


-----

does not cure such default (or procures that such default is cured) within the time specified in clauses (v), (vi), (vii) or
(x), as applicable, after receipt of such notice.

In the event of a declaration of enforcement of the Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco Security
Documents because a Share Enforcement Event described in clause (vii) above has occurred and is continuing, the
declaration of enforcement of the Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco Security Documents shall be
automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Share Enforcement Event pursuant
to clause (vii) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Financial Indebtedness, or the Financial
Indebtedness that gave rise to such Share Enforcement Event shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after
the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the declaration of enforcement of the
Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco Security Documents would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction and (2) any other then existing Share Enforcement Events have been cured or waived.

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will provide that (i) if a Share Enforcement Event occurs for
a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such
Initial Default is cured, such Share Enforcement Event for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in
connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Share Enforcement Event
for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants—Reports”
or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or
certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

If a Share Enforcement Event occurs and is continuing, the Borrower Security Trustee acting upon the
instructions of the Issuer Security Trustee as directed by the Class B Note Trustee, who shall be required to act if
directed by the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Class B Notes, may by notice to Topco
enforce the Topco Payment Undertaking and Topco Security Documents in accordance with their terms and the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Class B Loan Event of Default**

If at any time either (i) no amounts remain outstanding under any Class A Loans or Additional Class A Loans
or (ii) an acceleration of the amounts that remain outstanding under any Class A Loans has occurred, each of the Share
Enforcement Events set out in “— Share Enforcement Event” above will also constitute a “Class B Loan Event of
**Default”.**

In addition, whether or not any amounts remain outstanding under any Class A Loans or Additional Class A
Loans, any default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Class B Loan borrowed under
the Class B Issuer/ Borrower Loan Agreement when due on the applicable Class B Loan Final Maturity Date shall be
a Class B Loan Event of Default.

If a Class B Loan Event of Default (other than a Class B Loan Event of Default described in clauses (viii) or
(ix) of the first paragraph of “— Share Enforcement Event”, above) occurs and is continuing, the Borrower Security
Trustee by notice to Topco on the instruction of the Issuer Security Trustee (who acts on the instructions of the Class
B Note Trustee, as directed by the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Class B Notes) in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, may declare the principal or premium, if any, and accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Class B Loans to be due and payable. Upon such a
declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, the applicable Class B Loan Deferred Interest
Amounts, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately.

If a Class B Loan Event of Default described in clauses (viii) or (ix) of the first paragraph of “— Share
_Enforcement Event” above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest,_
the applicable Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B Loans
will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Borrower
Security Trustee or any holders of Class B Notes.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Class B Loans because a Class B Loan Event of Default
described in clause (vii) of the first paragraph of “— Share Enforcement Event” above has occurred and is continuing,
the declaration of acceleration of the Class B Loans shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment
default triggering such Class B Loan Event of Default pursuant to clause (vii) shall be remedied or cured, or waived

305


-----

by the holders of the Financial Indebtedness, or the Financial Indebtedness that gave rise to such Class B Loan Event
of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto
and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Class B Loans would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Class B Loan Events of Default, except non-payment of principal,
premium or interest on the Class B Loans that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Class B Loans,
have been cured or waived.

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver
a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will
also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the
time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice
or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement shall be deemed to be
cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even
though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

No Class B Loan Event of Default may occur with respect to the Class B Loans while any amounts remain
outstanding under any of the Class A Loans (until after an acceleration of the Class A Loans) although this is without
prejudice to the ability of the Borrower Security Trustee, at the direction of the Class B Noteholders, to enforce the
security granted pursuant to the Topco Security Documents in certain circumstances including, without limitation,
where there has been a failure to pay cash interest on the Class B5 Loan prior to the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity
Date, on the Class B6 Loan prior to the Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date or on the Class B7 Loan prior to the
Class B7 Loan Expected Maturity Date or a failure to repay principal and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon on
such date. Where there is such a failure to pay and for so long as such Class B Loan remains outstanding thereafter
(whether or not security is being enforced), any overdue amount of principal or interest and such Class B Loan will
bear interest at the interest rates set out in the second and third paragraphs under “— Interest — Payment of interest”
above, as applicable.

**AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS**

**Procedure**

Any term of the Class B Finance Documents may be amended or waived with the agreement of the Borrowers
(or CP Opco on their behalf), the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement.

Each Guarantor agrees to (and authorises CP Opco to execute on its behalf) any amendment or waiver
allowed by this covenant which is agreed to by the Borrowers (or CP Opco on their behalf). This includes any
amendment or waiver which would, but for this paragraph, require the consent of each Guarantor if the Class B
Guarantee under the Class B Finance Documents is to remain in full force and effect.

**POST-CLOSING REORGANISATIONS**

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement also provides that a number of post-closing transactions will
be permitted (subject to certain conditions being satisfied), including:

**Longleat Headlease Transfer and grant of the New Longleat Opco Lease**

If CP Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that it intends to arrange the transfer either
directly or indirectly by means of a surrender and re-grant of the Longleat Headlease Interest from Longleat Propco
to a new property-holding Obligor (a “Longleat Headlease Transfer”) and the grant of the Opco Lease between that
new Obligor and CP Opco (the “New Longleat Opco Lease”) in each case with the consent of the landlord, then
provided that CP Opco certifies that the provisions relating thereto in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with,
the Borrower Security Trustee must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice but subject to
the second paragraph of this covenant, at the cost of the Borrowers, sign and execute all such documents, instruments
and consents (including Land Registry forms) as are necessary or desirable in order to enable the transfer of the
Longleat Headlease Interest and the grant of the New Longleat Opco Lease as aforesaid.

In connection with the Longleat Headlease Transfer and the New Longleat Opco Lease, such new Obligor
must:

306


-----

(i) execute and deliver in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the
Borrower Secured Creditors a Longleat Legal Charge; and

(ii) provide the Borrower Security Trustee with a legal opinion (in a form satisfactory to the
Borrower Security Trustee) on the enforceability of the Longleat Legal Charge,

in each case, at the same time as any relevant release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee, and
provide, as soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of the Longleat Headlease Transfer, the Borrower
Security Trustee with a new certificate of title in industry standard form evidencing that that new Obligor is entitled
to be registered as the registered proprietor of the Longleat Headlease Interest and CP Opco is entitled to be registered
as the registered proprietor of the New Longleat Opco Lease, and the Borrower Security Trustee is entitled (but not
obliged) to be registered as the proprietor of the Longleat Legal Charge.

In connection with the grant of the New Longleat Opco Lease, CP Opco must execute and deliver in favour
of the Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the Borrower Secured Creditors a charge by way of legal mortgage
in respect of the New Longleat Opco Lease substantially in the form set out in the Borrower Deed of Charge at the
same time as any relevant release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee.

**Release of Designated Obligors**

If:

(i) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the Obligor Group
intends to wind up and ultimately dissolve some or all of the Designated Obligors; and

(ii) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the provisions
relating thereto as set out in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with,

then the Borrower Security Trustee must as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice, at the cost
of the Borrowers:

(A) release:

(I) all Liens granted by the relevant Designated Obligors under the
Borrower Security Documents; and

(II) all Liens granted in respect of any share capital of the relevant
Designated Obligors under the Borrower Security Documents; and

(B) irrevocably release and discharge the relevant Designated Obligors from all
liabilities which they may have under the Class B Finance Documents.

The above provisions may be utilised on more than one occasion in connection with different Designated
Obligors.

**Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisations**

If CP Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that, without prejudice to the Group’s
obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Obligor Group intends to enter into a transaction,
or a series of transactions, in connection with a sale of a Propco or a Propco’s interest in a Holiday Park (such
transaction or series of transactions, a “Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisation”) in each case with landlord consent
(where such consent is required), then the Borrower Security Trustee must as soon as reasonably practicable after the
receipt of such notice, at the cost of the Borrowers, provide all necessary consents, waivers and permissions (including
any release and simultaneous re-taking of security which may be required) which are necessary to enable such
Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisation to take place, but only to the extent that:

(i) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the provisions
relating thereto as set out in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with; and

(ii) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that any such release is
not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the position of the Borrower
Secured Creditors.

307


-----

The above provisions may be utilised on more than one occasion in connection with different Permitted PreSale Reorganisations.

**Permitted Post-Closing Reorganisations**

If CP Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that, without prejudice to the Group’s
obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Group intends to enter into a transaction, or a
series of transactions, as part of the reorganisation of the Group as envisaged in Section 14 of the Permitted PostClosing Reorganisation Paper (a “Permitted Post-Closing Reorganisation”), then the Borrower Security Trustee
must as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice, at the cost of the Borrowers, provide all
necessary consents, waivers and permissions (including any release and simultaneous re-taking of security which may
be required) which are necessary to enable the Permitted Post-Closing Reorganisations to take place, but only to the
extent that:

(i) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the provisions
relating thereto as set out in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with; and

(ii) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that any such release is
not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the position of the Borrower
Secured Creditors.

The above provisions may be utilised on more than one occasion in connection with different Permitted PostClosing Reorganisations.

**Woburn Headlease Transfer and grant of the Woburn Opco Lease**

If CP Woburn Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that it intends to arrange the
assignment of the Woburn Headlease from CP Woburn Opco to a new property-holding Obligor (a “Woburn
**Headlease Transfer”) and/or the grant of an Opco Lease between that new Obligor or CP Woburn Opco, as the case**
may be, and CP Opco (the “Woburn Opco Lease”) in each case with the consent of the landlord, then provided that
CP Woburn Opco certifies that the provisions relating thereto in the First Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant are

consents (including Land Registry forms) as are necessary or desirable in order to enable the transfer of the Woburn

Borrower Secured Creditors a mortgage over the relevant Property; and

Security Trustee with a new certificate of title in industry standard form evidencing that that new Obligor is entitled
to be registered as the registered proprietor of the Woburn Headlease and CP Opco is entitled to be registered as the
registered proprietor of the Woburn Opco Lease, and the Borrower Security Trustee is entitled (but not obliged) to be
registered as the proprietor of the Woburn Legal Charge.

Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the Borrower Secured Creditors a charge by way of legal mortgage in
respect of the Woburn Opco Lease substantially in the form set out in the Borrower Deed of Charge at the same time
as any relevant release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee.

your customer” or other similar identification procedures and in such circumstances where the necessary information
is not already available to it, the Obligor Group Agent shall promptly upon the request of the Borrower Security
Trustee supply, or procure the supply of, such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the
Borrower Security Trustee in order for it to carry out and be satisfied that it has complied with all the necessary “know
your customer” or similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to any relevant person pursuant
to the accession of such person to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement as an Additional Obligor or Additional

**Resignation of Obligors**

Any Borrower may request that a non-Material Obligor ceases to be an Obligor under the terms of the Class
B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement by giving to the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee a duly completed
Obligor Resignation Request.

The Borrower Security Trustee must accept an Obligor Resignation Request (in substantially the same form
as provided in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) and notify the Borrowers and the Issuer of its acceptance
if the conditions referred to in the Obligor Resignation Request are satisfied. The relevant Obligor will cease to be an
Obligor when the Borrower Security Trustee gives the notification.

**CLASS A DISCHARGE DATE**

The Obligors will not permit the Class A Discharge Date to occur unless the Issuer has received a Rating
Agency Confirmation in respect of the Class B Notes from S&P with respect thereto.

**CLASS A COVENANTS**

From the date on which a Share Enforcement Event also constitutes a Class B Loan Event of Default, the
general and property covenants set out in the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (the “Class A Covenants”)
shall be deemed to be incorporated into the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement mutatis mutandis as further
described below, until such time as the Issuer receives a Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P in relation to the
disapplication of the Class A Covenants.

Where the Class A Covenants are incorporated into the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement as
described above:

(a) capitalised terms used in the Class A Covenants shall have the same meaning and construction as
incorporated into the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, subject to paragraphs (b) to (e)
below;

(b) references to “Class A Loans”, “Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement”, “Class A IBLA” and
“Class A Notes” shall be deemed to be references to “Class B Loans”, “Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement”, “Class B IBLA” and “Class B Notes”, respectively;

(c) references to a “Class A Loan Event of Default” and “Class A Loan Potential Event of Default”
shall be deemed to be references to a “Class B Loan Event of Default” and a “Class B Loan Default”
respectively;

310


-----

(d) where a Class A Covenant (or a defined term referred to in a Class A Covenant) refers to both “Class
A” and “Class B”, the references to “Class B” shall be deemed to be deleted and the references to
“Class A” shall be deemed to be references to “Class B”;

(e) the Borrower Security Trustee shall have the power to enforce the Class A Covenants on behalf of
the Issuer and (indirectly) the Class B Noteholders as if the Class B Loan constituted a Class A Loan
on the terms of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement may be amended by the parties thereto in accordance with the
Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement from time to time without the consent of
the Class B Noteholders. To the extent any Class A Covenants are amended following the Ninth Closing Date, the
Class A Covenants incorporated into the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in the manner described above,
shall be the Class A Covenants as amended, restated or supplemented on the date of such incorporation into the Class
B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

If the Class A Covenants are amended following the Ninth Closing Date, the CP Opco shall notify the Issuer
and the Class B Note Trustee of such amendments, and the Issuer shall give notice to the Class B Noteholders in the
manner set out in the Class B Conditions.

**RELEASE OF LIENS**

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, liens on the Collateral securing the obligations under the Class B
Finance Documents (or if other Borrower Secured Liabilities remain outstanding, all claims of the Issuer in respect of
those Liens to the extent of its claims under the Class B Finance Documents) will be automatically and unconditionally
released:

(a) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on each Class B Loan under the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or discharge thereof;

(b) upon release of a Guarantee in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (with
respect to the Liens securing the assets, property and Capital Stock of the Guarantor that is released
from such Guarantee);

(c) in connection with any disposition of Collateral to any Person other than Topco or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (but excluding any transaction subject to the provisions described under “—
_Certain Covenants — Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” that is permitted by the Class B_
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (with respect to the Liens on such Collateral));

(d) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property
or assets to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) Topco or any
Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition that is not prohibited by, or does not otherwise
violate the provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement relating to asset sales;

(e) if Topco designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(f) as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(g) otherwise permitted under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

The Borrower Security Trustee will, subject to its receipt of an Officer’s certificate or opinion of counsel or
other documentation reasonably requested, take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral
securing the obligations under the Class B Finance Documents in accordance with the provisions of the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
relevant Borrower Security Documents. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Borrower Security
Trustee without the consent of the Issuer.

**DEFEASANCE**

The Borrowers may at any time terminate all obligations of the Borrowers and the Guarantors under the Class
B Loans and the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Share
Enforcement Events and Class B Loan Event of Defaults, except for certain obligations, including those respecting

311


-----

the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Borrower Security Trustee
and the obligations of the Borrowers in connection therewith. Subject to the foregoing, if the Borrowers exercise their
legal defeasance option, the Class B Finance Document and the rights of the Borrower Security Trustee and the Class
B Noteholders under the Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the
defeasance trust) in so far as they apply to the Class B Loans, the Class B Notes and the Class B Noteholders.

The Borrowers at any time may terminate their and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described
under “— _Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (i) and (ii) of the first paragraph of “—_ _Certain Covenants_ —
_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”) and “— Change B Change of Control” and the default provisions relating_
to such covenants described under “— Share Enforcement Event And Class B Loan Event Of Default”, the operation
of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect
to the Borrowers and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security
default provision described under “— _Share Enforcement Event And Class B Loan Event Of Default_ — _Share_
_Enforcement Event” (“covenant defeasance”)._

The Borrowers at their option at any time may exercise their legal defeasance option notwithstanding their
prior exercise of the covenant defeasance option. If the Borrowers exercises their legal defeasance option, payment of
the Class B Loans may not be accelerated because of a Share Enforcement Event or Class B Loan Event of Default
with respect to such Class B Loans and the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event would not give the right to
enforce the Topco Payment Undertakings and Topco Security. If the Borrowers exercise their covenant defeasance
option with respect to the Class B Loans, payment of the Class B Loans may not be accelerated because of a Share
Enforcement Event specified in clauses (vi) (other than with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) of the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “— _Certain Covenants_ — _Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”), (vii), (viii) (with_
respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (x), (xi) or (xii) under the first paragraph of “— Share Enforcement Event
_And Class B Loan Event Of Default — Share Enforcement Event”._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Borrowers must irrevocably deposit in trust by way of
security (the “defeasance trust”) with the Borrower Security Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as
agent by the Borrower Security Trustee for this purpose) cash in Sterling in an amount sufficient for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest, the applicable Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon on the relevant Class B Loans to maturity and must comply with certain other
conditions, including delivery to the Borrower Security Trustee of:

(a) an opinion of U.S. counsel to the effect that the lenders of the relevant Class B Loans will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such opinion of U.S. counsel must be based on
a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax
law);

(b) an Officer’s Certificate of each Borrower stating that the deposit was not made by the Borrowers
with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the
Borrowers;

(c) an Officer’s Certificate of each Borrower and an opinion of counsel (which opinion of counsel may
be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent
provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been
complied with;

(d) an opinion of U.S. counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute,
or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended; and

(e) all other documents or other information that the Borrower Security Trustee may reasonably require
in connection with either defeasance option.

**SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE**

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, and the rights of the Borrower Security Trustee, the Issuer
and the Class B Noteholders under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Borrower Security Documents, will be

312


-----

discharged and cease to be of further effect with respect to all outstanding Class B7 Loans when (1) (i) all of the Class
B7 Loans have become due and payable or (ii) all of the Class B7 Loans will become due and payable at the Class B7
Loan Expected Maturity Date or the Class B7 Loan Final Maturity Date, in each case within one year or (iii) all of the
Class B7 Loans are to be called for prepayment within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the
Borrower Security Trustee for the giving of notice of prepayment by the Borrowers; (2) the Borrowers have deposited
or caused to be deposited with the Borrower Security Trustee (or another entity designated by the Borrower Security
Trustee for this purpose), an amount in Sterling sufficient to pay and discharge the entire outstanding principal amount
on the Class B7 Loans, together with any prepayment premium, if any, accrued and unpaid interest, the Class B7 Loan
Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, to the date of deposit (in the case of
Class B7 Loans that have become due and payable), or to the Class B7 Loan Final Maturity Date, or prepayment date,
as the case may be; (3) the Borrowers have paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement with respect to the Class B7 Loans; (4) the Borrowers have delivered an irrevocable
notice of prepayment to the Borrower Security Trustee and have delivered irrevocable instructions to apply the funds
deposited towards the payment of the Class B7 Loans on the prepayment date; and (5) the Borrowers have delivered
to the Borrower Security Trustee an Officer’s Certificate of each Borrower (which the Borrower Security Trustee may
rely on without further inquiry) to the effect that all conditions precedent under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Class B7 Loans have been complied with.

**NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of Topco or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Topco, the Issuer or any Guarantor
under the Class B Finance Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or
their creation. Each Class B Noteholder by accepting a Class B Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver
and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Class B Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public
policy.

**GOVERNING LAW**

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Class B7 Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement will be
governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, English law.

In the event that Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurs, assumes, Guarantees, redeems, defeases, retires
or extinguishes any Financial Indebtedness (other than Financial Indebtedness Incurred under any revolving
credit facilities unless such Financial Indebtedness has been permanently repaid and has not been replaced)
or issues or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the period
for which the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is being calculated, but on or prior to the date on which the event
for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
**Calculation Date”), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to**
such Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, redemption, defeasance, retirement or extinguishment of Financial
Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period; _provided, however, that the_ _pro forma_
calculation of Fixed Charges shall not give effect to (i) any Financial Indebtedness Incurred on the date of
determination pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph under “— Certain Covenants —
_Limitation on Financial Indebtedness” (other than for the purpose of the calculation of the Fixed Charge_
Coverage Ratio under clause (v) thereunder) (but, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include any previously
Incurred Financial Indebtedness) or (ii) the discharge on the date of determination of any Financial
Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to the provisions

For the purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Investments, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, consolidations and disposed operations that have been made by Topco or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior
to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date, shall be calculated on a pro
_forma_ basis (including anticipated synergies and expenses and cost savings) assuming that all such
Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, consolidations and disposed or discontinued operations (and
the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had
occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person
that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into Topco or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition,
merger, consolidation or disposed or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant
to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto
for such period (including anticipated synergies and expenses and cost savings) as if such Investment,
acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period. Any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Fixed Charge Coverage
Calculation Date will be deemed to be a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such four-quarter period.
Any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Fixed Charge Coverage Calculation Date will be deemed
not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such four-quarter period.

calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of Topco

327


-----

(including any anticipated pro forma synergies and expenses and cost savings). If any Financial Indebtedness
bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Financial Indebtedness
shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the
applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Financial
Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalised Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate
reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of Topco to be the rate of interest
implicit in such Capitalised Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. For the purposes of making the
computation referred to above, interest on any Financial Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility
computed with a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Financial
Indebtedness during the applicable period, except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest
on Financial Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime
or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based
upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as Topco may designate.

reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described in “— Certain Covenants
— Class B Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as

Security Trustee by filing with the Borrower Security Trustee a resolution of the Board of Directors of

designation complies with the foregoing conditions.

If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary,
it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for the purposes of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement and any Financial Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred as of such date
and, if such Financial Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under “— _Certain_
_Covenants — Limitation on Financial Indebtedness”, Topco will be in default of such covenant._

Holdco shall be evidenced to the Borrower Security Trustee by promptly filing with the Borrower Security
Trustee a copy of the resolution of the Board of Directors of Intermediate Holdco giving effect to such

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Offered Notes sold to persons who are not U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S will be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Global
**Note”). The Global Note will be deposited on the Ninth Closing Date, with a common depositary and registered**
in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the account of Euroclear and Clearstream (each, a
“Clearing System”).

Ownership of interests in the Global Note (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that
have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through such participants.

Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Note on behalf of their respective participants
through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries.
Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive
certificated form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery
of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer
or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Offered Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry
Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Offered Notes for any purpose.

By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Global Note, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to represent,
among other things, that it is not a U.S. person, that it is located outside the United States and that, if it determines
to transfer such beneficial interest prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period (as such terms are
defined in Rules 902 and 903 of Regulation S), deemed to include the 40-day period after the commencement of
the offering of the Offered Notes or the Sixth Closing Date, whichever is later (the “distribution compliance
**period”), it will transfer such interest only to a person who is not a U.S. person in an offshore transaction in**
accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S, in each case in accordance with any applicable securities
laws of any state of the United States. See “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions”.

So long as the Offered Notes are held in global form, the common depositories for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable (or their respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Note
for all purposes under the Note Trust Deed governing the Offered Notes. In addition, participants must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear,
Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to
exercise any rights of holders of Offered Notes under the Note Trust Deed.

By acquiring an Offered Note (or any interest therein), each purchaser and transferee is deemed to
represent, warrant and agree, for so long as it holds such Offered Note (or any interest therein), that (a) either (1)
it is not, and is not acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan that is
subject to any Similar Law or (2) its acquisition, holding and disposition of the Offered Note (or any interest
therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code or a violation of any Similar Law, and (b) it will not sell or otherwise transfer the Offered Note
(or any interest therein) to any transferee that is a Benefit Plan Investor or any person acting on behalf of a Benefit
Plan Investor.

None of the Issuer, the Paying Agents, the Class B Registrar, the Class B Transfer Agent or the Class B
Note Trustee will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry
Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Note**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received
by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the
redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). Center Parcs
understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all the Offered Notes are
to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate;
_provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of £100,000 principal amount or less may be redeemed in part._

348


-----

**Payments on Global Note**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective
procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account
of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be
required by law and as described under the captions “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes — Taxes —
_Additional Amounts” in Annex A hereto. If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the_
extent described under the captions “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes — Taxes — Additional Amounts”
in Annex A hereto, as applicable, the Issuer will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or
withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such
Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects
that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of
Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Each payment in respect of any Global Note will be made to the person shown as the holder of a Global
Note at the close of business on the Clearing System Business Day (the “Global Note Record Date”) immediately
prior to the due date for payment where “Clearing System Business Day” means a day on which each Clearing
System for which the Global Note is being held is open for business.

Under the terms of the Note Trust Deed, the Issuer, the Class B Note Trustee, the Class B Registrar, the
Class B Transfer Agent and the relevant Paying Agent, will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (e.g.
Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Class B Note Trustee, the Class B
Registrar, the Class B Transfer Agent or any of their respective Paying Agents has or will have any responsibility
or liability for (1) any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing
the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on
account of, a Book-Entry Interest, (2) Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant or (3) the
records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Note**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Note will be paid to the holders of interests in such Offered Notes in pounds sterling.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by
a holder of Offered Notes (including the presentation of Offered Notes for exchange as described herein) only at
the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests are credited and only in respect
of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Offered Notes as to which such participant or participants has
or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Note. However, if there is an event of default
under the Note Trust Deed, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right, at the request of the holders of
the Offered Notes, to exchange the Global Note for definitive registered notes in certificated form (“Definitive
**Notes”) and to distribute Definitive Notes to its participants.**

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical
delivery of Definitive Notes for any reason, including to sell Offered Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require
physical delivery of securities or to pledge such Offered Notes, such holder must transfer its interests in the Global
Note in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the
procedures set out in the Note Trust Deed.

Each Global Note will have a legend to the effect set out under “Notice to Investors and Transfer
_Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and_
certification requirements discussed under “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions.” Transfers of BookEntry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Any Book-Entry Interest in a Global Note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first

349


-----

mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Notes**

Under the terms of the Note Trust Deed, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Notes
if:

      - the Issuer has been notified that Euroclear or Clearstream have been closed for business for a
continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, whether statutory or otherwise)
or have announced an intention permanently to cease business or have in fact done so and, in
any such case, no successor clearing system satisfactory to the Class B Note Trustee is available;
or

      - the Issuer has or will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would not be suffered
were the Offered Note represented by the Global Note in definitive form.

In such an event, the Class B Registrar will issue Definitive Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, requested by or on behalf
of Euroclear, Clearstream or the Issuer (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such
Definitive Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Note Trust Deed, unless that legend is not
required by such Note Trust Deed or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Class B Note Trustee, the Class B Transfer Agent, any
Paying Agent and the Class B Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the
absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the
Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and
such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Offered Notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Offered Notes; however, owners of
the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts
in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. Center Parcs provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint
Bookrunners, the Paying Agents, the Class B Transfer Agent or the Class B Registrar is responsible for those
operations or procedures.

Center Parcs understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and
Clearstream hold securities for participating organisations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping,
administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and
Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial
institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other
organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream
participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who, in turn, act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Offered Notes represented by the Global Note are expected to be listed and admitted for trading on
the Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Note between participants in Euroclear and
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

350


-----

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Note among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they
are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Obligors, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint
Bookrunners, the Class B Note Trustee or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by
Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations
under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Offered Notes will be made in pounds sterling. Book-Entry Interests owned
through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional notes
in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement
date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**TAXATION**

_If you are a prospective investor, you should consult your tax advisor on the possible tax consequences_
_of buying, holding or selling the Offered Notes under the laws of your country of citizenship, residence or domicile,_
_including the effect of any local taxes applicable to you. The discussions that follow do not purport to be a_
_comprehensive description of all tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or sell_
_the Offered Notes. In particular, these discussions do not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may_
_apply to you. The discussions that follow for each jurisdiction are based upon the applicable laws and_
_interpretations thereof as in effect as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. These tax laws and interpretations_
_are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect._

**United Kingdom Taxation**

The following applies only to persons who are the beneficial owners of the Offered Notes and is a
summary of the Issuer’s understanding of current United Kingdom law and HMRC published practice in the United
Kingdom relating only to United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments of interest on the Offered Notes.
The following is not exhaustive and does not deal with any other United Kingdom taxation implications of
acquiring, holding or disposing of the Offered Notes. The United Kingdom tax treatment of prospective
Noteholders depends on their individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. Prospective
Noteholders who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom or who may be unsure as
to their tax position should seek their own professional advice.

**_Payment of Interest on the Offered Notes_**

Payments of interest on the Offered Notes may be made without deduction of or withholding on account
of United Kingdom income tax provided that the Offered Notes are and continue to be listed on a “recognised
stock exchange” within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The International Stock
Exchange is a recognised stock exchange. The Offered Notes will satisfy this requirement if they are officially
listed in Guernsey in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in EEA states and
are admitted to trading on the International Stock Exchange. Provided, therefore, that the Offered Notes are and
remain so listed, interest on the Offered Notes will be payable without withholding or deduction on account of
United Kingdom tax.

In other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Offered Notes that
have a UK source on account of United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), subject to any
available exemptions and reliefs. However, where an applicable double tax treaty provides for a lower rate of
withholding tax (or for no tax to be withheld) in relation to a Noteholder, HMRC can issue a notice to the Issuer
to pay interest to the Noteholder without deduction of tax (or for the interest to be paid with tax deducted at the
rate provided for in the relevant double tax treaty).

The references to “interest” in this United Kingdom Taxation section means “interest” as that term is
understood for United Kingdom tax purposes, and in particular any premium element of the redemption amount
of any Notes redeemable at a premium may constitute a payment of interest subject to the withholding tax
provisions discussed above. In certain cases, the same could be true for amounts of discount where Notes are issued
at a discount. The statements above do not take any account of any different definitions of “interest” or “principal”
which may prevail under any other law or which may be created by the terms and conditions of the Notes or any
related documentation.

**Certain Jersey taxation considerations**

The following summary of the anticipated treatment of the Issuer and holders of the Offered Notes (other
than residents of Jersey) is based on Jersey taxation law and practice as they are understood to apply at the date of
this document and is subject to changes in such taxation law and practice. It does not constitute legal or tax advice
and does not address all aspects of Jersey tax law and practice. Prospective investors in the Offered Notes should
consult their professional advisers on the implications of acquiring, buying, selling or otherwise disposing of the
Offered Notes under the laws of any jurisdiction in which they may be liable to taxation.

**_Taxation of the Issuer_**

The Issuer is not regarded as resident for tax purposes in Jersey. Therefore, the Issuer will not be liable
to Jersey income tax other than on Jersey source income (except where such income is exempted from income tax
pursuant to the Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961, as amended) and payments in respect of the Offered Notes may be
paid by the Issuer without withholding or deduction for or on account of Jersey income tax. The holders of the
Offered Notes (other than residents of Jersey) will not be subject to any tax in Jersey in respect of the holding, sale
or other disposition of such Offered Notes.

352


-----

**_Stamp Duty_**

In Jersey, no stamp duty is levied on the issue or transfer of the Offered Notes except that stamp duty is
payable on Jersey grants of probate and letters of administration, which will generally be required to transfer the
Offered Notes on the death of a holder of such Offered Notes where such Offered Notes are situated in Jersey. In
the case of a grant of probate or letters of administration, stamp duty is levied according to the size of the estate
(wherever situated in respect of a holder of Offered Notes domiciled in Jersey, or situated in Jersey in respect of a
holder of Offered Notes domiciled outside Jersey) and is payable on a sliding scale at a rate of up to 0.75% of such
estate and such duty is capped at £100,000. Where the Offered Notes are in registered form and the register is not
maintained in Jersey such Offered Notes should not be considered to be situated in Jersey for these purposes.

Jersey does not otherwise levy taxes upon capital, inheritances, capital gains or gifts nor are there other
estate duties.

**The proposed financial transaction tax**

On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”)
for a Directive for a common financial transaction tax (“FTT”) in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain,
France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (each, other than Estonia, a “participating Member
**State”). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.**

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in
the Offered Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Primary market transactions
referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 are expected to be exempt.

Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within
and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Offered Notes
where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member
State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member State in a broad
range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or
(b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States. It
may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member
States may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of the Offered Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to
the FTT.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of Offered
Notes by (i) “employee benefit plans” as defined in Section 3(3) of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), that are subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) “plans” (including individual
retirement accounts) as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), (iii) entities whose underlying assets include the assets of any such employee benefit plan
subject to Title I of ERISA or other plan subject to Section 4975 of the Code (each of (i)-(iii), an “ERISA Plan”),
and (iv) governmental plans as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA, certain church plans as defined in Section 3(33)
of ERISA and non-U.S. plans as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA that, while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, may be subject to other federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations that are
substantially similar to the provisions of Title I of ERISA, Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
(“Similar Law”) (together with any ERISA Plan, a “Plan”). This summary is general in nature and is not intended
to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons
involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons
considering purchasing the Offered Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their own
counsel to determine whether such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will violate Title I of ERISA,
Section 406 of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or any Similar Law.

**General Fiduciary Considerations**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan subject to
Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA
Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who has or exercises
any discretionary authority or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition
of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect,
to an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

When considering an investment in the Offered Notes with the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and
the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Law relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan
including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction
provisions of Section 406 of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Law.

**Prohibited Transaction Considerations**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a
statutory or administrative exemption or exception is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or
disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other
penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

The acquisition or holding of the Offered Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, Center
Parcs or any of their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) are considered a party in interest or a
disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of
ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an
applicable statutory or administrative exemption or exception. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor (the
“DOL”) has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and
holding of the Offered Notes. These exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments
by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by an “independent qualified
professional asset manager”), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by an insurance company general account),
PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager) and PTCE 90-1 (relating to
investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts). In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code could provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and non-fiduciary service
providers to the ERISA Plan; provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or
indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to
the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no more
than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that any of the PTCEs
or any other exemption or exception will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the
Offered Notes, or that, if any of the PTCEs or another exemption or exception is available, it will cover all aspects
of any particular transaction. Prospective investors should consult with their advisors regarding the prohibited
transaction rules and these exemptions.

354


-----

Because of the foregoing, the Offered Notes (and interests therein) should not be acquired, held or
disposed of by any Plan or any person acting on behalf of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and disposition
would not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code or a violation of any Similar Law. Any purported purchase, transfer, holding or disposition in violation
of these limitations will be void. If such purchase, transfer, holding or disposition is not treated as being void for
any reason, the Offered Notes will automatically be transferred to a charitable trust for the benefit of a charitable
beneficiary and the Plan will acquire no right in the Offered Notes.

**Plan Asset Considerations**

Regulations promulgated under ERISA by the DOL at 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by
Section 3(42) of ERISA (together, the “Plan Asset Regulations”), provide that when an ERISA Plan acquires an
“equity interest” in an entity that is neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment
company registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”), the
ERISA Plan’s assets include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of
the entity unless it is established either that equity participation in the entity by “benefit plan investors” is not
“significant” or that the entity is an “operating company,” in each case as defined in the Plan Asset Regulations.
For purposes of the Plan Asset Regulations, equity participation in an entity by benefit plan investors will not be
significant if benefit plan investors hold, in the aggregate, less than 25% of the total value of each class of equity
interests of such entity, excluding equity interests held by any person (other than a benefit plan investor) who has
discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the entity or who provides investment advice for a
fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets, and any “affiliates” (as defined in the Plan Asset Regulations)
of such person. For purposes of this 25% test, “benefit plan investors” include (i) any “employee benefit plan” (as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA, (ii) any
“plan” (as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code) to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, or (iii) any entity
whose underlying assets include, or are deemed for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code to include,
“plan assets” by reason of an employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in the entity under the Plan Asset
Regulations (each, a “Benefit Plan Investor”), but exclude governmental, church and non-U.S. plans.

While the discussion under “Taxation” assumes that the Offered Notes will be treated as debt for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, such characterisation is not entirely clear, and no assurances can be given that the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service would not assert, or that a court would not uphold, a different characterisation of
the Offered Notes. In addition, it is anticipated that (i) the Offered Notes will not constitute “publicly offered
securities” for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulations and (ii) the Issuer will not be an investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act.

If the Issuer’s assets were deemed to be “plan assets” of an ERISA Plan holding the Offered Notes, this
would result in, among other things, (i) the application of the prudence and other fiduciary responsibility standards
of ERISA to investments made by the Issuer, and (ii) the possibility that certain transactions that the Issuer might
enter into, or may have entered into, in the ordinary course of business might constitute or result in non-exempt
prohibited transactions under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code and might have to be
rescinded.

**Representations and Covenants**

Accordingly, each purchaser and holder of the Offered Notes (or any interest therein) will be deemed to
have represented, warranted and agreed, for so long as it holds such Offered Notes (or any interest therein), that
(A) either (i) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor or a governmental, church or non-U.S.
plan that is subject to any Similar Law, or (ii) its acquisition, holding and disposition of the Offered Notes (or any
interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any Similar Law, and (B) it will not sell or otherwise transfer the
Offered Notes (or any interest therein) to any transferee that is a Benefit Plan Investor or any person acting on
behalf of a Benefit Plan Investor.

Any purported purchase, transfer, holding or disposition in violation of these representations will be void.
If such purchase, transfer, holding or disposition is not treated as being void for any reason, the Offered Notes will
automatically be transferred to a charitable trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and the purported holder
will acquire no right in the Offered Notes.

Each purchaser and holder of the Offered Notes (or any interest therein) that is, or is acting on behalf of,
a Benefit Plan Investor, will be further deemed to have represented, warranted and agreed that (i) none of the
Transaction Parties has provided any investment recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any
fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Benefit Plan Investor (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied as a
primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in the Offered Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking
to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the Benefit Plan
Investor or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the Benefit Plan Investor’s acquisition of the Offered Notes, and

355


-----

(ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Offered
Notes.

**LIMITATION ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the security interests_
_in each of the jurisdictions in which collateral is being provided. It is a summary only and does not purport to be_
_complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity or enforceability of the_
_obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor. The laws of more than one jurisdiction could potentially apply in respect_
_of certain matters which could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect_
_your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Offered Notes and the security interests on_
_the collateral. Prospective investors in the Offered Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to all_
_such limitations and considerations._

_In the event that the Issuer, any Guarantor or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is_
_not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be_
_commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the_
_obligations of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the collateral provided by any other company. The insolvency,_
_administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organised or operate may be_
_materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the_
_potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another._

**Jersey Insolvency**

The Issuer and one of the Obligors is incorporated under the laws of Jersey. In the event of an insolvency
of the Issuer or the Jersey Obligor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There are two principal
regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: "désastre" and "creditors' winding up".

The "désastre" procedure in respect of a Jersey company may be instigated by the Jersey Financial
Services Commission, an eligible creditor or the company making an application for an Act of the Royal Court of
Jersey (the "Royal Court") under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the "Jersey
**Bankruptcy Law") declaring the property of a debtor to be "en désastre" (a "declaration"). On a declaration of**
"désastre", title and possession of the property of the debtor vest automatically in the Viscount, an official of the
Royal Court (the "Viscount"). With effect from the date of the declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against
the property or person of the debtor in respect of the debt, and may not commence or, except with the consent of
the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any action or legal proceedings to recover the debt.

There are two forms of "creditors' winding up" available in respect of a Jersey company pursuant to the
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the "Jersey Companies Law"): (a) a court ordered procedure (a "court
**ordered creditors' winding up") which is instigated by an eligible creditor of the company making an application**
for an order of the Royal Court to commence a creditors' winding up; and (b) a voluntary procedure (a "non-court
**ordered creditors' winding up") which is instigated by a special resolution of the shareholders of the company.**
On a creditors' winding up, a liquidator is nominated, by the applying creditor (in the case of a court ordered
creditors' winding up) or the shareholders (in the case of a non-court ordered creditors' winding up). The court (in
the case of a court ordered creditors' winding up) or the creditors (in the case of a non-court ordered creditors'
winding up) may approve such a liquidator or appoint a different liquidator. In the case of a court ordered creditors'
winding up, the Royal Court may also appoint a provisional liquidator in the intervening period between the initial
application and the order to commence the creditors' winding up. In the case of a court ordered creditors' winding
up, the liquidator (including any liquidator appointed provisionally) must, within seven days of their appointment,
give known creditors notice calling a creditors' meeting to be held 21 days' after the date of the relevant order of the
Royal Court and, in the case of a non-court ordered creditors' winding up, the shareholders must give creditors 14
days' notice of the meeting to commence the creditors' winding up, with a meeting of creditors' to be held
immediately following such commencement meeting. Any liquidator appointed provisionally will carry out such
functions as conferred by, and may have their powers limited by, the Royal Court. Once the creditors' winding up
has commenced, the liquidator will stand in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding up, gather assets,
make appropriate disposals of assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate. After the appointment of a
liquidator provisionally or the commencement of the creditors' winding up, no action can be taken or proceeded
with against the company except with the leave of. the Royal Court The corporate state and capacity of the company
continues until the end of the winding up procedure, when the company is dissolved.

357


-----

The Jersey Companies Law requires a creditor of a company (subject to appeal) to be bound by an
arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors immediately before or in the course of its creditors'
winding up if (among other things) three quarters in number and value of the creditors acceded to the arrangement.

**_Compromises and arrangements with creditors_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, under Article 125 of the Jersey Companies Law the Royal Court may
sanction a compromise or arrangement (a "scheme of arrangement") between a Jersey company and its creditors
or shareholders (or a class of either of them). The Royal Court may, on application of the company (or a creditor
or shareholder or, if the company is being wound up, a liquidator) order a meeting to be called at which the
proposed scheme of arrangement must be agreed to by a majority in number representing:

    - 75% in value of the creditors (or class of creditors); or

    - 75% of the voting rights of the shareholders (or class of shareholders),

as the case may be, present and voting either in person or by proxy before the Royal Court considers the sanction
of the scheme of arrangement. If the requisite majority of creditors or shareholders (or of the relevant class of
either of them) agree to the scheme of arrangement and, following such agreement, the Royal Court sanctions the
scheme of arrangement, the scheme of arrangement is binding on all creditors or shareholders (or on the relevant
class of either of them) and on the company (or any liquidator and contributories of the company if the company
is being wound up).

**_Transactions at an undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law, the Royal
Court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en
_désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction (including any guarantee or_
security interest) entered into by a company with any person (the “other party”) at an undervalue. There is a fiveyear look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which
transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law
and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what
constitutes a transaction at an undervalue, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into such a
transaction with a person connected with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Preferences_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law, the
Royal Court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared
“en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a preference (including any guarantee
or security interest) given by the company to any person (the “other party”). There is a 12-month look-back period
from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are
susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey
Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a
preference, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into a preference with a person connected
with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Extortionate transactions, onerous property, disclaimer and customary law fraudulent_** **_dispositions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Jersey Companies Law, the Royal
Court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en
_désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction providing credit to the debtor_
company which is or was extortionate. There is a three-year look-back period from the date of commencement of
the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to
this rule. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without
limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction which is extortionate.

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the date of
the declaration of "désastre " and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may within six
months following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous property of the company.

358


-----

“Onerous property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract lease or other immoveable property if
it is situated outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it might give rise to a liability
to pay money or perform any other onerous act, and includes an unprofitable contract.

A disclaimer operates to determine, as from the date it is made, the rights, interests and liabilities of the
company/debtor in or in respect of the property disclaimed and discharges the company/Viscount from all liability
in respect of the property as of the date of the commencement of the creditors’ winding up/from the date of the
declaration but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company/debtor, debtor's
property and the Viscount from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. A person sustaining
loss or damage as a result of a disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or
damage and shall have standing as a creditor in the "désastre " or creditors’ winding up. The Jersey Bankruptcy
Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) in relation to the power
to disclaim onerous property.

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey
customary law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention of defeating
creditors’ claims may be set aside.

**_Enforcement of security and security in insolvency_**

Under the laws of Jersey, a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey is deemed to have capacity
to grant security governed by foreign law over property situated outside Jersey, but to the extent that any floating
charge or other security interest governed by a foreign law is expressed to apply to any asset, property and
undertaking of a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey such floating charge or other security interest
is not likely to be held valid and enforceable by the Jersey courts in respect of Jersey situs assets.

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the
Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators are not
part of the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Jersey courts may not recognise the powers of an administrator,
administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets.

The Royal Court (in its inherent jurisdiction) may, however, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy
Law assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories and, applying general principles of comity, assist the
courts in other jurisdictions, in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Royal Court
thinks fit. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the
model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey.

If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in another jurisdiction in relation to a Jersey company,
the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting country's
insolvency regime.

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should be noted that the
UNCITRAL provisions will not automatically be followed as this is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court.
The Royal Court's position may also not be in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation. Jersey does not
form part of the European Community for the purposes of implementation of its directions. Accordingly, the EU
Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and the automatic test of centre of main
interests does not apply.

Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, re-organisation or other laws of general application relating to or affecting
the rights of creditors, and laws in relation to transactions at an undervalue, preferences, extortionate credit
transactions, disclaimer of onerous property and fraudulent dispositions also apply in Jersey (as detailed above).

-----

Insolvency or bankruptcy alone will not render such security interest invalid or non-binding on the parties
thereto or any liquidator of a Jersey company or the Viscount in a désastre of a Jersey company’s property. This is
subject to certain statutory exceptions, which include (but are not limited to):

The Jersey Companies Law provides that after the appointment of a liquidator provisionally or the
commencement of the creditors' winding up, no action can be taken or proceeded with against the company except
with the leave of the Royal Court; and

Article 10(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law provides that with effect from the date of a declaration of
_désastre against a person (the “bankrupt”), a creditor shall not have any other remedy against the property or person_
of the bankrupt or commence or (except with the consent of the Viscount or by order of the court) continue any
action or legal proceedings to recover such creditor’s debt; and

Generally a transfer of shares in a Jersey company, not being a transfer made to or with the sanction of the
liquidator of the company in a creditors’ winding up (insolvent winding up) under the Jersey Companies Law, or the
Viscount after the property of the company is declared to be en désastre under the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, and an
alteration in the status of the company’s members made after the commencement of the creditors’ winding up or
after such declaration of en désastre, is void.

In the enforcement of foreign security in Jersey, the Courts of Jersey — properly applying the relevant
provisions of foreign law — are likely to uphold (subject to the comments above) a claim that the relevant security interest
(and other than in respect of any property or assets situated or deemed to be situated in Jersey) is binding on a Jersey
company and any liquidator or other similar person having control of the assets of a Jersey company.

**Cayman Islands Insolvency**

The Topco Obligors are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Accordingly, any insolvency
proceedings with respect to the Topco Obligors are likely to be pursuant to the Companies Act and the Companies
Winding Up Rules (2023 Consolidation) of the Cayman Islands.

Under Cayman Islands law, insolvency proceedings may involve the appointment of a liquidator whose
function it is to act as the agent of the company in order to: (i) realise the company’s assets; (ii) identify the company’s
creditors and the amounts of their claims; and (iii) distribute the proceeds of realisation of the company’s assets (net
of expenses and claims of secured and/or preferred creditors) to the company’s unsecured creditors pro rata and, after
the creditors have been paid in full, to distribute the remaining balance (if any) to the company’s shareholders.

Cayman Islands legislation provides for three different procedural systems for winding up companies,
namely: (i) compulsory winding up by order of the Court; (ii) voluntary winding up initiated by, for example, a
resolution of the shareholders or in accordance with the provisions of the company’s articles of association; and (iii)
voluntary winding up originally initiated by, for example, a resolution of the shareholders that is subsequently made
subject to the supervision of the Court. The Court an also appoint a provisional liquidator after the presentation of a
winding up petition but before a winding up order is made where, for example, there is a prima facie case for making
a winding up order but there is an immediately need for the appointment of a provisional liquidator to take certain
safeguarding actions, such as: to prevent the dissipation or misuse or the company's assets, to prevent the oppression
of minority shareholders in the company, or to prevent the mismanagement or misconduct on the party of the
company's directors.

As an alternative to winding up proceedings, the Companies Act was amended in 2022 to allow a company
to restructure under the supervision of a restructuring officer appointed by the Court (including on an interim basis,
on such terms and conditions seen fit by the Court) on the application of the company, in circumstances where the
company is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts and it intends to present a compromise or arrangement with
its creditors (for example, where the restructuring of the company’s debts is sought to be achieved by way of a foreign
proceeding such as a proceeding under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a consensual deal with creditors or a
Cayman Islands scheme of arrangement).

A winding up petition may be presented to the Court by, amongst others, the company itself or a creditor
(including a contingent or prospective creditor) or a shareholder of the company. A winding up order is usually sought

EUROPE LEGAL 288904189/4 166017 0014/4 166017 0014 360


-----

on the basis that the company is unable to pay its debts, or because it is otherwise just and equitable to make a winding
up order. When considering the inability of the company to pay debts, Cayman Islands law requires that the Court
have regard to the company’s cash-flow position, but whether the company is balance sheet insolvent may also be
relevant.

Following the presentation of a petition for the appointment of a restructuring officer (which petition has not
been withdrawn or dismissed) or when an order for the appointment of a restructuring officer is made, when a winding
up order is made or a provisional liquidator is appointed by the Court, an automatic moratorium on proceedings (other
than criminal proceedings) against the company is imposed and proceedings may not be commenced or continued
against the company except with the express permission of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court may
impose. The moratorium does not affect any valid contractual rights of set-off or subordination agreements acquired
or entered into before the commencement of the liquidation. A secured creditor is entitled to enforce his security
without the leave of the Court and without reference to the liquidator or restructuring officer (as applicable).

Following the making of a winding up order, dispositions of property, transfers of shares and alterations in
the status of shareholders made after the presentation of the petition for winding up are void unless approved by the
Court.

It is a fundamental rule of Cayman Islands insolvency law that all ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated
creditors are treated equally irrespective of the nature of their claims. This is referred to as the pari passu rule. Local
creditors (save in certain cases for a minimal category of statutorily preferred creditors, including statutory fees and
very limited amounts owed to Cayman Islands employees) do not have any preference or priority over foreign
creditors. This rule applies in relation to ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated creditors existing as at the date of the
presentation of the winding-up petition, or whose claims arise out of causes of action that accrued before the date of
the presentation of the winding-up petition. These will include creditors whose claims against the company arise out
of contract, common law and statutory torts, equitable claims, etc. Generally speaking, a creditor having a validly
created security interest over property of a company in liquidation is entitled to enforce his security without reference
to the official liquidators or restructuring officer (as applicable) and without the leave of the Court.

As set out in greater detail below, preferred creditors under Cayman Islands law will rank ahead of unsecured
creditors of a company. Preferred creditors under the Companies Act will rank ahead of unsecured creditors and
secured creditors where the secured creditors’ security is in the nature of a floating charge. Furthermore, all costs,
charges and expenses properly incurred in the winding up of a company, including the remuneration of the liquidators,
are payable out of the assets of the company in priority to all other unsecured claims.

Enforcement against a Cayman Islands company may be limited by section 86 and/or section 91I of the
Companies Act which provides that a compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors or any class
of them shall, if sanctioned by the Court, be binding on all the creditors or any class of creditors. If there are creditors
who form a class, the class will be bound by the scheme if a majority in number representing 75% in value of the
creditors or class of creditors who attended and voted (whether in person or by proxy), approved the scheme. Cayman
Islands authority suggests that a class is constituted by “those persons whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it
impossible for them to consult together with a view to their acting in their common interest.” Two or more creditors
are likely to constitute separate classes in a compromise or arrangement if they hold security over different assets or
hold security over the same asset but do not rank equally (see “Scheme of Arrangement” below).

Enforcement may be limited by Section 99 of the Companies Act which provides that, when a winding up
order has been made, any disposition of the company’s property and any transfer of shares or alteration in the status
of the company’s members made after the commencement of the winding up (such as where a winding up petition has
been presented) is, unless the Court otherwise orders, void.

Section 97 of the Companies Act provides:

(i) “when a winding up order is made or a provisional liquidator is appointed no suit, action or other
proceedings, other than criminal proceedings, shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company except
with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court may impose"; and

(ii) "when a winding up order has been made, any attachment, distress or execution put in force against the
estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the winding up is void.”

361


-----

However, Section 142(1) of the Companies Act confirms that, notwithstanding that a winding up order has
been made, a creditor who has security over the whole or part of the assets of a company is entitled to enforce his
security without the leave of the Court and without reference to the liquidator.

It should also be noted that Section 96 of the Companies Act provides that the Court may upon an application
from the company or any creditor of contributory at any time after the presentation of the petition for the winding up
of a company and before the making of a winding up order, where any action or proceedings are pending in a summary
court, the Court, the Court of Appeal, the Privy Council or in a foreign court, restrain such proceedings accordingly
“on such terms as [the court] thinks fit.” In practice, the scope and effect of the stay under Section 96 is the same as
Section 97.

A liquidator may at any time give notice to a creditor whose debt is secured that he proposes, at the expiration
of 28 days from the date of the notice, to redeem the security at the value put upon it in the creditor’s proof.

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

Section 86 and section 87 of the Companies Act provides for the approval of schemes of arrangement,
compromise and reconstruction agreed between a company and its members or a company and its creditors. The
application can be made by the company, a creditor or, if the company is in liquidation, by the liquidator. There is no
statutory obligation on a company or its directors to propose a scheme of arrangement. Similarly, sections 91I and 91J
of the Companies Act for the approval of schemes of arrangement, compromise or reconstruction agreed between a
company and its members or a company and its creditors on the application of a restructuring officer.

Before the Court considers whether or not to sanction a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote
on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes,
depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such
creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by, among others, the company or its
creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the
meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approved
thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the Court) be binding
on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted
against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the Court at a sanction hearing where the Court will
review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The Court has discretion as to whether to
sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made to the scheme or reject
the scheme.

**_Priority of claims on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of liquidation under Cayman Islands law is to realise the assets of the insolvent
company and to distribute the cash realisations made from those assets to its creditors. Under Cayman Islands
insolvency law, creditors are placed into different classes and the proceeds from the realisation of the insolvent
company’s property is applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. Distributions generally cannot be
made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless
creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in
proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

(a) First, in satisfaction of the rights of fixed charge creditors (although such assets are, strictly
speaking, outside of the liquidation) (Section 140(2) of the Companies Act);

(b) Secondly, in satisfaction of the claims of preferred creditors (to the extent that there are insufficient
assets to make payment of all preferential debts) (Section 140(2) of the Companies Act);

(c) Thirdly, in satisfaction of the claims of floating charge creditors (Section 140(2), Section 141(1) of
the Companies Act);

(d) Fourthly, in satisfaction of the provable debts of the unsecured creditors of the company (but having
regard to priority where a creditor is subordinated to other creditors) (Section 140(1) of the
Companies Act);

(e) Fifthly, in paying statutory interest on the proved debts (Section 149(2) of the Companies Act); and

362


-----

(f) Sixthly, distribution of surplus assets to shareholders in accordance with their rights and interests.

There are circumstances under Cayman Islands law in which the granting by a Cayman Islands company of
security can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company becomes insolvent or is placed into
liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) following the granting of the security.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under Cayman Islands law in respects of Cayman
Islands law governed security interests:

**_Voidable preferences_**

Pursuant to Section 145 of the Companies Act, a transaction will constitute a voidable preference in the
following circumstances:

(i) a conveyance or transfer of property (or charge thereon) or payment obligation was made,
incurred, taken or suffered by the relevant company in favour of a creditor within 6 months
immediately preceding the commencement of liquidation of the company;

(ii) at the time when the conveyance or transfer of property or payment obligation was made,
incurred, taken or suffered, the company was insolvent (that is, unable to pay its debts);
and

(iii) the conveyance or transfer of property or payment obligation was made, incurred, taken or
suffered with a view to giving the creditor a preference over other creditors. Please note
that if the creditor is a “related party” (that is, an entity who has the ability to control the
relevant company or exercise significant influence over the relevant company in making
financial and operating decisions), the transfer of property or payment obligation will be
deemed to have been made with a view to giving such a creditor a preference.

If the above criteria can be satisfied with respect to the transfer of property or payment obligation, the
transaction will be voidable upon the application of the liquidator and the liquidator may be able to claw back the
property or payment transferred.

**_Fraudulent dispositions_**

Under the Fraudulent Dispositions Act (1996 Revision) (the “Fraudulent Dispositions Act”) (in respect of
creditor actions) and pursuant to Section 146 of the Companies Act (in respect of liquidator actions), a transaction will
constitute a disposition at an undervalue in the following circumstances:

(iv) a disposition (being any type of transfer, conveyance, assignment, lease, mortgage, pledge
or other transaction by which any legal or equitable interest in property is created,
transferred or extinguished) of property is made;

(v) the disposition was made by the relevant company at an undervalue (which means for no
consideration or for consideration the value of which in money or monies worth is
significantly less than the value of the property the subject of the disposition); and

(vi) the disposition was made with an intent to defraud its creditors (that is, an intention to
wilfully defeat an obligation or liability (which includes a contingent liability) owed to a
creditor which existed on or prior to the date of the disposition).

If the above criteria can be satisfied with respect to the disposition of property, the disposition shall be
voidable at the instance of the liquidator (under Section 146 of the Companies Act) and/or by the creditor thereby
prejudiced (under the Fraudulent Dispositions Act). No action or proceeding can be commenced by a liquidator or
creditor seeking to establish that a disposition of property constituted a disposition made at an undervalue more than
6 years after the date of disposition. The burden of establishing the intent to defraud lies with the official liquidator
and/or the creditor (as applicable).

**_Fraudulent trading_**

Pursuant to Section 147 of the Companies Act, if in the course of winding up of the company it appears that
any business of the company has been carried on with an intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of
any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the liquidator may apply to the Court to make such orders as it thinks
fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the

363


-----

interests of the victims of the transaction. It is notable that this form of order does not involve the imposition of liability
for the company’s debts as such, but enables the Court to form a judgment as to the extent to which it is appropriate
to require each participant in a company’s fraudulent trading to contribute personally to the assets, so as to augment
the funds available for distribution to unpaid creditors/members (as applicable). Section 147 of the Companies Act
uses the term “persons” which enables liability to be imposed upon a wider circle of participants in any such activity
than merely directors and officers. It should be noted further that Section 147 of the Companies Act imposes no
restrictions in terms of the period of time prior to the company’s winding up during which the events must have taken
place in order for liability to be imposed.

An application seeking this type of relief is brought by a liquidator for the benefit of the company’s estate as
a whole and not merely for the benefit of individual creditors (in an insolvent liquidation) or individual members (in
a solvent liquidation).

**_Constructive trusts_**

A liquidator may cause the company to commence a proceeding against the directors of the company for
breach of fiduciary duty where, for example, the company (by its directors) knowingly divests itself of an asset at an
undervalue in breach of the directors’ duty to act in the best interests of the company. If the recipient of the asset knew
he/she/it was receiving it as a result of a breach of fiduciary duty, the Court may determine that the asset should be
impressed with a constructive trust such that the recipient will be deemed to be holding the asset on trust for the
company.

**_Equitable nature of mortgage over shares_**

The mortgage created by Topco over the shares of CP Cayman Limited to secure the obligations of Topco
under the Topco Payment Undertaking is governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands and comprises an equitable not
a legal mortgage. An equitable mortgage has certain disadvantages compared with a legal mortgage, including the fact
that an earlier security will have priority and a subsequent third party purchaser for value or legal mortgagee of the
shares mortgaged, who does not have notice of the equitable mortgage, will not be subject to it. The Court will not
recognise or enforce foreclosure (meaning the assumption by the mortgagee of beneficial ownership of the mortgaged
property and the extinction of the mortgagor’s equity of redemption therein) against the shares mortgaged pursuant to
the mortgage over the shares in CP Cayman Limited in the absence of foreclosure proceedings against Topco in the
Court, or a judgment in respect of foreclosure proceedings against Topco in the courts of another jurisdiction which
the Court is prepared to enforce in accordance with the usual principles applicable to the enforcement of foreign
judgments in the Cayman Islands.

**_Registration of security_**

The Cayman Islands does not have a central public filing system for registration of mortgages and charges
granted by Cayman Islands companies or relating to assets held by a Cayman Islands company (save for ships, planes
and intellectual property and land registered in the Cayman Islands and some other asset classes which would not
appear relevant to the current transaction). Where a security interest is created by a company (regardless of where the
asset is located), it is necessary under the Companies Act to enter any security interest granted by the company in the
register of mortgages and charges of the company (maintained by the company at its registered office in the Cayman
Islands) (the “ROMC”), although failure to make such a registration is a technical breach of the Companies Act and
from a Cayman perspective such failure would not adversely impact the validity or priority of such a security interest.
Accordingly, it is possible for the Company to have created prior ranking valid security interests over the same assets
which is not identifiable from a review of the ROMC. Other than entering particulars of any agreements entered into
by a company creating security interests in its ROMC, it is not necessary that any transaction documents creating a
security interest be filed, recorded or enrolled with any governmental, regulatory or judicial authority in the Cayman
Islands in order to ensure the validity of the security interest.

Under the Companies Act, a person who has agreed to become a member of a Cayman Islands company and
whose name is entered on the Register of Members is deemed to be a member of that Cayman Islands company.
Accordingly, a failure to effect such an entry in the Register of Members may restrict the ability of the mortgagee to
enforce its rights over the shares in a Cayman Islands company in respect of the legal title thereto or realise its security
by selling the legal title of such shares to third parties. If the Cayman Islands company or its registered office provider
refuses to enter the mortgagee or its nominee in the Register of Members following enforcement of such security over
shares in a Cayman Islands company, it may be necessary to obtain a court order to compel such action. In addition,
section 99 of the Companies Act provides that when a winding up order has been made, any disposition of a Cayman

364


-----

Islands company’s property and any transfer of shares or alteration in the status of a Cayman Islands company’s
members made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless the Court otherwise orders, void. Further, section
125 of the Companies Act provides that any transfer of shares, not being a transfer of shares with the sanction of the
liquidator, and any alteration in the status of a Cayman Islands company’s members made after the commencement
of a voluntary winding up is void. Depending on the circumstances, such provisions could affect the ability of the
mortgagee to enforce the security created over the shares in the Cayman Islands company.

It does not necessarily follow that, as a matter of Cayman Islands conflict of laws rules, priorities of
competing interests in the shares in a Cayman Islands company will be determined according to Cayman Islands
domestic rules as the jurisdiction of incorporation of a Cayman Islands company. In certain circumstances the issue
of priority may be determined according to the laws of the jurisdiction where the Register of Members of a Cayman
Islands company is situated, the laws of the jurisdiction where the relevant share certificates are situated or the laws
of a contract governing the deposit or custody of the shares in a Cayman Islands company.

**_Security over shares_**

As noted above, the security granted by Topco over the shares of CP Cayman Limited is an equitable share
mortgage, pursuant to which Topco as mortgagor will remain the registered holder of the mortgaged shares in CP
Cayman Limited’s Register of Members until enforcement following an event of default. On the occurrence of an
event of default whilst the mortgagee or its nominee will have the right to be entered as the holder of the mortgaged
shares on the internal Register of Members, it would hold the shares as ‘mortgagee in possession’ subject to the ‘equity
of redemption’ (detailed above). As mortgagee in possession the mortgagee cannot be regarded as the absolute owner
of the shares and would need to sell the shares to satisfy the debt returning the excess proceeds from the sale of the
shares to the mortgagor.

**_Fixed security and recharacterisation risk_**

It is the essence of a fixed charge that the person creating the charge does not have liberty to deal with the
assets which are the subject matter of the security in the sense of disposing of such assets or expending or appropriating
the moneys or claims constituting such assets and accordingly, if and to the extent that such liberty is given to Topco,
any charge constituted pursuant to the Topco Share Security Agreement entered into by Topco may operate as a
floating, rather than a fixed, charge. Depending upon the level of control actually exercised by the chargor, there is
therefore a possibility that the security granted thereunder would be regarded under the Cayman Islands law as a
floating charge. Floating charges have certain weaknesses, including the following:

(vii) they have weak priority against purchasers and chargees (who are not on notice of any
negative pledge contained in the floating charge) of the assets concerned and against lien
holders, execution creditors and creditors with rights of set off;

(viii) the claims of a floating charge holder may be subject to prior claims of preferred creditors
under Cayman Islands law (explained in further detail below); and

(ix) they rank after fixed charges.

**_Preferred creditors_**

Under Cayman Islands law, upon the liquidation of a Cayman Islands company such as Topco, when applying
the proceeds of assets realised in the course of a winding up subject to a debenture or floating charge created by the
company, the claims of a limited category of preferred creditors will take priority over the claims of creditors holding
the relevant security. On a winding up of Topco in the Cayman Islands, the following debts are preferential debts:

(x) any sum due by Topco to an employee, whether employed in the Cayman Islands or
elsewhere, in respect of salaries, wages and gratuities accrued during the four months
immediately preceding the liquidation;

(xi) any sum due and payable by Topco on behalf of an employee in respect of medical health
insurance or pension fund contributions;

(xii) any sum due in respect of severance pay and earned vacation leave where the employee’s
contract has been terminated as a result of the winding up;

(xiii) any compensation payable to a workman in respect of injuries incurred at work pursuant
to the Workmen’s Compensation Act (1996 Revision); and

365


-----

(xiv) certain taxes due to the Cayman Islands Government comprising sums payable under the
Customs and Border Control Act (2024 Revision), the Companies Act, the Stamp Duty Act
(2019 Revision) and the Tourist Accommodation (Taxation) Act (2013 Revision), and any
licence fees payable under regulatory laws.

**_Payment of dividends under Cayman Islands law_**

Under Cayman Islands law, dividends may only be declared by a Cayman Islands company out of funds
legally available for distribution so long as the company has the ability to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary
course of business.

**England and Wales**

Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, and the Issuer and Jersey
Obligor likely have their COMI in England. Therefore, any insolvency proceedings in respect of such Guarantors, the
Issuer and/or the Jersey Obligor would likely be commenced in England and conducted in accordance with the
requirements of English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. To the
extent that a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of England & Wales, the Issuer and/or the Jersey Obligor has any
assets and/or creditors in any overseas jurisdictions and enters into insolvency proceedings in England, recognition of
those proceedings in such other jurisdictions is likely to be a relevant consideration. Such recognition would be a
matter for the private international law of the relevant jurisdictions.

Insolvency proceedings in relation to the Guarantors incorporated under the laws of England and Wales could
also be opened in a country other than England and Wales in circumstances dictated by the domestic local rules of the
jurisdiction in which those insolvency proceedings were to be commenced.

If insolvency proceedings were to be opened in a place other than England and Wales such proceedings could
be in parallel to proceedings opened in England. Such foreign proceedings would not benefit from automatic
recognition in England, although the foreign officeholder could apply under the UNCITRAL Implementing
Regulations, which provide that foreign insolvency proceedings may be recognised in England where a company has
its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity
with human means and assets) in such foreign jurisdiction. It is therefore not possible to say with certainty where
insolvency proceedings will be brought.

**The Insolvency Test**

The Insolvency Act 1986 has no test for or definition of insolvency per se but instead relies on the concept
of a company’s ‘inability to pay its debts’ as the keystone for many of its provisions. Pursuant to section 123 of the
Insolvency Act 1986, the circumstances in which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts include, among others,
the following: (i) if a creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served a
statutory demand on the company requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has failed for three
weeks to pay, secure or compound the sum; (ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable
to pay its debts as they fall due; or (iii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s
assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England may be initiated in a number of ways and by different
parties depending on the process (see below for further detail on each process).

**Liquidation/Winding-Up**

Liquidation is a terminal insolvency process pursuant to which the assets of a company are realised by the
liquidator and the proceeds distributed to creditors in accordance with a statutory order of priority (see ‘Statutory order
of priorities’ below), with any surplus paid to the shareholders. Once the liquidator has completed this task, the
company will be dissolved and removed from the register of companies.

There are two different types of liquidation: (i) compulsory; and (ii) voluntary, which is in turn divided into
members’ voluntary liquidation (MVL) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (CVL).

Regardless of how a liquidator is appointed, a liquidator owes his or her duties to the company and its
creditors as a whole and has wide powers to do whatever necessary for the conduct of the liquidation. This includes
the power to: (i) agree, compromise and pay creditor claims; (ii) sell any of the company’s property; (iii) bring or
defend any legal proceedings on behalf of the company; (iv) disclaim onerous property or contracts in accordance

366


-----

with section 178 of the Insolvency Act 1986; (v) bring actions against the directors or former directors; and (vi) bring
actions to set aside certain transactions.

In a compulsory liquidation, there is an automatic stay on proceedings being commenced or continued against
the company or its property except with the permission of the court. In a voluntary liquidation, there is no such
automatic stay although the court may, upon the application of the liquidator or any creditor, or contributory of the
company, order a stay under its general discretionary power in section 112 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

_Compulsory liquidation_

Compulsory liquidation is a court-based procedure pursuant to which a creditor or one of the other parties
set out in section 124 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (including the company itself or the directors of the company
collectively) petitions for the winding up of a company and the court makes a winding up order. The grounds which
entitle the court to make a winding up order are set out in section 122 of the Insolvency Act 1986. The most common
grounds are that: (i) the company is unable to pay its debts (see “The Insolvency Test” above for the meaning of this
term); and (ii) it is just and equitable for the company to be wound up. Further, there is an automatic stay on
proceedings being commenced or continued against the company or its property except with the permission of the
court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security.

Under section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986, any disposition of the company’s property, any transfer of the
company’s shares and any altering of the status of company members is void if made following the ‘commencement
of a winding up’ unless the court orders otherwise. Subject to certain exceptions, if a winding up order is made, it is
deemed to have commenced on the date on which the winding up petition was presented. This gives section 127
retrospective effect, meaning that any of the specified transactions carried out after the presentation of a winding up
petition will be void if a winding up order is subsequently made unless the company (or an interested party) has first
obtained a validation order from the court.

A liquidation does not in itself terminate financial or commercial contracts, but a liquidator does have the
power to disclaim onerous contracts and he or she can choose to breach a contract if he or she considers it to be in the
best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an unsecured debt – see
“Statutory order of priorities” below).

_Members’ voluntary liquidation_

A MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders
pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court.

Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the majority of the directors must
swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after making full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they have
formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts in full, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the
start of the liquidation.

_Creditors’ voluntary liquidation_

A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders passing a special resolution to place the company into
liquidation and has no court involvement. In contrast to a MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory
declaration of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent) and, after the shareholders’
meeting, the creditors must also resolve to place the company into liquidation. If the creditors choose a different person
to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail unless any director, member or creditor of
the company successfully applies to the court for an order otherwise.

In a voluntary liquidation, there is no automatic stay on proceedings being commenced or continued against
the company or its property although the court may, upon the application of the liquidator or any creditor, or
contributory of the company, order a stay under its general discretionary power in section 112 of the IA86.

**_Administration_**

The relevant English insolvency statute empowers English courts, upon receiving an application, to make an
administration order in respect of an English company in certain circumstances (the ‘in-court route’). An administrator
can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (the ‘outof-court route’). The in-court route is commenced by an application to court by the company itself, a majority of its

367


-----

directors, one or more of its creditors including contingent or prospective creditors, and, where applicable, the
Financial Conduct Authority or the Prudential Regulation Authority or certain other designated persons. The out-ofcourt method of appointment is available only to the directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying
floating charge (QFC) (see further below for the meaning of this term). No physical court hearing is required and the
administrator’s appointment takes effect when the court stamps receipt of the relevant forms.

A QFC is defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 as being a floating charge
created by an instrument which: (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it; and/or (ii) purports to empower
the holder of the floating charge to appoint an administrative receiver and/or an administrator of the company. A
person is the holder of a QFC if that person holds one or more debentures of the company secured by charges and
other forms of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at
least one of which is a qualifying floating charge.

When any person other than a holder of a QFC makes an administration appointment (whether by the incourt or out-of-court route), it will be necessary to show that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its
debts (see ‘The Insolvency test’ above). Regardless of how an administrator is appointed, the administrator will need
to consent to act as administrator and to state that, in his or her opinion, one of the following statutory objectives can
be satisfied (the second objective can only be considered if the first objective is not reasonably practicable and
similarly for the third objective): (i) to rescue the company as a going concern; (ii) to achieve a better result for
creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up without first being in administration; or (iii)
to realise property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (see ‘Statutory order of
priorities’ below).

An interim moratorium takes effect when an application to appoint an administrator is made or a notice of
intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court. This becomes final once the company is in administration. The
moratorium means, among other things, that no other legal process or proceedings may be commenced or continued
against the company and no step can be taken to enforce security over the company’s property (in each case except
with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court), no administrative receiver can be appointed, no
resolution can be passed for the winding-up of the company and, except in certain limited circumstances, no order be
made for the winding-up of the company (in each case except with the consent of the administrator or the permission
of the court).

Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realise their security over that company’s
property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the administration
moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” (generally, cash or financial instruments such as
shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral
Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (Financial Collateral Regulations). During the administration of a company,
a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than security financial collateral arrangements)
without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court.

An administrator owes his or her duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. Upon appointment, an
administrator takes control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control of all property to
which the administrator thinks the company is entitled. He or she has broad powers to deal with the company and its
assets, except in respect of assets which are subject to fixed charge security (where powers are more restrictive). The
permission of the court is required to dispose of any such fixed charge assets, such permission will only be granted if
disposing of the property in question is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and the proceeds of sale are
paid to the fixed charge holder. An administrator’s powers further extend to investigating why the company failed
and, where appropriate, bringing actions against the directors or former directors or seeking to set aside certain
transactions.

An administration does not itself terminate any contracts and, unlike a liquidator, an administrator does not
have the power to disclaim or terminate contracts (although he or she can choose to breach a contract if he or she
considers it to be in the best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an
unsecured debt – see ‘Statutory order of priorities’ below).

Following the enactment of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, contractual terms providing
for automatic termination or a right of termination by the counterparty of contracts of supplies of goods and services
upon the occurrence of an insolvency event (including administration) will generally be suspended for the duration of
the relevant insolvency procedure (see “Supplier Contracts” below).

**_Administrative Receivership_**

Section 72A(1) of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides that the holder of a QFC in respect of a company’s
property may not appoint an administrative receiver of the company subject to certain exemptions set out in sections
72B to 72GA.

Pursuant to section 72B of the Insolvency Act 1986, the first exception to this general prohibition is in the
context of capital markets. There are three limbs that have to be satisfied in order to qualify for this exception: (i) the
appointment is in pursuance of an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement; (ii) a party incurs,
or when the agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £50 million under the arrangement;
and (iii) the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment.

Each of the above three limbs is considered further below.

Pursuant to paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A to the Insolvency Act 1986, an arrangement is a capital market
arrangement if: (i) it involves a grant of security to (A) a person holding it as trustee for a person who holds a capital
market investment issued by a party to the arrangement; or (B) a party to the arrangement who issues a capital market
investment; or (C) a person who holds the security as trustee for a party to the arrangement in connection with the
issue of a capital market investment; or (D) a person who holds the security as trustee for a party to the arrangement
who agrees to provide finance to another party; or (ii) at least one party guarantees the performance of obligations of
another party; or (iii) at least one party provides security in respect of the performance of the obligations of another
party; or (iv) it involves an investment of a kind described in articles 83 to 85 of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (SI 2001/544), which relates to options, futures and contract for
differences (the Regulated Activities Order).

Paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 2A to the Insolvency Act 1986 states that a party to an arrangement includes a
party to an agreement which forms part of the arrangement, provides for the raising of finance as part of the
arrangement, or is necessary for the purposes of implementing the arrangement. Center Parcs notes that there is no
statutory definition or case law on the meaning of the term “arrangement”, however it is clear that an arrangement can
be more than just one agreement and in Center Parcs’ view the term is apposite to describe a series of inter-related
transactions.

Pursuant to paragraph 5 of Schedule 2A to the Insolvency Act 1986, the requirement to incur debt of at least
£50 million may be incurred at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement and may be expressed wholly
or partly in foreign currency (in which case the sterling equivalent shall be calculated as at the time when the
arrangement is entered into).

Pursuant to paragraph 2 of Schedule 2A to the Insolvency Act 1986, an investment is a capital market
investment if it: (i) is within article 77 or 77A of the Regulated Activities Order; and (ii) is rated, listed or traded or
designed to be rated, listed or traded.

To place a company into administrative receivership, the holder of a QFC must execute a document
appointing an administrative receiver in accordance with the terms of the security document pursuant to which the
QFC was created. This appointment document must then be delivered to the proposed administrative receiver and the
appointment takes effect upon receipt (provided that the administrative receiver formally accepts the appointment by
the end of the next business day). There is no statutory moratorium that takes effect in relation to or as a result of the
appointment of an administrative receiver.

The principal duty of an administrative receiver is to realise the assets of the company in order to repay the
principal and interest secured by the document pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed. An
administrative receiver generally has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets which derive from both
the security document pursuant to which he or she was appointed and Schedule 1 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (except
insofar as this is inconsistent with the terms of that security document). In exercising such powers, an administrative
receiver acts as agent of the company, unless and until it goes into liquidation. However, an administrative receiver
can only dispose of assets which are subject to prior ranking security with the permission of the court if the court is
satisfied that the disposal (with or without other property) would be likely to promote a more advantageous realisation
of the company’s property than would otherwise be effected and on the condition that the proceeds of sale and any
difference between those and the open market value are paid to the holder of that security. Further, unlike an
administrator, an administrative receiver’s powers do not extend to bringing actions against the directors or former
directors or (except in very limited circumstances) seeking to set aside certain transactions.

369


-----

Assets coming into the hands of the administrative receiver are applied in payment of Secured Debt, less any
costs of realisation, the preferential debts and the prescribed part (as to the meaning of which see ‘Statutory order of
priorities’ below).

**_Restructuring procedures_**

As well as formal insolvency proceedings, there are various restructuring tools under the laws of England
which an English Guarantor may be subject to. Some of these processes are under the Companies Act 2006 (e.g. a
scheme of arrangement and a restructuring plan) and some under the Insolvency Act 1986 (e.g. a company voluntary
arrangement). Further details on these processes are set out below.

**_Schemes of arrangement_**

Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction the
compromise of a company’s liabilities where such company is liable to be wound-up under the Insolvency Act 1986;
and in the context of a foreign company, all that is required is a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction. In
practice, the sufficient connection test has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s
COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance
documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case
will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether
or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and
reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on a detailed debt compromise in respect
of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected
by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be
proposed by the company or its creditors. If 75% or more by value and over 50% in number of those creditors present
and voting at the creditor meeting(s) vote in favour of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval
thresholds contained in the finance documents, that compromise will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding
on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of
arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of arrangement. In certain circumstances, a scheme of
arrangement can also result in the release of guarantees in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise. The
court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications
being made or reject the scheme.

**_Restructuring Plan_**

Pursuant to Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a
compromise or arrangement (a “Restructuring Plan”) proposed between a company and its creditors (or any class of
them) or its members (or any class of them) in circumstances where the company has encountered, or is likely to
encounter, financial difficulties that affect, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern.
The purpose of the Restructuring Plan is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of these financial
difficulties. Similar to a scheme of arrangement, the Restructuring Plan procedure is open to any company liable to be
wound up under the Insolvency Act 1986 (i.e. a foreign company may use the procedure provided that certain
conditions are met).

For a consensual plan (i.e. one where each class votes in favour) to be capable of being sanctioned by the
court, the Restructuring Plan must be approved by 75% by value of creditors or shareholders in each class (there is no
majority by number test as is the case with a scheme of arrangement). The applicant may also apply to the court to
exclude a class from voting if they have no genuine economic interest in the company. Unlike a scheme, if not all
classes have approved the Restructuring Plan as required for a consensual plan, dissenting classes may be crammed
down provided that: (i) no members of the dissenting class would be worse off under the Restructuring Plan than they
would be in the most likely alternative scenario (in the court’s view) if the Restructuring Plan is not sanctioned (the
‘relevant alternative’); and (ii) the Restructuring Plan is agreed by 75% by value of a class of creditors or (as the case
may be) shareholders who would receive a payment, or has a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event
of the relevant alternative. Even if the voting threshold is met, the court may nevertheless refuse to sanction the
Restructuring Plan if it is not ‘just and equitable’. If the Restructuring Plan is sanctioned, it will be binding on all
affected parties, including those who did not participate in the vote on the Restructuring Plan and those who voted
against the Restructuring Plan.

**_Company voluntary arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act 1986, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator
as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which
entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors. Provided that the proposal is
approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors
who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured
creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75%
(by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of
unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement.
However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who proves in the
company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security.

**_Supplier contracts_**

One of the common challenges involved in using a formal process to rescue and restructure a company is
that it can trigger termination or other consequences under supply contracts. This makes the company vulnerable to
ransom creditors. New provisions have been introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 in
order to supplement the existing essential supplier regime (see below) to help the continuation of supply of goods and
services to companies in an insolvency process.

_Essential suppliers_

The essential supplier regime under sections 233 and 233A of the Insolvency Act 1986 (i) prevents the
suppliers from, where a company is subject to a qualifying form of insolvency procedure (including administration,
liquidation and a CVA) and a request is made by or with the concurrence of the insolvency officerholder for the giving,
after the date that insolvency procedure commenced or the CVA took effect (as applicable), of any essential supplies,
making it a condition of the giving of the supply, or doing anything which has the effect of making it a condition of
the giving of the supply, that any outstanding charges in respect of a supply given to the company before the effective
date are paid; and (ii) where a company enters administration or a CVA takes effect, subject to certain exceptions,
compels continued supply by restricting the effect of existing insolvency-related terms in contracts for the supply of
essential goods or services.

Essential supplies include such things as water, gas, electricity, communications services, wi-fi and chipand-pin devices.

_Other suppliers_

Section 233B of the Insolvency Act 1986 says that (subject to certain exceptions), if a company is subject to
a qualifying form of insolvency process (including the moratorium, restructuring plan, CVA, administration and
liquidation or where a court order is made summoning a meeting relating to a Restructuring Plan), (i) any provision
of a supply contract which provides any provision of a supply contract which provides that the contract or supply
would terminate, or any other thing would take place, or that the supplier would be entitled to terminate the contract
or the supply or do any other thing (for example, change payment or supply terms) because the company becomes
subject to the relevant insolvency procedure, will cease to have effect; (ii) suppliers will be unable to exercise any
entitlement arising before the start of the insolvency period to terminate the contract or the supply because of an event
occurring before the start of the insolvency period, for the duration of the insolvency period (which in some cases
could be measured in years) and (iii) suppliers will be unable to impose ransoms by demanding payment of outstanding
amounts in respect of pre-commencement supply as a condition of continuing supply.

The prohibitions apply to both new and pre-existing contracts and last for the duration of the process, which
in some cases could be measured in years. The prohibitions will continue to apply if the company enters into a second
insolvency process.Certain contracts involving financial services are excluded from the regime, including a capital
market arrangement. In addition, suppliers under the current essential supply regime (see above) and certain types of
entities (such as banks or insurance companies), whether such entities are the customer or the supplier, are excluded
from this regime. Additionally, the regime does not apply to insolvency-related terms of a contract for the supply of
essential goods or services which cease to have effect under section 233A of the IA86 (as described above).

371


-----

Suppliers may still terminate contracts or exercise other contractual rights (which would otherwise be
restricted by the provisions) if: (i) they receive consent from the company or officeholder; or (ii) the court is satisfied
that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. Supplier rights relating to events arising after
the insolvency process begins are not affected.

**_Statutory order of priorities_**

A liquidator or administrator will need to comply with the following statutory order of priority when he or she
distributes the proceeds of realised assets to a company’s creditors: (i) proceeds of realisations from assets subject to
a fixed charge are paid to the fixed charge holder (less any costs of realisation); (ii) any prescribed fees or expenses
of the official receiver, moratorium debts and certain “priority pre-moratorium debts” in circumstances where a
company has entered into a restructuring moratorium and subsequently entered into administration or liquidation
within 12 weeks beginning with the day after the end of the moratorium (iii) expenses of the liquidation or the
administration, which includes monies arising under a contract entered into by the administrator or liquidator, or any
necessary disbursements made in the ordinary insolvency process; (iv) ordinary preferential debts, which include (but
are not limited to) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes, wages and salaries of employees for work
done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person, holiday pay due to any
employee whose contract has been terminated and bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under
the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) up to the statutory limit; (v) secondary preferential debts, being
bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that the claims exceed the
statutory limit, deposits made through a non-EEA branch of a credit institution that would otherwise have been eligible
for FSCS compensation, and claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including
student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding
corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers;
(vi) subject to certain exceptions, the prescribed part, which is a ring fenced amount of money that the administrator
or liquidator must set aside from realisations from floating charge assets to distribute to unsecured creditors –
calculated as 50% of the first £10,000 of net realisations and 20% of the net realisations thereafter, up to a maximum
of £800,000 where the first ranking floating charge was created on or after 6 April 2020 (£600,000 if created before
then); (vii) proceeds of floating charge asset realisations (less any costs of realisation, the preferential debts and the
prescribed part), according to the priority of the security; (viii) provable debts of unsecured creditors (these rank
equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them) and any secured
creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up
to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings; (ix) statutory interest that arises on debts after
the insolvency at either the higher of the contractual and the official rate determined in accordance with the Judgments
Act 1838; and (x) non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and
which are therefore only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid.

Any surplus will be paid to the shareholders in accordance with the company’s articles of association. There
are no equitable subordination provisions under English law, meaning that an unsecured shareholder loan ranks as a
provable debt alongside other unsecured creditors and will not be subordinated by law.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that
is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are
only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency
set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their
mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation
of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if
amounts remain due to the company).

**_Fixed and floating charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security:
(a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash, or
use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to

372


-----

operate the charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder;
(b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge
over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallised at the time the fixed charge was
granted); (c) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s or administrator’s remuneration and the costs of
continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in a winding
up or administration are payable out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating
charge) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to
deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets
can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the
floating charge and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating
charge security; (e) in comparison to fixed charge security, floating charge security is subject to certain additional
challenges under English insolvency law; and (f) where the floating charge is not created or otherwise arising under a
“financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or
tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Regulations floating charge
security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions and
salaries owed to employees) and to ring-fencing of the “prescribed part” for unsecured creditors. This summary does
not set out an exhaustive statement of consequences of the distinction between fixed and floating security interests.
This summary does not set out an exhaustive statement of consequences of the distinction between fixed and floating
security interests.

Please note, however, that with prior approval of the court, an administrator may also deal with property
subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration
and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging
the obligations of the company to the charge holder.

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterise fixed security interests purported to
be created by a security document as floating charges; the description given to security interests by the parties is not
determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating
security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the
relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is
exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets or their proceeds in the
course of its business without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallisation, the court is likely to hold that the
security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge
in the security documents.

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be required
to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security (after making full
provision for preferential creditors and expenses (floating charge realisations)) for the benefit of unsecured creditors.
Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realisations and 20% of the remainder
over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 where the first ranking floating charge was created on or
after 6 April 2020 (£600,000 if created before then).

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into
administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) following the granting of the
guarantee or security.

The following potential grounds for challenge set out in the Insolvency Act 1986 may apply to guarantees
and security interests.

**_Transaction at an Undervalue (section 238)_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court
for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee, if such liquidator or administrator believes
that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. Section 118 of the
Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (the “SBEEA”) introduced section 246ZD to the Insolvency
Act 1986 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of action in
respect of any transaction under section 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Where a foreign officeholder has been granted

373


-----

recognition under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations, he or she also has standing to bring a claim for a
transaction at an undervalue.

There will only be a transaction at an undervalue, if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the
transaction, the English company was or became unable to pay its debts as a result of such transaction within the
meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (although there is a rebuttable presumption that the company was
unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction if the transaction is made to a person connected to the company
such as a shareholder or a director (a connected person)). The transaction can be challenged if the English company
enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the English company
grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an
undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the receives no consideration of if the company receives
consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company.

However, a court generally will not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction
in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds
for believing that the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an
undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the
transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that
the company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency
Act 1986, as amended), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate
the solvency of the company in such proceedings.

**_Preference (section 239)_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the
creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. Section 118 of the SBEEA introduced
section 246ZD to the Insolvency Act 1986 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may
assign the cause of action in respect of any preference under section 239 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Where a foreign
officeholder has been granted recognition under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations he or she also has
standing to bring a preference claim.

There will only be a preference if, at the time the transaction was entered into, the company was or became
as a consequence of its entry into the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the
Insolvency Act 1986. The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into liquidation or administration
proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person)
or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the company takes the decision to grant the
security interest or the guarantee ending with the onset of insolvency. A transaction will constitute a preference if it
has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other
liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor,
guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines
that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it
would have been if that preference had not been given, which could, in this case, include reducing payments under
the Offered Notes (although there is protection for a third-party who enters into one of the transactions in good faith
and without notice). However, for the court to do so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the
company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator
or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced
by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in
which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and
the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence.

The desire to prefer requires a “positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the company’s
insolvent liquidation” (Re Fairway Magazines Ltd [1993] BCLC 643). A preferential effect for a creditor may be
foreseen by the company without being desired. Where a company is influenced by “proper commercial
considerations” there will be no desire to prefer and therefore no voidable preference (Re MC Bacon [1990] BCLC
324).

**_Transaction Defrauding Creditors (section 423)_**

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made
for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a
company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or
may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. The fact that the
transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defence to the claim. It will suffice that the company’s
subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to
show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice.

An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by an administrator, a
liquidator, the supervisor of a voluntary arrangement in certain circumstances and, subject to certain conditions, the
Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any
person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the permission of the court in the
case of a company in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. A foreign
officeholder recognised under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations also has standing to apply to court.

There is no time limit in the English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made and the
relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction (subject to the normal statutory limitation
periods). If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such
orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and
to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose
any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However,
such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor in
good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a
benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum
unless such person was a party to the transaction.

**_Avoidance of Floating Charge (section 245)_**

Under English insolvency law, if a company is unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of
the Insolvency Act 1986 at the time of (or as a result of) granting a floating charge, and the floating charge was granted
within the specified period referred to below, then such floating charge is automatically invalid except to the extent
of the aggregate of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of
any debt of (and the amount of such interest payable in respect of the money paid, services supplied in
reduction/discharge in debt), the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge. This
means that a floating charge can be partly invalid to the extent that it is provided for past consideration. No court
action is required save for where there is a foreign officeholder recognised under the UNCITRAL Implementing
Regulations who wishes to attack the floating charge under article 23 of the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations.

The requirement for the company to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge
does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the floating charge is granted to a
connected person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below, then the floating
charge is invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied
to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of (and the amount of such interest payable in respect of the money paid,
services supplied in reduction/discharge in debt), the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the
floating charge, whether the relevant company is solvent or insolvent.

The granting of the floating charge can be challenged only if the relevant company enters into liquidation or
administration proceedings within a period of 12 months (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if
the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the relevant company grants the floating charge. However, if the
floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements
(No. 2) Regulations 2003, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph.

**_Extortionate credit transactions (section 244)_**

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit transaction,
the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, an assignee of such officeholder or a foreign
officeholder recognised under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations set the transaction aside. Section 118 of the
SBEEA introduced section 246ZD to the Insolvency Act 1986 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and

375


-----

administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any
extortionate credit transaction claim under section 244 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either:
(i) its terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in
respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing.

The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up to
three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation (which is slightly
different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and preferences).

**_Orders_**

In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e. not section 245), the court
has very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before
the transaction was entered into.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer, the Obligors and the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners entered into a
subscription agreement with respect to the Offered Notes dated        2024 (the “Subscription Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein, the Class B
Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners have agreed, severally and not jointly, to subscribe and pay for the
aggregate principal amounts of the Offered Notes as set out opposite its name below.

**Principal amount of the Offered Notes**
Barclays Bank PLC...........................................................................
HSBC Bank PLC ..............................................................................
NatWest Markets PLC......................................................................
**Total .................................................................................................** **£330,000,000**

The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners are entitled to fees and reimbursement of certain
expenses pursuant to the Subscription Agreement.

The Offered Notes will initially be offered at the price set forth herein.

The Subscription Agreement provides that the several obligations of the Class B Global Coordinators and
Joint Bookrunners to pay for and accept delivery of the Offered Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the
delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel. The Subscription Agreement also provides that the Issuer and the
Obligors upon accession to the Subscription Agreement will indemnify the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint
Bookrunners against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments
that the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners may be required to make in respect thereof.

Persons who purchase the Offered Notes from the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners may
be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of
purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

Delivery of the Offered Notes is expected to be made against payment on the respective Offered Notes on
2024, which is the    business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act) following
the date of pricing of the Offered Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+   ” (U.S.)). Under Rule
15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days (until
the end of the period of transition to a settlement cycle of T+1 on May 28, 2024) unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise.

The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners may engage in over-allotment, stabilising
transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Joint Bookrunner.
Stabilising transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilising bids do not exceed
a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Offered Notes in the open market after the
distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim
a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Offered Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are
purchased in a stabilising or covering transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the offering of the Offered Notes, the Stabilising Manager, or a person acting on its behalf,
may engage in transactions that stabilise, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Offered Notes. Specifically, the
Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilise
the price of the Offered Notes. The Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over-allot the
offering of the Offered Notes, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Offered Notes in the
open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on its behalf,
may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and
impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilise or maintain the respective market price of the Offered Notes above
market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilising Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and
may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets
for, the Offered Notes.

**Selling Restrictions**

**_United States_**

The Offered Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered
or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except in certain transactions
exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

Each Class B Global Coordinator and Joint Bookrunner has agreed, severally and not jointly, that, except as
permitted by the Subscription Agreement, it will not offer or sell the Offered Notes (a) as part of their distribution at
any time or (b) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Offered Notes and
the Ninth Closing Date (the “Distribution Compliance Period”) within the United States to, or for the account or
benefit of, U.S. persons, and it will have sent to each dealer to which it sells Offered Notes during the Distribution
Compliance Period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Offered Notes
within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the
meanings given to them by Regulation S.

The Offered Notes are being offered and sold outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering of the Offered Notes, an offer or sale of
Offered Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering of the Offered Notes)
may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

The Issuer, the Obligors and the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners reserve the right to
reject any offer to purchase the Offered Notes, in whole or in part, for any reason. This Offering Memorandum does
not constitute an offer to any person in the United States or to any U.S. person. Distribution of this Offering
Memorandum to any person, other than to a non-U.S. person outside the United States and those persons, if any,
retained to advise such non-U.S. person outside the United States with respect thereto, is unauthorised, and any
disclosure without the prior written consent of the Issuer, as applicable, of any of its contents to any person, except to
a non-U.S. person outside the United States and to those persons, if any, retained to advise such non-U.S. person
outside the United States, is prohibited.

**_United Kingdom_**

Each Class B Global Coordinator and Joint Bookrunner has represented and agreed that it (i) has only
communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation
or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in
connection with the issue or sale of any Offered Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not
apply to the Issuer and (ii) has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Offered Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners have represented and agreed that they have not
offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Offered Notes to
any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means a person who
is one (or more) of the following:

(a) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID
**II”); or**

(b) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance
**Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined**
in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.

**_Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors_**

The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners have represented and agreed that they have not
offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Offered Notes to

378


-----

any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means
a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(a) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part
of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

(b) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made
under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

**_General_**

Each Class B Global Coordinator and Joint Bookrunner has undertaken that it will not, directly or indirectly,
offer or sell any Offered Notes or have in its possession, distribute or publish any offering memorandum, prospectus,
form of application, advertisement or other document or information in any country or jurisdiction except under
circumstances that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, result in compliance with any applicable laws and
regulations and all offers and sales of the Offered Notes by it will be made on the same terms.

**_Other relationships_**

The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates may have performed
and continue to perform various financial advisory, investment banking and commercial banking services for, and
may arrange loans and other non-public market financing for, and enter into derivative transactions with, Center Parcs
and/or their affiliates (including its shareholders, the Issuer and the other Obligors) and for which they may receive
customary fees and expenses. The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates
may provide such services in the future. Entities affiliated with Barclays Bank PLC or any of its respective affiliates
are agents and other lenders under the Liquidity Facility Agreement. Additionally, in the ordinary course of their
business, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates may make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments
and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates (including the Notes).
The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners or their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship
with the Issuer routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Typically, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates would hedge
such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation
of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future
trading prices of the Notes. The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates
may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such
securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions
in such securities and instruments.

JUDGMENT IN EVALUATING THE INVESTMENT IN THIS NOTE.

5. At the time of its acquisition and throughout the period in which it holds such Offered Notes or any
interest therein: (1) either (a) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor or a
governmental, church or non-U.S. plan that is subject to any Similar Law or (b) its acquisition,
holding and disposition of such Offered Notes (or any interest therein) will not constitute or result
in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or
a violation of any Similar Law, and (2) it will not sell or otherwise transfer such Offered Notes (or
any interest therein) to any transferee that is a Benefit Plan Investor or any person acting on behalf
of a Benefit Plan Investor. Any purported purchase, transfer, holding or disposition in violation of
these representations will be void. If such purchase, transfer, holding or disposition is not treated as
being void for any reason, the Offered Notes will automatically be transferred to a charitable trust
for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and the purported holder will acquire no right in the
Offered Notes.

If it is, or is acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor, (1) none of the Transaction Parties has
provided any investment recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any Plan Fiduciary

own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Offered Notes.

It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Obligors, the Class B Registrar, the Class B Transfer Agent, the
Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their affiliates and others will rely upon the
truth and accuracy of the above acknowledgements, representations and agreements and agrees that,
if any of the acknowledgements, representations or agreements deemed to have been made by it by
its purchase of Offered Notes is no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Issuer, the Obligors
and the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners. If it is acquiring any Offered Notes as
a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment

discretion with respect to each of those accounts and that it has full power to make the above
acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each account.

The purchaser and any fiduciary causing it to acquire an interest in any Offered Notes agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, the Obligors, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint
Bookrunners, the Class B Note Trustee and their respective affiliates, from and against any cost,
damage or loss incurred by any of them as a result of any of the foregoing representations and
agreements being or becoming false.

**LISTING AND GENERAL INFORMATION**

**Listing**

Application will be made to the Authority to list the Offered Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. The
Issuer does not intend to provide to the public post-issuance transaction information regarding the securities to be
admitted to trading or the performance of the underlying assets. For so long as the Offered Notes are listed on the
Exchange and the rules of the Authority require, physical copies of the following documents may be inspected and
obtained at the office of the Issuer at 44 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey JE4 9WG, during normal business hours on any
weekday:

      - the organisational documents of the Issuer;

      - the Issuer’s audited financial statements as at and for each of the 52-week period ended 20 April
2023 and 21 April 2022, and any interim financial statements published by the Issuer;

      - Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as at and
for each of the 36-week periods ended 29 December 2022 and 28 December 2023;

      - Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited’s audited consolidated financial statements as at and for each of
the 52-week periods ended 20 April 2023 and 21 April 2022 and 22 April 2021; and

      - the Note Trust Deed relating to the Offered Notes.

The Issuer has appointed Carey Olsen Corporate Finance Limited as listing agent with its address at 47
Esplanade, St. Helier JE1 0BD, Jersey and HSBC Bank plc as Principal Paying Agent, registrar and transfer agent
with its address at 8 Canada Square, London, E14 5HQ, United Kingdom. The Class B Note Trustee is HSBC
Corporate Trustee Company (UK) Limited with its address at 8 Canada Square, London, E14 5HQ. The Class B Note
Trustee is acting in its capacity of trustee for the holders of the Offered Notes and will provide such services to the
holders of the Offered Notes as described in the Note Trust Deed. Center Parcs reserves the right to change these
appointments.

Application may be made to the Authority to have the Offered Notes removed from listing on the Official
List of the Exchange, including if necessary to avoid any new withholding taxes in connection with the listing. No
assurance can be given that this application will be granted, and Center Parcs cannot assure you that an active trading
market for the Offered Notes will develop.

So long as the Offered Notes are admitted to trading on the Exchange, the Offered Notes will be freely
transferable and negotiable in accordance with the rules of the Authority.
