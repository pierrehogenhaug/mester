**Coordinators”), being the sender or senders of the attached, that you are (1)(a) not a U.S. person (within the meaning of**
Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”) and (b) are located and accessing the e-mail to which this offering
memorandum is attached outside the United States of America, its territories or possessions (including Puerto Rico, the U.S.
Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island and the Northern Mariana Islands), any State of the United States or the
District of Columbia, and are (2)(a) a relevant person (as defined below) located in the United Kingdom or (b) a person that is
outside the United Kingdom and (3) not a “retail investor” if you are a resident in the United Kingdom or a member state of
the European Economic Area (the EEA).

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS - The Offered Notes are not intended to be offered,**
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the
European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a “retail
client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as
a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required
by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the "PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the Offered Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Offered

of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Offered Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Offered Notes or

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM**
**CONFIDENTIAL**

###### CPUK Finance Limited


**NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION**

**IN THE UNITED STATES**


(incorporated in Jersey with limited liability under registration number 108635)

£255,000,000   % Class B6 Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2051


CPUK Finance Limited (the “Issuer”), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Jersey, is offering £255,000,000 aggregate principal amount of   % Class B6
Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2051 (the “Class B6 Notes” or the “Offered Notes”).

Interest on the Class B6 Notes will accrue at a rate of   % per annum (the “Class B6 Note Interest Rate”) from (and including) the issue date to (but excluding) 28 August 2027
(“Class B6 Note Step-Down Date”) and thereafter will accrue at a rate of   % per annum. Interest on the Class B6 Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on 28 February and 28 August
(subject to adjustment as specified herein for non-Business Days) (each, a “Note Interest Payment Date”) in each year commencing on 28 August 2021. The Issuer’s obligations to pay principal
and interest on the Class B6 Notes are intended to be met from the payments by the Borrowers of principal and interest in the corresponding periods on £255,000,000 Class B6 Loan (as defined
herein) granted by the Issuer to the Borrowers on the issue date of the Offered Notes pursuant to the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (each as defined herein). If on any Note
Interest Payment Date, the amount received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B6 Loan is not sufficient to pay the interest accrued on the Class B6 Notes during the
immediately preceding Note Interest Period in full, the amount of interest accrued up to any such Note Interest Payment Date that is not paid by the Issuer on such Note Interest Payment Date will
be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest, being a “Deferred Interest Amount”) and such Deferred Interest Amount shall continue to accrue interest at the then applicable Class B6 Note
Interest Rate until it is paid by the Issuer in full. Interest paid on the Class B6 Loans will be payable in cash on each Loan Interest Payment Date (as defined herein) to (but not including) 25 August
2027 (the “Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date”) and thereafter accruing interest shall be deferred.

The Class B6 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full on 28 August 2027 (the “Class B6 Note Expected Maturity Date”). The Class B6 Notes will be subject to mandatory
redemption and/or may be subject to optional redemption before such dates in certain circumstances, including if and to the extent the Borrowers make principal repayments or prepayments to the
Issuer in respect of the Class B6 Loan. See “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes — Condition 5 (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation)”.

The Borrowers may prepay the Class B6 Loan in whole or in part at any time on or after 28 August 2023 at the prepayment prices specified herein. Prior to 28 August 2023, the
Borrowers may prepay the Class B6 Loan in whole or in part at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts, if any,
up to the prepayment date plus the applicable “make-whole” premium, as described herein. Prior to 28 August 2023, the Borrowers may prepay up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount
of the Class B6 Loan in each calendar year at a prepayment price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Class B6 Loan prepaid. In addition, prior to 28 August 2023, the Borrowers may use
the net proceeds of specified equity offerings to prepay up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Class B6 Loan at a prepayment price equal to   % of the principal amount of the Class
B6 Loan prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts, if any, up to the prepayment date, provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Class B6
Loan remains outstanding following the prepayment. Additionally, the Borrowers may prepay all, but not less than all, of the Class B6 Loan at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, up to the prepayment date
upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon certain events constituting a change of control, the Borrowers may be required to make an offer to repurchase all the Class B6
Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and
additional amounts, if any, up to the purchase date. In the event of any prepayment by the Borrowers of the Class B6 Loan, in whole or in part, the Issuer will be required to apply the proceeds
received from such prepayment to redeem a corresponding principal amount of Class B6 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid
interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, at a redemption price corresponding to the applicable prepayment price set forth in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. In addition,
in connection with certain tender offers for the Class B6 Notes, if holders of not less than 90 per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B6 Notes validly tender and do
not withdraw such Class B6 Notes in such tender offer and a Borrower purchases all of the Class B6 Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Borrowers may prepay the
remaining principal amount of the Class B6 Loan, in whole, but not in part, at a price equal to the purchase price offered to holders of the Class B6 Notes pursuant to such tender offer and the
Issuer will be required to apply the proceeds received from such prepayment to redeem a corresponding principal amount of Class B6 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest
amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, at a redemption price corresponding to the prepayment price.

The Offered Notes will rank pari passu with the Class B4 Notes and the Class B5 Notes. The Offered Notes will be contractually subordinated to, among others, the Class A Notes
(as defined herein) and will not be guaranteed by any person, except that the Offered Notes will benefit indirectly from the Topco Payment Undertaking (as defined below). The Class B Loans (as
defined herein) are contractually subordinated to, among others, the Class A Loans (as defined herein), the Liquidity Facility (as defined herein) and certain hedging arrangements, as described
further herein. The Class B Loans are guaranteed by the Borrowers and certain subsidiaries of CP Cayman Midco 2 Limited (“Topco”), as further described herein. Pursuant to an amended and
restated deed of undertaking entered into on the Fourth Closing Date (the “Topco Payment Undertaking”), Topco has undertaken to procure payment of all principal, interest and other amounts
outstanding under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in the circumstances described herein, including in the event that the Class B6 Loan is not repaid in full on the Class B6 Loan
Expected Maturity Date. The Offered Notes will be secured by substantially all the Issuer’s property and assets (including its rights against each Obligor under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement), which security will also be shared with, among others, the Class A Notes. The Offered Notes will rank junior to the Class A Notes with respect to the application of enforcement
proceeds, other than in respect of the Topco Security. The Class B Loans rank junior to the Class A Loans, the Liquidity Facility and certain hedging arrangements with respect to the application
of enforcement proceeds, other than in respect of the Topco Security (as defined herein). The Topco Payment Undertaking is secured by first-ranking security in respect of all the issued and
outstanding shares of CP Cayman Limited and of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited, together with a floating charge over all of Topco and CP Cayman Limited’s assets, as further described herein.
The Topco Security has been granted for the sole benefit of holders of the Class B Notes.

Application has been made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the Offered Notes to be admitted to the Official List (the “Official List”)
of The International Stock Exchange (the "Exchange"). No assurance can be given that the application will be granted. Furthermore, admission of the Offered Notes to the Official List is not an
indication of the merits of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Offered Notes. There can be no assurance that Offered Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that permission to deal
in the Offered Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. Carey Olsen Corporate Finance Limited is acting solely in its capacity as listing agent for the Issuer in relation to the
Class B6 Notes and is not itself seeking admission of the Class B6 Notes to the Official List.

The issue price of the Class B6 Notes is   %


**Investing in the Offered Notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 39.**


**The Offered Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or the securities laws of any other**
**jurisdiction. Subject to certain exceptions, the Offered Notes may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States, or for the account or benefit of, or to any U.S. persons (as**
**defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act). Accordingly, the Offered Notes are being offered and sold only outside the United States to persons who are not U.S. persons in**
**accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions” for additional information about eligible offerees and transfer restrictions.**

The Issuer is of the opinion that the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 (the “EU Securitisation
**Regulation”) do not apply to the Offered Notes. The Issuer is of the opinion that the requirements of Regulation (EU)**
2017/2402 as it forms part of domestic law of the United Kingdom by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act
2018 (“EUWA”) and the Securitisation (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/660) (the “UK
**Securitisation Regulation”) do not apply to the Offered Notes.**

On issue, it is expected that the Offered Notes will be assigned the respective ratings of S&P Global Ratings
UK Limited (“S&P”) and Fitch Ratings Ltd (“Fitch” and, together with S&P, the “Rating Agencies” and each, a
“Rating Agency”). As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, both Rating Agencies are established in the United
Kingdom and are registered in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 1060/2009 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (the “UK CRA Regulation”). Each of S&P and Fitch is not established in the EEA and has not
applied for registration under Regulation (EC) No. 1060/2009 (as amended) (the “CRA Regulation”). The ratings
issued by S&P have been endorsed by S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited and the ratings issued by Fitch have been
endorsed by Fitch Ratings Ireland Limited in accordance with the CRA Regulation. Each of S&P Global Ratings
Europe Limited and Fitch Ratings Ireland Limited is established in the EEA and registered under the CRA Regulation.
As such, each of S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited and Fitch Ratings Ireland Limited is included in the list of credit
rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority on its website (at
[http://www.esma.europa.eu/page/List-registered-and-certified-CRAs) in accordance with the CRA Regulation. A](https://clicktime.symantec.com/338RGVJJAuMrDzzf1MEKFKJ6H2?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.esma.europa.eu%2Fpage%2FList-registered-and-certified-CRAs)
credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or
withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organisation. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal of any rating may
adversely affect the market price of such securities.

A copy of this Offering Memorandum has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies in Jersey in
accordance with Article 5 of the Companies (General Provisions) (Jersey) Order 2002 and he has given, and has not
withdrawn, his consent to its circulation.

The Jersey Financial Services Commission has given, and has not withdrawn, or will have given prior to the
issuance of the Offered Notes and not withdrawn, its consent under Article 4 of the Control of Borrowing (Jersey)
Order 1958 to the issuance of the Offered Notes.

It must be distinctly understood that, in giving these consents, neither the Registrar of Companies in Jersey
nor the Jersey Financial Services Commission takes any responsibility for the financial soundness of the Issuer or for
the correctness of any statements made, or opinion expressed, with regard to it.

The Jersey Financial Services Commission is protected by the Control of Borrowing (Jersey) Law 1947, as
amended, against liability arising from the discharge of its functions under that law.

It should be remembered that the price of securities and the income from them can go down as well as up.

If you are in any doubt about the contents of this Offering Memorandum you should consult your stockbroker,
bank manager, solicitor, accountant or other financial adviser.

The Issuer expects that delivery of the Offered Notes will be made on the respective Offered Notes on or
about    2021, which will be the    business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange
Act) following the date of pricing of the Offered Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ” (U.S.)).
Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business
days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.

In connection with the issuance of the Offered Notes, Barclays Bank PLC (the “Stabilisation Manager”) or
any person acting on its behalf may, to the extent permitted by all applicable laws, regulations, rules and directives,
over-allot and effect transactions in any over-the-counter market or otherwise in connection with the distribution of
the Offered Notes with a view to supporting the market price of the Offered Notes at a level higher than that which
might otherwise prevail. However, there is no assurance that the Stabilisation Manager (or any agent of the
Stabilisation Manager) will undertake any stabilisation action. Any stabilisation action may begin on or after the date
on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the Offered Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended
at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issuance of the Offered Notes and 60 days
after the date of allotment of the Offered Notes and must be brought to an end after a limited period in compliance
with applicable laws, regulations and rules.

This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to subscribe for or purchase
any of the Offered Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation is not authorised or to any person to

i


-----

whom it is unlawful to make such an offer or invitation. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of
this Offering Memorandum and the offer and sale of the Offered Notes. Persons into whose possession this Offering
Memorandum or any of the Offered Notes are delivered must inform themselves about and observe those restrictions.
Each prospective purchaser of the Offered Notes must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any
jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers or sells the Offered Notes or possesses or distributes this Offering
Memorandum. In addition, each prospective purchaser must obtain any consent, approval or permission required under
the regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it purchases, offers or sells the Offered
Notes. We, the Issuer and the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners shall not have any responsibility
for obtaining such consent, approval or permission.

The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review
or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisors to determine whether and
to what extent (1) the Offered Notes are legal investments for it; (2) the Offered Notes can be used as security for
indebtedness; and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any of the Offered Notes. Financial
institutions should consult their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of
the Offered Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

The information contained under “Exchange Rate Information” includes extracts from information and data
publicly released by official and other sources. While the Issuer accepts responsibility for accurately summarizing the
information concerning exchange rate information, the Issuer accepts no further responsibility in respect of such
information.

**Volcker Rule**

Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and Regulation VV (12 C.F.R. Section
248) promulgated thereunder by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (such statutory provision
together with such implementing regulations, the “Volcker Rule”) generally prohibit “banking entities” (which term
is broadly defined to include any U.S. bank or savings association whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, any company that controls any such bank or savings association, any foreign bank treated as
a bank holding company for purposes of Section 8 of the International Banking Act of 1978, as amended, and any
affiliate or subsidiary of any of the foregoing entities) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading as defined in the Volcker
Rule, (ii) acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in or sponsoring a “covered fund” and (iii) entering into certain
relationships with such funds. Under the Volcker Rule, unless otherwise jointly determined otherwise by specified
federal regulators, a “covered fund” does not include an issuer that may rely on an exclusion or exemption from the
definition of “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment
**Company Act”), other than those contained in Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.**

In 2018, the five bank regulatory agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule issued proposed
amendments to the Volcker Rule regulations not relevant to securitizations, but also asked for comment on potential
future modifications to the Volcker Rule regulations, including modifications to the definition of “covered fund”, to
the requirements of the “loan securitization” exclusion and to the nature of a prohibited “ownership interest” in a
covered fund. On 30 January 2020, these five agencies published proposed revisions (the “Proposed Volcker
**Changes”) based upon the 2018 request for comments. Among other proposals, the Proposed Volcker Changes**
include modifications to (i) permit covered funds relying on the “loan securitization” exclusion to acquire assets that
do not constitute loans or other assets or rights currently permitted under the “loan securitization” exclusion, in an
aggregate amount not to exceed 5% of the aggregate value of the issuing entity’s assets, (ii) exclude from the definition
of “ownership interest” certain “senior loans” or “senior debt interests” issued by a covered fund and (iii) clarify that
the rights either to participate in the removal or replacement of an investment manager for cause (in connection with,
among other things, the bankruptcy, insolvency, conservatorship or receivership of the investment manager, the breach
by the investment manager of any material provision of the covered fund’s transaction agreements applicable to the
investment manager, the breach by the investment manager of material representations or warranties, the occurrence
of an act that constitutes fraud or criminal activity in the performance of the investment manager’s obligations under
the covered fund’s transaction agreements, the indictment of the investment manager for a criminal offense, or the
indictment of any officer, member, partner or other principal of the investment manager for a criminal offense
materially related to his or her investment management activities, a change in control with respect to the investment
manager, and the loss, separation or incapacitation of an individual critical to the operation of the investment manager
or primarily responsible for the management of the covered fund’s assets) would not be a feature that results in a
banking entity having an ownership interest in a covered fund.


-----

On 25 June 2020, the five agencies adopted the bulk of the Proposed Volcker Changes (but with some
modifications), and these changes became active as of 1 October 2020.

The Issuer is not, and after giving effect to any offering and sale of the Offered Notes and the application of
the proceeds thereof will not be, a “covered fund” for purposes of the Volcker Rule. In reaching this conclusion, the
Issuer has determined that the Issuer will not rely solely on Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment
Company Act for its exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act.

The general effects of the Volcker Rule (including the changes adopted in June 2020) remain uncertain. Any
prospective investor in the Offered Notes, including a U.S. or foreign bank or a subsidiary or other affiliate thereof,
should consult its own legal advisors regarding such matters and other effects of the Volcker Rule.

**Notice to U.S. Investors**

The Offered Notes have not been registered, approved or disapproved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”), any state securities commission in the United States or any other U.S. regulatory authority,
nor have any of the foregoing authorities passed upon or endorsed the merits of the Offered Notes or the accuracy or
the adequacy of this Offering Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United
States.

Each purchaser of the Offered Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and
acknowledgments that are described in this Offering Memorandum under “Notice to Investors and Transfer
_Restrictions”. The Offered Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or with any_
securities regulatory authority of any other jurisdiction. The Offered Notes may be offered, sold or delivered only
outside the United States to persons who are not “U.S. persons” as defined in Regulation S (each, a “U.S. person”) in
offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The Offered Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means
a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU
(“MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (“Insurance Distribution Directive”),
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the “PRIIPs Regulation”)
for offering or selling the Offered Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom
or the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Offered Notes or otherwise making them available
to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**MIFID II product governance / target market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Offered Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Offered Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the
Offered Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending the Offered Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Offered Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Notice to Investors in the United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum is directed solely at persons who (i) are investment professionals, as such term
is defined in Article 19(5) of the Financial Promotion Order, (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d)
(“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the
United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or
sale of any Offered Notes may otherwise be lawfully communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons
together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum must not be acted on or relied on by
persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum
relate is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. Any person who is not

i


-----

a relevant person should not act or rely on this Offering Memorandum or any of its contents. The Offered Notes are
not being offered to the public in the United Kingdom.

**Prohibition of Sales to United Kingdom Retail Investors**

The Offered Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a
**retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of:**

(i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations
made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Offered Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling
the Offered Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful
under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**UK MiFIR product governance / target market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Offered Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Offered Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook
(“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Offered Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending
the Offered Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK
**MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of**
the Offered Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**Germany**

The offering of the Offered Notes is not a public offering in the Federal Republic of Germany (“Germany”).
In Germany, the Offered Notes may only be offered and sold in accordance with the provisions of the Securities
Prospectus Act of the Federal Republic of Germany (the “Securities Prospectus Act, **_Wertpapierprospektgesetz,_**
**_WpPG”) and any other applicable German law. No application has been made under German law to offer the Offered_**
Notes to the public in or out of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Offered Notes are not registered or authorized
for distribution under the Securities Prospectus Act and accordingly may not be, and are not being, offered or
advertised publicly or by public promotion. This Offering Memorandum is strictly for private use and the offer is only
being made to recipients to whom this Offering Memorandum is personally addressed and does not constitute an offer
or advertisement to the public. The Issuer has not, and does not intend to, file a securities prospectus with the German
Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (“BaFin”) or obtain a notification to BaFin from another competent authority
of a Member State, with which a securities prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to Section 17 para. 3 of the
Securities Prospectus Act. In Germany, the Offered Notes will only be available to, and this Offering Memorandum
and any other offering material in relation to the Offered Notes is directed only at, persons who are qualified investors
(qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of Section 2 No. 6 of the Securities Prospectus Act or who are subject of
another exemption in accordance with Section 3 para. 2 of the Securities Prospectus Act. Any resale of the Offered
Notes in Germany may only be made in accordance with the Securities Prospectus Act and other applicable laws.

**Austria**

The Offered Notes may only be offered in the Republic of Austria in compliance with the provisions of the
Austrian Capital Market Act (Kapitalmarktgesetz) and other laws applicable in the Republic of Austria governing the
offer and sale of the Offered Notes in the Republic of Austria. The Offered Notes have not been registered or otherwise

ii


-----

authorized for a public offer under either the Austrian Capital Market Act (Kapitalmarktgesetz), the Investment Fund
Act 2011 (Investmentfondsgesetz 2011) or any other Austrian securities law in Austria. Neither this Offering
Memorandum nor any other document in connection with the Offered Notes is a prospectus according to the Austrian
Capital Market Act (Kapitalmarktgesetz), the Stock Exchange Act (Börsegesetz) or the Investment Fund Act 2011
(Investmentfondsgesetz 2011) and has therefore not been drawn up, audited, approved, passported and/or published in
accordance with the aforesaid acts. In Austria, the Offered Notes will only be available to, and this Offering
Memorandum and any other selling material relating to the Offered Notes is directed only at, persons who are qualified
investors (qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of section 1 para. 1 No. 5a of the Austrian Capital Market Act
(Kapitalmarktgesetz). The recipients of this Offering Memorandum and other selling material with respect to the
Offered Notes have been individually selected and identified before the offer is made and are targeted exclusively on
the basis of a private placement. Accordingly, the Offered Notes may not be, and are not being, offered or advertised
publicly or offered similarly in the Republic of Austria. No offer will be made to any persons in Austria other than the
recipients to whom this Offering Memorandum is personally addressed. This Offering Memorandum is distributed
under the condition that the foregoing obligations are accepted by the recipient and that the recipient undertakes to
comply with the above selling and transfer restrictions.

meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French Code monétaire et financier and Title I of Book II of the Réglement Général
of the Autorité des Marches Financiers (the “AMF”) and therefore has not been approved by, registered or filed with
the AMF. The Offered Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, to the public in France and offers and
sales of Offered Notes shall only be made in France to (a) authorised providers of investment services relating to
portfolio management for the account of third parties (personnes fournissant le service d’investissement de gestion de

all as defined in, and in accordance with, Articles L.411-1, L.411-2 and D.411-1 to D.411-3 of the French _Code_
_monétaire et financier. No direct or indirect distribution, transfer or sale of the Offered Notes so acquired shall be_

French Code monétaire et financier.

This offering memorandum or any other circular, prospectus, form of application, advertisement,

2005 relative aux prospectus pour valeurs mobilières, as amended.

condition and liquidity of the Center Parcs Group, and the development of the industry in which the Center Parcs
Group operates, are consistent with the forward-looking statements set out in this Offering Memorandum, those results
or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Many factors could cause
the Center Parcs Group’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,

Deloitte LLP, independent auditor, as stated in their reports included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The
audit reports, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, express an unqualified opinion for each of the
respective audited periods and the audit report in relation to the 2020 Audited Financial Statements includes a material
uncertainty paragraph related to going concern as set forth in Note 1 to such financial statements. See “Summary—
_Recent Developments—Paragraph on Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern in Audit Report.”_

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited adopted IFRS 16, Leases (“IFRS 16”) in the 52-week period ended 25
April 2019 and recognised £2.2 million as a reduction in retained earnings as a result of the adoption. Center Parcs
(Holdings 1) Limited early adopted IFRS 16 by applying the modified retrospective approach, which requires the
cumulative effect of the initial application of IFRS 16 to be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of
retained earnings on 27 April 2018, the date of initial application, without restating prior periods. On adoption of IFRS
16, right of use assets and lease liabilities were brought onto the balance sheet for £30.9 million and £33.1 million,
respectively, and related depreciation charges and finance expense are recognised in the income statement, instead of
operating lease rentals expenses.

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“IFRS
**15”) in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 using the retrospective method and restating the comparative periods.**
The effect of adoption of IFRS 15 as at 20 April 2017 was the deferral of £0.8 million of revenue in respect of certain
promotional activities that was recognised as a liability at the transition date with a corresponding reduction to retained
earnings.

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (“IFRS 9”) in the 52 weeks
period ended 25 April 2019 and in accordance with the standard, the comparative periods were not restated. The
adoption of IFRS 9 on 27 April 2018 did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial statements of Center
Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited.

As a result of the adoption of the above accounting standards, the audited consolidated financial statements
as at and for each of the 52-week periods ended 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 are not directly comparable with the
audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, included in this
Offering Memorandum. The audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the 53-week period ended 26 April
2018 were prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 18, Revenue, IAS 17, Leases and
IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, which were the standards applicable at that time.

**Unaudited “as adjusted” financial information**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain financial information as adjusted to reflect the impact of the
Transactions as at and for the 52-week period ended 31 December 2020 and for the 52-week period from 1 March
2019 to 27 February 2020. For more information on financial information for the 52-week period from 1 March 2019
to 27 February 2020 and applicable adjustments, see “—Reporting Terms” below. The “as adjusted” financial data
has been included to illustrate the effect of the Transactions on the consolidated balance sheet of Center Parcs as if

i


-----

the Transactions had occurred on 31 December 2020, and to illustrate the effect of the Transactions on the consolidated
income statement of Center Parcs as if the Transactions had occurred on 3 January 2020 or, where indicated, on 1
March 2019 or 26 April 2019. The financial information for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020 has not been
prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and has not been audited or reviewed. Moreover, as
certain year-end procedures were not performed in preparing the financial information for the 52-week period ended
27 February 2020, it may not represent the same financial information that would have resulted if Center Parcs had
produced year-end financial statements for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. See “—Reporting Terms”
below. The “as adjusted” financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions
underlying the adjustments nor the resulting adjusted financial information have been audited or reviewed in
accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. The “as adjusted” financial data is presented for illustrative
purposes only and should not be considered a presentation of the actual results of operations that would have been
attained had the Transactions actually occurred at an earlier date or in an earlier period.

The “as adjusted” financial data should be read in conjunction with the information presented in “Use of
_Proceeds”, “Capitalisation” and the audited Center Parcs consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this_
Offering Memorandum.

**Reporting Terms**

The financial year of Center Parcs is divided into 13 four-week periods (in a 53-week financial year, 12 fourweek periods and one five-week period) to enable more meaningful conclusions to be drawn when periods are
compared as all accounting periods contain the same number of days and an equal number of weekend and mid-week
breaks. For existing quarterly reporting purposes, Center Parcs reports at the end of periods three, six, nine and thirteen.
This reporting corresponds to three periods of 12 weeks and one period of 16 weeks in each financial year (17 weeks
in a 53-week financial year). The 2019 and 2020 financial years were 52-week periods; however the 2018 financial
year was a 53-week period. Consequently, unless otherwise indicated, the financial information for the 2018 financial
year includes an additional week, which affects the comparability of results of operations between periods.

References in this Offering Memorandum to:

    - “Financial year 2020” or the “2020 financial year” are to the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020;

    - “Financial year 2019” or the “2019 financial year” are to the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019;
and

    - “Financial year 2018” or the “2018 financial year” are to the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018.

During the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020, the Center Parcs villages were closed from 20 March 2020
to the end of the period and in the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020, all five of the Center Parcs villages were
closed from 24 April 2020 to 13 July 2020, 5 November 2020 to 4 December 2020 and 21 December 2020 to 31
December 2020 and only open with capacity restrictions for the remaining periods and were also subject to localised
closures as a result of the tier restrictions, such as the closure of Sherwood Village from 30 October 2020 and the
closure of Woburn Village from 18 December 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to facilitate
comparability to the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, certain
financial and operational information is presented as of and for the 52-week period from 1 March 2019 to 27 February
2020, which represents the last 52-week period for which management accounts are available and during which all
villages were open and operational without COVID-19 restrictions. Figures for the 52-week period from 1 March
2019 to 27 February 2020 are calculated by adding together the results from the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019
to the results from 26 April 2019 to 27 February 2020 and deducting the results from 27 April 2018 to 28 February
2019. In addition, certain comparative figures are also presented as of and for the 52-week period from 2 March 2018
to 28 February 2019. These comparative figures are calculated by adding together the results from the 53-week period
ended 26 April 2018 to the results from 27 April 2018 to 28 February 2019 and deducting the results from 21 April
2017 to 22 February 2018 and the 53-week Adjustment for the 2018 financial year. The 53-week adjustment for the
financial year 2018 has been calculated by dividing the financial results for the four-week period from 23 February
2018 to 22 March 2018 by four (to represent financial results for a typical off-peak one-week period of financial
results) (the “53-week Adjustment”) and subtracting the 53-week Adjustment from the results for the financial year
ended 26 April 2018.The financial information for the 52-week periods ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February
2019 has been extracted from management accounts. The financial information for the 52-week periods ended 27


-----

February 2020 and 28 February 2019 has been prepared in accordance with IFRS with the exception of certain yearend procedures that were not performed in preparing the financial information for the 52-week periods ended 27
February 2020 and 28 February 2019, and as such they may not represent the same financial information that would
have resulted if Center Parcs had produced year-end financial statements for the 52-week periods ended 27 February
2020 and 28 February 2019, respectively. The financial information for the 52-week periods ended 27 February 2020
and 28 February 2019 has not been audited or reviewed.

The financial years ended 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 were 52-week periods; however, the financial
year ended 26 April 2018 was a 53-week period. This may impact comparability to the 52-week periods ended 23
April 2020 and 25 April 2019.

**_Non-IFRS Financial and Operating Measures_**

_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios, including EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA before exceptional and non-underlying items (referred to as Adjusted EBITDA, as defined
below, in this Offering Memorandum) and leverage and coverage ratios, that are not required by, or presented in
accordance with, IFRS. These measures are not measures of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited’s consolidated
financial performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to (a) operating profit or
profit/(loss) for the period as a measure of operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and
financing activities as a measure of Center Parcs’ ability to meet their cash needs or (c) any other measures of
performance under IFRS.

Center Parcs defines EBITDA as profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders before interest,
taxation, depreciation and amortisation. Center Parcs defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA as defined above, further
adjusted to remove the effects of certain exceptional and non-underlying items that Center Parcs believes are not
indicative of its underlying operating performance. Center Parcs believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are
useful indicators of Center Parcs’ ability to incur and service its indebtedness and may assist investors, security
analysts and other interested parties in evaluating Center Parcs’ financial performance. Management uses Adjusted
EBITDA as the primary profit measure to assess the performance of the operating segments and discloses it within
the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. As all companies do not
calculate EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA on a consistent basis, Center Parcs’ presentation of EBITDA or Adjusted
EBITDA may not be comparable to measures under the same or similar names used by other companies. Accordingly,
undue reliance should not be placed on EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in this Offering Memorandum. EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and investors should not consider them in isolation. Some of
these limitations are that:

    - they do not reflect Center Parcs’ cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments;

    - they do not reflect the changes in, or cash requirements for, Center Parcs’ working capital needs;

    - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments on Center Parcs’ debt;

    - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that Center Parcs may be required to pay;

    - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in Center Parcs’
consolidated income statement;

    - in the case of Adjusted EBITDA (but not EBITDA), it does not reflect the impact of earnings or
charges resulting from certain matters Center Parcs consider not to be indicative of its underlying
operations;

    - assets are depreciated or amortised over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be
replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such
replacements; and

    - other companies in Center Parcs’ industry may calculate these measures differently from the manner
Center Parcs does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

-----

In this Offering Memorandum, except where otherwise indicated, Adjusted EBITDA is presented before
exceptional and other non-underlying items. Exceptional and non-underlying items of £2.2 million for the financial
year ended 23 April 2020 represented £2.0 million in costs to exit a contract and £0.2 million of legal and other
associated costs relating to the equity contribution provided by funds managed by Brookfield. Exceptional and nonunderlying items for the financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented £1.6 million of costs relating to legal health
and safety claims at Woburn Forest and associated settlements, together with £0.7 million of one-off restructuring and
reorganisation costs.

For a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to profit for the period attributable to equity
shareholders, see “Summary Historical Financial and Operating Information”.

In addition, this Offering Memorandum includes the following key performance indicators that Center Parcs’
Directors use to set targets and measure performance against those targets.

_Occupancy_

Occupancy is the average number of units of accommodation occupied as a percentage of the total number
available. Units of accommodation are deemed to be occupied when utilised during the relevant period under review.
When units of accommodation are out of service for refurbishment, they are still included in the occupancy
calculations. Center Parcs is focused on driving occupancy levels to optimise the number of guests, which in turn
increases accommodation revenue and optimises on-site expenditure.

_Average Daily Rate (“ADR”)_

ADR is the average rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total accommodation income for the period
divided by the total number of accommodation nights sold. Center Parcs uses ADR to help measure and maximise its
yield.

_Rent Per Available Lodge night (“RevPAL”)_

RevPAL is the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on the total accommodation income
divided by the total available number of accommodation nights. Center Parcs’ management believes RevPAL to be
the most meaningful key performance indicator because it takes into account both occupancy and ADR.

_Net on-site guest spend per lodge night_

Net on-site guest spend per lodge night is calculated as on-site spend at Center Parcs-operated units and the
rent received from concession partners (i.e. on-site revenue) for a period, divided by the sum of the number of guestoccupied lodges during each night of such period.

_Forward bookings as a percentage of available capacity_

Forward bookings as a percentage of available capacity means the number of accommodation nights sold
divided by total available accommodation nights for the period. This indicator provides management with forward
visibility of future occupancy levels.

_Cash conversion_

Cash conversion is defined as Adjusted EBITDA for a period less maintenance capital expenditure made in
such period plus working capital and non-cash movements (less difference between the pension charge and
contribution) in such period, expressed as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA. This indicator helps management
measure the cash generated by Center Parcs’ core operations.

Center Parcs defines maintenance capital expenditure as the capital expenditure required on the central
buildings, infrastructure and facilities to maintain the ongoing standards of these areas.

**SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights certain information about the Center Parcs Group and the Offered Notes described_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. This overview is not complete and does not contain all the information the_
_investors should consider before investing in the Offered Notes. The summary should be read in conjunction with, and_
_is qualified in its entirety by, the more detailed information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum,_
_including the audited consolidated financial statements. This Offering Memorandum should be read carefully to_
_understand the business, the nature and terms of the Offered Notes and the tax and other considerations which are_
_important to the decision to invest in the Offered Notes, including, without limitation, the risks discussed under “Risk_
_Factors”. In addition, certain statements in this overview include forward-looking information that involves risks and_
_uncertainties. See “Forward-Looking Statements”._

**OVERVIEW**

Center Parcs is a leading UK short-break holiday business, attracting over 2.1 million guests in the 52-week
period ended 27 February 2020. Center Parcs operates five specially constructed holiday villages in the United
Kingdom: Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Elveden Forest in Suffolk, Whinfell
Forest in Cumbria (the “Original Villages”) and Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire. Each village is set in a forest
environment amongst approximately 400 acres of forest around a lake and is open 365 days per year.

Woodland, water and a natural environment make up the essential environment of a Center Parcs break.
Within this comfortable, quiet, car-free and family-friendly setting, each of the Center Parcs villages provides guests
with high quality accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. In total, as of 31 December 2020, there
were 4,335 units of accommodation across its five villages, which could accommodate approximately 22,958 guests
per day at 100% occupancy. The focal point and key attraction of each village is an all-weather indoor sub-tropical
swimming paradise, featuring a selection of water activities including a wave pool, river slides and rides, children’s
pools and Jacuzzis. Center Parcs’ on-site experiences also include outdoor activities such as cycling, boating and zip
wires; indoor activities such as ten-pin bowling, badminton and pottery; and amenities such as spas, food and beverage
and retail. A significant proportion of Center Parcs’ revenue is generated from guests’ on-site spending, including for
leisure and spa activities, food and beverage and retail, representing 39.2% of total revenue in financial year 2020.

Center Parcs has a well-established brand in the UK, renowned for providing high quality experiences and
facilities, targeting a primary guest base of affluent families. Center Parcs benefits from strong guest loyalty with
approximately 34% of guests returning within 14 months and approximately 54% of guests returning over a five-year
period as of financial year 2020. In addition, Center Parcs believes that its business model is difficult to replicate due
to the lack of suitable locations for the development of holiday parks and high development costs while Center Parcs
is well positioned to continue to grow its business.

Center Parcs’ villages typically draw on a regional population of guests who are attracted to the convenience
of being within a relatively short driving distance from home. Over 90% of the UK population lives within a 2.5 hour
drive of at least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two hour drive of
the village they choose to visit. Center Parcs believes that the proximity of the majority of guests to its villages
combined with the easy accessibility of the villages by car make Center Parcs a popular and convenient short break
holiday option. Occupancy levels at Center Parcs’ villages have been consistently high: 97.6% in financial year 2018,
97.1% in financial year 2019, and 97.3% in the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. Occupancy levels have
averaged approximately 96% in the last 15 years to 27 February 2020, and approximately 97% in the last eight years
to 27 February 2020, despite the expansion of existing accommodation offerings at Center Parcs’ Original Villages
and the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014. However, as a result of village closures and occupancy restrictions in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall occupancy level at Center Parcs’ villages for the 36-week period
ended 31 December 2020 was 30.5%.

For the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, Center Parcs had revenue of £496.3 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of £239.4 million, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.2%.

In each of the financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have been
broadly evenly split amongst Center Parcs’ villages, reflecting both the individual strength of each village and the
diversity of Center Parcs’ asset base.

With the exception of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have
consistently grown over the past ten years. Total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were £496.3 million and
£239.4 million, respectively, for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. Adjusted EBITDA margins grew from
42.4% in financial year 2008 to 48.2% in the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020.

activities and an indoor sub-tropical swimming paradise. Each village has on average 867 units of accommodation
with capacity for approximately 4,590 guests. Center Parcs believes that it is the only large-scale UK business offering
this type of high quality family-focused, year-round, all-weather, short-break package, in a forest environment. Center
Parcs believes that it is well-positioned to benefit from pent-up demand for domestic travel as a result of the COVID19 pandemic lasting for over a year, with its villages typically drawing on a regional population of guests who live
within a relatively short driving distance. In a recent customer survey of approximately 4,000 guests on 5 March 2021,
only 3% of respondents stated that they did not intend to take a domestic holiday or short break in the next twelve
months. Further, the design of Center Parcs’ villages lends itself well to social distancing, as most guests travel to the
villages in their own cars, the lodges provide for self-catering, the villages are spread out over a large open footprint
and many of the activities are outdoors.

**Difficult to replicate concept with well-known brand and loyal, affluent customer base.**

The Center Parcs villages are characterised by a number of qualities that Center Parcs believes make its
business model difficult to replicate in the United Kingdom. These include:

    - limited appropriate sites for villages, which require large forested areas near major population
centres;

    - long lead time needed to develop new villages due to the stringent requirements for obtaining
planning permits;

    - significant initial investment cost in addition to on-going capital expenditure required for further
development and operations of the business; and

    - a wide range of specialised operations and planning expertise required to develop and operate a
village.

Center Parcs’ unique product offering has generated strong brand recognition and guest loyalty. Center Parcs
believes that it has high brand recognition in the UK and is considered among the top brands for high quality short
breaks in the UK.

Center Parcs’ “intention to return” score was 95% in financial year 2020. Approximately 34% of Center
Parcs’ guests return within 14 months and approximately 54% return over a five-year period. Center Parcs’ active
marketable guest base was approximately 309,000 households in 2020.

In 2020, Aqua Sana Whinfell Forest was awarded Best Community Spa by Good Spa Awards. Aqua Sana
Longleat Forest and Aqua Sana Woburn Forest also won accolades from the Professional Beauty Awards, with Aqua
Sana Longleat Forest being awarded South West and Wales Spa of the Year and Large Spa of the Year, and Aqua
Sana Woburn Forest winning South East Spa of the Year. In 2019, three of Center Parcs’ Aqua Sana spas were
shortlisted for Good Spa Awards, and Aqua Sana Sherwood Forest was awarded Best Destination Spa in the UK.
Aqua Sana Sherwood Forest had previously been awarded Best Spa in the East Midlands and the East in November
2018.

Center Parcs’ guest profile has remained stable over time and consists of the highest earning categories of
the UK population. According to management estimates, Center Parcs ranked significantly over index in a number of
the Experian high end consumer classifications, with 57% of guests in financial year 2019 identified under the
Experian Mosaic classification as “Domestic Success”, “Prestige Positions” or “Aspiring Homemakers” based on
postcode analysis.

**Resilient growth through economic cycles.**

Resilient performance through economic cycles, during both downturns and recoveries, and also through
additions in capacity, has resulted in Center Parcs’ occupancy levels averaging over 90% over the last 20 years to
27 February 2020, approximately 96% in the last 15 years to 27 February 2020 and approximately 97% in the last
eight years to 27 February 2020, with occupancy levels of 97.6%, 97.1% and 97.3% in financial years 2018 and 2019
and the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, respectively. Occupancy at each of the villages has historically
remained high even after the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014 despite an approximately 20% increase in Center
Parcs’ accommodation available, demonstrating the depth of demand for Center Parcs’ villages. Despite the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic conditions as well as on guests’ willingness to travel, and the restrictions on
Center Parcs’ ability to operate at full capacity following the initial re-opening of the villages on 13 July 2020, demand

**Consistent revenue growth with strong visibility through forward-booking model.**

With the exception of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in financial years 2020 and 2021, Center Parcs
experienced revenue growth each year over the previous ten years, with revenue growing at a CAGR of 5.5% from
financial year 2008 to the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. In addition, Center Parcs’ Adjusted EBITDA has
grown at a CAGR of 6.6% from financial year 2008 to the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. Center Parcs
places a strong emphasis on advance prepaid bookings, which result in significant revenue visibility, with an average
of 19 weeks’ booking-to-arrival time in financial years 2018 to 2020. For each of financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020,
an average of approximately 43% of the available accommodation nights had been booked by the beginning of the
financial year, an average of 59% by the end of the first quarter, an average of 76% halfway through the financial
year, and an average of 95% two months before the end of the financial year.

Under its standard terms and conditions, Center Parcs collects 30% of the accommodation cost at the time of
booking if completed more than ten weeks in advance of the short break. The balance of the cost is collected ten weeks
prior to the start of the break. If a guest books less than ten weeks prior to the arrival date, the accommodation cost is
payable in full on booking. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some changes have been made to these conditions,
but a reversion to standard terms and conditions is expected. Similarly, in the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020,
more than 64% of leisure and spa activities were pre-booked and pre-paid prior to arrival. This significant revenue
visibility allows Center Parcs to optimise its cost structure according to anticipated occupancy levels and demand
throughout the year.

**Sustainable cash flow generation.**

With the exception of the periods impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs’ EBITDA margins
have been underpinned by high occupancy levels and consistent growth in ADR. Relatively high EBITDA margins
combined with the negative working capital characteristics of the business due to its forward-booking model and the
relatively low maintenance capital expenditure requirements, which averaged £21.1 million per financial year from
financial year 2008 to financial year 2020, has enabled Center Parcs to be highly cash generative, with cash conversion
(defined as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure plus working capital and non-cash movements
(less difference between the pension charge and contribution), expressed as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA) in
excess of 85% in each of financial years 2018 and 2019 and the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, at 94.1%,
91.2%, and 87.4%, respectively. In addition, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, all guests impacted by a closure
have had the option to change dates with £100 discount or cancel and claim a full refund. The £100 discount offer has
continued to see a high level of uptake, with over 50% of guests over the course of the most recent lockdown from 21
December 2020 to 11 April 2021 choosing this option rather than cancelling their booking. During the COVID-19
pandemic, Brookfield reiterated its commitment to Center Parcs through equity contributions of £120.0 million,
comprising £41.5 million received in April 2020, £27.5 million received in May 2020 and £51.0 million received in
February 2021 and the Intercompany Account Advance of £70 million received on 14 July 2020. These commitments
are part of a total of £230 million of financial support available to Center Parcs that has been approved by the
Brookfield funds, with the balance of £40 million available to Center Parcs and CP Ireland, if required.

**Well-invested, diversified and high-quality asset base.**

Center Parcs owns all five of its UK villages on either freehold titles or long leasehold titles, and with
remaining lease terms of between 53 years and 980 years, Center Parcs’ asset base has a long life and is diversified
and stable. In financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have been broadly
evenly split amongst its villages, located in different parts of the UK, reflecting both the individual strength of each
village and the diversity of Center Parcs’ asset base.

Center Parcs has an on-going capital expenditure programme to maintain and enhance the quality of its asset
base, pursuant to which it has invested approximately £724 million from financial year 2008 through financial year
2020. Of this investment, £279 million represents maintenance capital expenditures. The remainder represents
investment capital expenditure, of which £212 million was invested to upgrade existing accommodation, £100 million

was invested to build new developments, £116 million was invested in on-site development, including new leisure
activities, food and beverage offerings and facilities upgrades and £17 million was invested in its Digital Roadmap
project. In addition, Center Parcs incurred approximately £250 million of total initial development costs in respect of
building Woburn Forest.

Since the acquisition of Center Parcs by the Brookfield Funds in August 2015, the amount of total capital
expenditure has increased from £43 million (of which investment capital expenditure: £19 million) in financial year
2015 to £84.5 million (of which investment capital expenditure: £59 million), £66.1 million (of which investment
capital expenditure: £39 million) and £52.8 million (of which investment capital expenditure: £25 million) in financial
years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, reflecting Brookfield’s commitment to the business and focus on a range of
capital investment opportunities to further grow the business. In financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, the construction
of new build accommodation comprised approximately £25 million, £10 million and £6 million, respectively, of
investment capital expenditure, while a range of ongoing village refurbishments of accommodation, restaurants, retail
outlets, spas and other offerings and facilities comprised the remainder.

**Experienced management team with a track record of innovation.**

Center Parcs has an experienced management team with a proven ability to execute its business plans and
achieve results. In addition, Center Parcs’ management team has a track record of innovation reflected in its yield
management initiatives, innovation in on-site activities and food and beverage offerings, as well as development of
new types of accommodation to help drive ADR. In 2014, the management team successfully opened Woburn Forest
on time and on budget. With an average length of service of over 15 years by individual members of its management
team, the management team is highly experienced in providing the services that set Center Parcs apart from other UK
leisure and holiday providers. Center Parcs also benefits from the operational expertise, relationships, and
management experience of Brookfield.

**STRATEGIES**

**Continue to grow revenue through yield management, flexible pricing, targeted marketing and customer**
**relationship management.**

Center Parcs actively manages pricing across its villages to maintain its high level of occupancy and to
optimise yield during periods of high demand. All bookings are made directly with Center Parcs, with approximately
87% of accommodation bookings made online in financial year 2020. Together with its strong emphasis on advance
bookings (average 19 weeks’ booking-to-arrival time period in financial years 2018 to 2020), this provides Center
Parcs with significant operational information, allowing it to respond quickly to customer trends in order to optimise
its pricing. Center Parcs will continue to operate a flexible pricing model to further grow revenue, and to develop its
customer relationship management initiatives to increase demand from the affluent families that form its core guest
base. Following the reopening of the villages on 12 April 2021, Center Parcs’ villages were operating at approximately
75% capacity as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Capacity levels will be reviewed in due course pursuant
to government guidelines and health and safety considerations, and Center Parcs is currently targeting a return to
nearly full capacity by the end of summer 2021.

Center Parcs’ guest database of approximately 309,000 active guests allows it to undertake targeted
marketing campaigns using a range of channels, including direct mailings, online and digital marketing, television
campaigns and email programmes focused on both existing customers and targeted acquisition of new affluent
families.

**Continue to invest in revenue-enhancing upgrades of Center Parcs accommodation offering and to expand**
**available capacity.**

Center Parcs plans to continue to invest in upgrading the accommodation and facilities in its villages, and to
introduce new accommodation and on-site activities. Since 2007, Center Parcs has opened over 230 new units of
accommodation at its Original Villages, and significantly upgraded all units of accommodation at the Original Villages
at an average estimated cost of approximately £50,000 per lodge. Following the upgrade of all existing units of
accommodation, Center Parcs has started a cycle of refurbishment for such accommodation which is important to
maintain quality and generate repeat business and 2,347 units of accommodation have been upgraded as of the date
of this Offering Memorandum.

There is also capacity for additional new builds of premium lodges at Center Parcs’ villages, which typically
achieve a premium over the rate achieved on standard lodges. Center Parcs believes that such premium lodges attract

7


-----

affluent guests who are more likely to be high on-site spenders. Center Parcs currently has planning permission to
build a further 103 units of accommodation. The new units of accommodation are expected to include waterside
lodges, apartments and other executive lodges.

**Disciplined investment in village experience.**

Center Parcs believes that there are several substantial development projects that could profitably expand
Center Parcs’ offering, including Project Atlantis, which involves the strategic enhancement of the signature subtropical swimming paradise that features at each village. Center Parcs spent approximately £38 million between 2012
and 2020 on implementing Project Atlantis. Improvements included the addition of a new raft ride, the Tropical
Cyclone, and a new play area featuring numerous slides and water feature at Elveden Forest, Longleat Forest and
Sherwood Forest. Over the next two years, Center Parcs plans to make similar upgrades to the pool facilities at
Whinfell Forest. Center Parcs has also invested approximately £6.5 million in the refurbishment and expansion of the
Aqua Sana spa facility at Longleat Forest.

Center Parcs also intends to introduce new leisure activities at each village on a regular basis, as well as
innovate upon its existing offering of leisure activities. Development opportunities include introducing zip wires,
electric boats and expanding indoor climbing activities to all villages. Center Parcs believes that such investments
provide an enriched holiday experience particularly for the affluent families that form its core guest base, and that an
improved on-site unique offering helps to drive both accommodation and on-site revenue.

**Grow on-site spend.**

Center Parcs generated 40.3%, 39.5% and 39.2% of its total revenue from on-site spend in the financial years
2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. As Center Parcs’ guests typically remain on-site for the duration of their stay,
Center Parcs believes that there are opportunities to grow on-site spend further. For example, Center Parcs has
continued to develop a programme of enhanced differentiation in pricing where prices of various offerings are
expected to become flexible across seasons, days of the week and times of day to more accurately reflect guest demand.

Center Parcs has franchise, licensing and concession agreements with various providers. These concession
partners enable guests to benefit from high street brand offerings and Center Parcs to increase profitability through
increased on-site spend. Center Parcs reviews these agreements periodically to ensure that they remain economically
attractive and meet its guests’ requirements.

**Continue to increase profitability through controlling costs.**

Center Parcs benefits from having a flexible cost base. Because of the high level of forward booking visibility
of the business, Center Parcs is typically able to manage its cost base effectively to meet its business requirements. As
part of the strategy to seek profitable growth, it intends to continue to generate cost savings through increased
efficiency at each village and at its head office.

During the closure of Center Parcs’ villages, Center Parcs ensured stringent cost controls and implemented
strict cash management procedures to conserve liquidity, including the rephasing of capital investment projects and
cessation of non-essential operating activities. Center Parcs reduced capital expenditure by ceasing and rephasing nonessential capital projects as closures were announced. Center Parcs estimates that approximately 37.5% of its total
capital expenditure has been rephased for financial year 2021. In addition, Center Parcs also participated in a number
of UK government support measures for businesses to reduce the impact of the closures on its liquidity. Center Parcs
deferred VAT payments and furloughed up to 90% of its employees in accordance with the UK government’s CJRS
scheme. Center Parcs also utilised the 12-month business rates holiday available to retail, hospitality and leisure
businesses and expects to utilise the further 3-month business rates holiday from April 2021 to June 2021, and the
maximum £2.0 million of business rate relief from July onwards. Together, these actions reduced operating expenses
by approximately £14 million on average per four-week period, or approximately 70%, to approximately £6 to £7
million on average per four-week period from 24 April 2020 to 18 June 2020 and 21 December 2020 to 25 February
2021, representing a closed period, as compared to approximately £20 million on average per four-week period from
26 April 2019 to 27 February 2020, representing a typical operating period. Operating expenses gradually increased
in the lead up to the re-opening of the villages on 12 April 2021.

Following the reopening of Center Parcs’ villages on 12 April 2021, Center Parcs expects to continue to
focus on cost efficiency and optimisation while complying with new regulations and ensuring the safety of its guests
and employees. Center Parcs expects its operating costs to be higher in the short-term due to the implementation of
additional health and safety procedures pursuant to government guidelines related to COVID-19.

**Recent Developments**

**Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic**

The disruptions to Center Parcs’ operations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”) have
had, and continue to have, a material negative impact on Center Parcs’ financial condition and results of operations.
The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in an unprecedented global response to contain the spread of the disease. The
UK government, advised by medical and scientific advisers, continually updates the guidance it is issuing to deal with
a rapidly evolving landscape. COVID-19 presents specific challenges to businesses in the leisure, hospitality and retail
sectors, with the introduction of travel and other restrictions.

On 16 March 2020 the UK Government announced wide ranging measures to limit all non-essential social
contact; it advised against non-essential travel, and it asked the public to avoid hotels, restaurants, theatres and social
venues and set out a range of other measures and guidance. Following the guidance and advice issued by the UK
Government, Center Parcs took the decision to close its five holiday villages in the United Kingdom with effect from
20 March 2020 and the holiday villages remained closed until 13 July 2020. Since this initial closure period, as a result
of subsequent government measures and restrictions, Center Parcs closed its five holiday villages from 5 November
2020 to 4 December 2020 and from 21 December 2020 to 11 April 2021 and some of its villages were also subject to
localised closures as a result of the tier restrictions.

Since reopening all of its five villages on 12 April 2021, Center Parcs has implemented significant operational
changes in accordance with government health and safety regulations, which are largely a continuation of the measures
it took following the initial reopening on 13 July 2020. Center Parcs’ villages reopened at approximately 75% capacity,
which is also the current capacity as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, with gradual increases in capacity
planned up to near full occupancy at the end of summer 2021. Capacity levels will be reviewed in due course pursuant
to government guidelines and health and safety considerations. Center Parcs continues to employ an enhanced cleaning
regime throughout the villages, including hand sanitisation stations, deep cleaning of accommodation between
departing and arriving guests and increased cleaning and disinfection of public areas. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the sub-tropical swimming paradise is closed, and many indoor activities are suspended. Center Parcs’
hotel rooms and apartments are also currently not available for use, and the food and beverage offerings at our villages
are limited to takeaways and self-catering with some outdoor beverage service available on terraces.

Currently, it is planned that in Step 3 of the government’s roadmap out of lockdown, no sooner than 17 May
2021, Center Parcs’ restaurants will be open for table service, the hotels/apartments will be available for use and the
subtropical swimming paradise will be open to guests. In Step 4, Center Parcs plans to re-open all of its facilities fully
no sooner than 17 June 2021, to ensure that it can operate in a COVID-19-secure manner. Center Parcs continues to
review and amend its operating procedures, prioritising guest and employee safety. As of 16 April 2021, bookings for
financial year 2022 were 52.1% sold, including bookings that have been moved to a later date from the COVID-19
Closure Periods, as compared to 41.6% of bookings for financial year 2020 as at the same point in April 2019 (and
36.2% in April 2020, which was impacted by COVID-19-related cancellations). Historically, at the end of each
financial year, approximately 40% of the bookings for Center Parcs’ villages for the following financial year have
been sold. Therefore, the current rate of bookings for financial year 2022 is ahead of Center Parcs’ historical
expectations.

Whilst the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic are not clear, Center Parcs has been taking and
continues to take decisive and reasonable steps to manage its business and cost base to maintain cashflow.
Management has undertaken a number of actions available to it to preserve cash and maintain liquidity, including
having:

    - ceased non-essential operating expenditure;

    - reviewed and rephased non-essential capital investment projects as closures were announced, with
an estimated 37.5% of total capital expenditure rephased over the financial year 2021;

    - negotiated a 12-month business rates holiday, a further 3-month business rates holiday from April
2021 to June 2021 and a maximum £2.0 million of business rate relief from July 2021 onwards; and

    - furloughed approximately 90% of the Group’s employees during each of the Closure Periods and
reduced the salaries of directors by 25% during the first lockdown period from 20 March 2020 to
13 July 2020.

-----

Together, these actions reduced operating expenses by approximately £14 million on average per four-week
period, or approximately 70%, to approximately £6 to £7 million on average per four-week period from 24 April 2020
to 18 June 2020 and 21 December 2020 to 25 February 2021, representing a closed period, compared to approximately
£20 million on average per four-week period from 26 April 2019 to 27 February 2020, representing a typical operating
period.

Brookfield has, throughout this period, demonstrated its ongoing support and commitment to Center Parcs’
business. Brookfield (through its fund, BSREP II Center Parcs Jersey Limited) provided the Center Parcs Group,
which is one of the largest investments in the BSREP II fund, with £41.5 million in April 2020, £27.5 million in May
2020 and £51.0 million in February 2021 in equity contributions.

On 14 July 2020, the Brookfield Funds provided an advance of £70 million (the “Intercompany Account
**Advance”) to CP Opco under an intercompany account agreement (the “Intercompany Account Agreement”) to**
continue to support Center Parcs during the COVID-19 pandemic. These commitments are part of a total of £230
million of financial support available to Center Parcs that has been approved by the Brookfield funds, with the balance
of £40 million available to Center Parcs and CP Ireland if required.

In spite of these actions, the closure of Center Parcs’ villages unsurprisingly had a negative effect on Center
Parcs’ earnings. Center Parcs did not record any revenue from holidays that would have taken place during the Closure
Periods. During the periods the villages were open to guests, they operated with limited capacity and were also subject
to localised closures as a result of the tier restrictions, such as the closure of Sherwood Village from 30 October 2020
and the closure of Woburn Village from 18 December 2020, in both cases until Center Parcs’ 12 April 2021 reopening. As a result, Center Parcs’ revenue was adversely impacted, with revenue of £114.9 million in the 36 weeks
ended 31 December 2020 as compared to £360.2 million in the 36 weeks ended 2 January 2020. In addition, Center
Parcs offered guests who had booked holidays for the Closure Periods the option of a refund for their holiday or
postponing their break to later dates, with a £100 financial incentive offered to guests choosing to postpone. A majority
of guests sought refunds for their break, which resulted in an adverse impact to Center Parcs’ liquidity and cash flow.
Center Parcs also has utilised UK government support initiatives including the business rates’ holiday and the UK
government’s CJRS. Center Parcs has reduced prices in response to the temporarily reduced VAT rate of 5%
applicable to leisure businesses. Nevertheless, management believes that the underlying liquidity position of Center
Parcs remains healthy. As at 15 April 2021, Center Parcs had £79.4 million in cash and cash equivalents at the bank.
In addition, Center Parcs has access to a £90 million undrawn committed liquidity facility, which is available to pay
certain expenses in connection with its senior obligations and the Class A Note interest.

Although Fitch affirmed the Issuer’s credit rating on 18 June 2020 and S&P affirmed the BBB credit rating
of the Issuer’s Class A Notes on 16 July 2020, the credit rating of the Issuer’s Class B Notes was downgraded to Bon 16 July 2020 by S&P. The downgrade may impact the Issuer’s (and therefore Center Parcs’) access to capital and
the cost of any debt financings.

**Paragraph on Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern in Audit Report**

The audit report in relation to the 2020 Audited Financial Statements contains a material uncertainty
paragraph in relation to going concern. As described in Note 1 to the 2020 Audited Financial Statements, as a result
of the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on both Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited directly and the wider travel,
hospitality and leisure industry, there is uncertainty in relation to forecasting the nature and extent of government and
social distancing restrictions that would impact the villages, the impact of consumer sentiment and hence the length
of time it will take to achieve a full recovery, uncertainty in relation to the ability of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited
to secure additional funding which may be required in certain scenarios and uncertainty over the ability of Center
Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited to obtain waivers for any forecast potential breach of financial covenants. These events or
conditions, along with the other matters as set forth in Note 1 to the 2020 Audited Financial Statements, indicate that
a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and its subsidiaries’
ability to continue as a going concern on F-22.

**Current trading**

As discussed above under “—The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic”, all of the Group’s villages
successfully re-opened on 12 April 2021, following the closure of all villages on 21 December 2020. The villages
initially reopened with restricted capacity of 75%, with gradual increases in capacity planned up to near full capacity
at the end of summer 2021.

As of 16 April 2021, bookings for financial year 2022 were 52.1% sold, including bookings that have been
moved from the COVID-19 Closure Periods, as compared to 41.6% of bookings for financial year 2020 as at the same
point in April 2019 (and 36.2% in April 2020, where the villages were closed due to COVID-19). Historically, at the
end of each financial year, approximately 40% of the bookings for Center Parcs’ villages for the following financial
year have been sold. Therefore, the current rate of bookings for financial year 2022 is ahead of Center Parcs’ historical
expectations.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**Issuance of the Offered Notes, repayment of the Class B3 Loan and redemption of the Class B3 Notes**

On the Seventh Closing Date, the Issuer expects to issue £255,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Class
B6 Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2051 (the “Class B6 Notes” or the “Offered Notes”). Subject to the terms of the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer will make available to the Borrowers on the Seventh Closing
Date a secured term loan Class B6 facility in an aggregate principal amount of £255,000,000 (the “Class B6 Facility”
and the advance thereunder, the “Class B6 Loan”).

On the Seventh Closing Date, the Borrowers and the Issuer intend to use £250,000,000 of the proceeds of the
Class B6 Loan to prepay a corresponding portion of the principal amount outstanding under the Class B3 Loan so as
to enable a redemption by the Issuer of a corresponding portion of the Class B3 Notes (but not including the payment
of any prepayment premium and accrued and unpaid interest). The remaining £5,000,000 of the proceeds of the Class
B6 Loan will be applied to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the Transactions, including the prepayment

Borrowers. The Issuer will apply the proceeds of such prepayment to redeem the Class B3 Notes in full on or about
the Seventh Closing Date. The redemption of the Class B3 Notes is referred to in this Offering Memorandum as the
“Refinancing”.

On the Closing Date, the Issuer, the Initial Borrowers, the Guarantors and

**Agreement”).**

On the Fourth Closing Date, the Issuer funded the Class B3 Loan under

-----

(the “Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date”). If, on the Class B6
Loan Expected Maturity Date, the Class B6 Loan remains outstanding,
Topco will undertake, under the terms of the Topco Payment
Undertaking, to procure the payment of an amount equal to the aggregate
of: (a) the then principal balance of the Class B Loans; (b) accrued but
unpaid interest outstanding in respect of the Class B Loans; and (c) all
other amounts outstanding under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement. See “— Topco Payment Undertaking; Topco Security”.

**_Final maturity of the Class B6 Notes: ....._** The Issuer is required to redeem the Class B6 Notes in full on the Class

B6 Note Final Maturity Date, being 28 August 2051.

**_Final maturity of the Class B6 Loan: ....._** The final maturity date in respect of the Class B6 Loan will be the later

of (a) the Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date; and (b) the earliest of:
(i) the date on which all amounts outstanding under the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement have been irrevocably paid or
discharged in full; (ii) the date on which the Class A Loans are
accelerated; and (iii) the Loan Interest Payment Date falling in August
2051 (the “Class B6 Loan Final Maturity Date”).

**_Interest on the Class B6 Notes: ..............._** For the Class B6 Notes,   % per annum from (and including) the Seventh

Closing Date up to (but excluding) the Note Interest Payment Date falling
in August 2027 (the “Class B6 Note Step-Down Date”) and, thereafter,
% per annum (each, as applicable, a “Class B6 Note Interest Rate”).

If on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the Issuer receives a payment of
interest (whether in whole or in part) on a Class B6 Loan, from the
Borrowers in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement, then the Issuer will be obliged to make a corresponding
payment of interest (in whole or in part, as the case may be) on the Class
B6 Notes on the corresponding Note Interest Payment Date. If on any
Note Interest Payment Date, the amount received by the Issuer in respect
of a payment of interest on the Class B6 Loan is not sufficient to pay the
interest accrued on the Class B6 Notes, during the immediately preceding
Note Interest Period in full, the amount of interest accrued up to any such
Note Interest Payment Date that is not paid by the Issuer on such Note
Interest Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred
interest, being a “Deferred Interest Amount”) and such Deferred
Interest Amount shall continue to accrue interest at the then applicable
Class B6 Note Interest Rate, as relevant, until it is paid by the Issuer in
full.

If on any Loan Interest Payment Date:

(i) the Issuer receives a payment of interest on the Class B6 Loan
from the Borrower in accordance with the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in excess of the amount of
interest accrued on the Class B6 Notes during the immediately
preceding Note Interest Period; and

(ii) on such Note Interest Payment Date, a Deferred Interest Amount
in respect of any prior Note Interest Period remains outstanding,

then the Issuer shall apply such excess to reduce the then outstanding
Deferred Interest Amount. Interest and the aggregate amount of all
Deferred Interest Amounts then unpaid on the Class B6 Notes and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable by the Issuer
in pounds sterling on the Class B6 Note Final Maturity Date.

18


-----

**_Interest on the Class B6 Loan: ................_** % per annum from (and including) the Seventh Closing Date up to

(but excluding) the Loan Interest Payment Date falling in August 2027
(the “Class B6 Loan Step-Down Date”) and, thereafter,    % per annum
(each, as applicable, a “Class B6 Interest Rate”).

From (and including) the Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date, interest
will accrue on the Class B6 Loan at the applicable Class B6 Interest Rate
until (but excluding) the Class B Loan Final Maturity Date) but such
accruing interest will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest
being a “Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amount”) and such Class
B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amount will accrue interest at the applicable
Class B6 Interest Rate until paid by the Borrowers in full. On each Loan
Interest Payment Date, interest accrued on the Class B6 Loan Deferred
Interest Amount during the immediately preceding Loan Interest Period
will be added to the then outstanding Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest
Amount and thereafter paid at the times and in the same manner as the
Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amount. The Class B6 Loan Deferred
Interest Amount and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon will be
payable by the Borrowers only on the earlier of (x) the date on which the
Class A Loans are repaid in full (the “Initial Payment Date”) and (y) the
Class B6 Note Final Maturity Date; provided that if on the Initial
Payment Date, the Borrowers do not have sufficient cash to pay the Class
B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon in full on such date in accordance with the Borrower Priorities of
Payments, any unpaid Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon will not fall due then but will continue
to be deferred and will only fall due for payment on any subsequent Loan
Interest Payment Date to the extent of the cash available to the Borrowers
for such purpose determined in accordance with the Borrower Priorities
of Payments.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Class B6 Loan, any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon, any Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amounts
and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon may be repaid prior to the
Class B6 Note Final Maturity Date if (i) the Borrowers receive New
Equity Funds (as defined in “Description of the Class B6 Loan”), (ii) the
Topco Security is enforced and proceeds thereof are available for this
purpose and/or (iii) the Transaction Security is enforced and funds are
available for this purpose pursuant to the applicable Priorities of
Payments as described under “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement”, and the Issuer will be_
required to make the corresponding payments of interest on the Class B6
Notes using the proceeds of such payments made by (directly or
indirectly, or on behalf of) the Borrowers.

**_Cash Lock-Up: ........................................._** If at any time the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is not satisfied

(including if the Class A FCF DSCR falls below 135%) or a Waiver End
Date Certificate has not been provided to the Borrower Security Trustee
then no payments (including payments of interest) may be made in
respect of the Class B Loans and, consequently, the Class B Notes, unless
funded out of new equity or, on or prior to the Financial Covenant Test
Date occurring in February 2022 (for so long as a Waiver End Date
Certificate has not been delivered), the proceeds of a Class B Loan
provided that the aggregate amount of the proceeds of any Class B Loan
that is applied to pay interest in respect of the Class B Loans may not
exceed £75 million. See “Description of other Indebtedness — Class A
_Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement”_

19

**_Class B6 Note Interest Payment Dates: .._** Semi-annually in each year on 28 February and 28 August, subject to

adjustment for non-Business Days commencing on 28 August 2021 (the
“Note Interest Payment Dates” and each, a “Note Interest Payment
**Date”).**

**_Class B6 Loan Interest Payment Dates: ._** Each day falling three Business Days prior to a Note Interest Payment

Date (the “Loan Interest Payment Dates” and each a “Loan Interest
**Payment Date”).**

**_Security for the Class B6 Notes: .............._** The Class B6 Notes will be secured on a subordinated basis by first
ranking security in respect of substantially all of the Issuer’s property and
assets, which also secures the Class A Notes, including the Issuer’s rights
against each Obligor under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement, the Borrower Deed of Charge (including the security trusts
created thereunder), the Woburn Deed of Charge (including the security
trusts created thereunder), the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Cash
Management Agreement, the Issuer English Corporate Services
Agreement, the Issuer Jersey Corporate Services Agreement, the Issuer
Account Bank Agreement and the Agency Agreement and its rights in
respect of its bank accounts and “Eligible Investments”. In addition, the
Class B6 Notes will have the benefit of the Topco Security created under
the Topco Security Documents in favour of the Borrower Security
Trustee. For details of the security for the Class B6 Notes, see “Terms
_and Conditions of the Class B Notes — Condition 2.2 (Security).”_

**_Security for the Class B6 Loan: .............._** The Class B6 Loan will be secured on a subordinated basis by first
ranking security in respect of, among other things, all of the Obligors’
right, title and interest in its assets pursuant to the Borrower Deed of
Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge and have the benefit of security
interests created by the Topco Security Documents.

The Class B6 Loan will share security with, among others, the Class A
Loans, the Liquidity Facility and certain hedging arrangements; provided
that the Class B6 Loan ranks junior to the foregoing with respect to the
application of enforcement proceeds, other than in respect of the Topco
Security.

The shared security package includes first ranking mortgages or fixed
charges of, among other things, the freehold and leasehold interests in the
properties which are owned by the Obligors and fixed or floating charges
over all other property, undertakings and assets of each Obligor. In
addition, each Obligor has granted a first-ranking legal mortgage over the
shares it owns in any English Obligor. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements — Borrower Security Documents — Borrower_
_Deed of Charge” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements_
_— Borrower Security Documents — Woburn Deed of Charge”._

the Class B Loans; and (c) all other amounts outstanding under the Class
B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (the “Topco **Payment**

Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited together with a floating charge over all of CP
Cayman Limited’s other assets pursuant to a security agreement entered
into on the Fourth Closing Date (the “CP Cayman Security
**Agreement”). The security interests created under the Topco Share**
Security Agreement, the CP Cayman Security Agreement and the other
Topco Security Documents constitutes the “Topco Security”. The
Class A Notes and the Class A Loans do not have the benefit of the Topco
Payment Undertaking and the security interests created under the Topco
Security Documents.

Further details in respect of these agreements are set out in “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement”,_
_“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Topco Share_
_Security Agreement” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements — CP Cayman Security Agreement”._

**_Optional and mandatory redemption of the The Class B6 Notes will be pass-through notes and will be subject to_**
**_Class B6 Notes: ........................................_** mandatory redemption prior to the Class B6 Note Final Maturity Date if

and to the extent that the Borrowers make principal repayments or
prepayments to the Issuer in respect of the Class B6 Loan, either at the
option of the Borrowers or following any enforcement of the Topco Share
Security or the Transaction Security.

Any such redemption of the Class B6 Notes will be on the same terms
and at the same prices (including any applicable premium) as for the
prepayment of the Class B6 Loan.

It is expected that, because of the terms of the Topco Payment
Undertaking and the Topco Security Documents, the Borrowers will elect
to prepay the Class B6 Loan on or before the Class B6 Loan Expected
Maturity Date, but they are not obliged to do so and the Issuer is therefore
not obliged to redeem the Class B6 Notes on the Class B6 Note Expected
Maturity Date.

At any time on or after 28 August 2023, the Class B6 Loans will be
prepayable at the option of the Borrowers, in whole or in part, at the
purchase prices set out in “Description of the Class B6 Loan—
_Prepayment — Optional Prepayment”._

At any time prior to 28 August 2023, the Borrowers may prepay some or
all of the Class B6 Loans at a prepayment price equal to 100% of their
principal amount outstanding plus (i) accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, and (ii) a make-whole premium as specified
in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

Prior to 28 August 2023, the Borrowers may prepay up to 10% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the Class B6 Loan in each
calendar year at a prepayment price equal to 103% of the principal
amount of the Class B6 Loan prepaid.

**_Mandatory offers to Purchase for Class B_**
**_Change of Control and Asset Sales: ........_**


In addition, prior to 28 August 2023, the Borrowers may on one or more
occasions use the net proceeds of specified equity offerings to prepay up
to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Class B6 Loan, at a
purchase price equal to    % of the aggregate principal amount of the
Class B6 Loan, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts,
if any, up to the prepayment date, provided that at least 50% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the Class B6 Loan in issue remains
outstanding after the prepayment.

The funds received by the Issuer from the prepayment of the Class B6
Loan will be used by the Issuer to redeem a corresponding principal
amount of outstanding Class B6 Notes in accordance with the Class B
Conditions. See “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes — Condition
_5 (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation)”._

The terms of the asset sales covenant in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement require the Borrowers to use certain of the proceeds of certain
asset sales to either invest in additional assets or repay certain other
indebtedness, and if they do not, to use such excess proceeds since such
asset sale to make an offer to repurchase the Class B Notes at a repurchase
price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amount, if any, any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
purchase.

Following a Class B Change of Control (as defined in the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) with respect to the Class B6 Notes,
the Borrowers will be required to offer to repurchase all or any part of the
Class B6 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Class B6 Loan Deferred
Interest Amount, if any, any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. See “Description of
_the Class B6 Loan”._


**_Tender Offers: .........................................._** In connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset

Sale Offer for the Class B6 Notes, if not less than 90 per cent. in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Class B6 Notes are validly
tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and purchased pursuant to such
offer by a Borrower, the Borrowers may prepay the remaining principal
amount of the Class B6 Loan, in whole but not in part, at a price equal to
the purchase price offered to holders of the Class B6 Notes pursuant to
such offer (which may be less than par) and the Issuer will be required to
apply the proceeds received from such prepayment to redeem a
corresponding principal amount of Class B6 Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, at a
redemption price corresponding to the prepayment price. See
“Description _of_ _the_ _Class_ _B6_ _Loan—_ _Prepayment—Optional_
_Prepayment”._


**_Early redemption for tax and other_**
**_reasons: ...................................................._**


The Class B6 Notes and the Class B6 Loan may be redeemed or repaid
at the option of the Issuer, in whole but not in part, at any time following
certain changes in tax laws and/or other laws at a price equal to 100% of
their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest
amounts, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, and
additional amounts if any, provided certain conditions are satisfied,
including that the Issuer has sufficient funds to make such redemption or
repayment. See “Description of the Class B6 Loan— Taxes — Repayment

_for Tax Reasons” and “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes —_
_Condition 5 (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation)”._

**_Class B6 Loan Financial Covenant: ......._** Prior to the repayment or satisfaction and discharge in full of the Class

B4 Loan, under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the
Obligors are required to maintain a ratio (expressed as a percentage) of
free cash flow to total debt service charges (the “Class B FCF DSCR”)
equal to at least 100% on each Financial Covenant Test Date.

The Obligors will have the benefit of certain cure rights in the event that
the Class B FCF DSCR is less than 100%. On 29 July 2020, the Obligors
obtained the requisite Class B Noteholder consent to suspend the
requirement to comply with the Class B FCF DSCR financial covenant
on the financial covenant test dates falling in August 2020, February 2021
and August 2021 and to adjust the basis on which this covenant is
calculated for the purposes of the financial covenant test date falling in
February 2022.

The Class B FCF DSCR financial covenant in the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement shall no longer be required to be
complied with following the repayment or satisfaction and discharge in
full of the Class B4 Notes. See “Description of the Class B6 Loan”.

For the purposes of any amendment, consent, waiver, modification,
variation or supplement in respect of the Class B FCF DSCR financial
covenant in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the relevant
Class B Noteholders shall be the Class B4 Noteholders. See “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements —Instructing Group.”_

**_Certain other Class B6 Loan covenants:_** The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement limits, among other

things, Topco and the Obligors with respect to:

                    - the incurrence or guarantee of additional indebtedness;

                    - the payment of dividends or other distributions on, and the
redemption or repurchase of, its equity;

                    - the making of certain restricted payments and investments;

                    - the incurrence of certain liens;

                    - the imposition of restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay
dividends and other payments to members of the Group;

                    - the transfer, lease, sale or other disposition of certain assets;

                    - the merger, consolidation with, or sale of substantially all of the
Group’s assets to, other entities;

                    - the entry into certain transactions with affiliates; and

                    - the impairment of the security interest for the holders of Class B
Notes.

Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and
qualifications. See “Description of the Class B6 Loan”.

**_Events of Default: ...................................._** No Class B Note Event of Default or Class B Loan Event of Default may

occur with respect to the Class B Notes or any Class B Loans while the
Class A Notes or Class A Loans are outstanding (until after an
acceleration of the Class A Notes or Class A Loans, respectively).
However the Class B Noteholders have the ability to demand repayment
by Topco pursuant to the Topco Payment Undertaking and direct the

23


-----

Borrower Security Trustee to enforce the security granted pursuant to the
Topco Security Documents upon the occurrence of any Share
Enforcement Event.

**_Share Enforcement Event: ......................_** Each of the following will constitute a Share Enforcement Event under

the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, among others:

                    - any default in the payment of interest or additional amounts, if any,
on a Class B Loan (subject to a 30-day grace period);

                    - any amount remaining outstanding under a Class B Loan at the close
of business on the Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date of such
Class B Loan;

                    - any failure to pay principal or premium on a Class B Loan upon any
optional redemption, required repurchase or declaration;

                    - any failure to comply with the covenant described under the headings
“Description of the Class B6 Loan—Class B Change of Control”
(other than a failure to purchase Class B Notes which will constitute
a Share Enforcement Event per the above) (subject to 30 day grace
period);

                    - any failure to comply with the covenant described under the heading
“Description of the Class B6 Loan— Certain Covenants —
_Limitation on Holding Company Activities”;_

                    - any failure to comply with certain other covenants under Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (subject to a 60-day grace period);

                    - default under any indebtedness that results from a failure to pay
principal when due or results in acceleration of such indebtedness
(subject to a £25.0 million threshold);

                    - certain bankruptcy events of default;

                    - certain judgment defaults (subject to a £25.0 million threshold and
60-day grace period);

                    - any impairment of the security interest granted in respect of material
collateral (subject to a 10-business day grace period); and

                    - any impairment of a guarantee.

If a Share Enforcement Event occurs and is continuing, the Borrower
Security Trustee acting upon instructions of the Issuer Security Trustee
as directed by the Class B Note Trustee, who shall be required to act if
directed by the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Class B Notes, will be able to enforce the Topco Security,
subject to certain requirements being met. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements —Intercreditor” and “Description of the Class_
_B6 Loan — Share Enforcement Event” and “Risk Factors – Risks_
_Relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency - The Borrower_
_Security Trustee will only enforce the Borrower Security if it is instructed_
_to do so by the requisite percentage of Class A Noteholders or Class B_
_Noteholders, as the case may be.”_

If at any time either (i) no amounts remain outstanding under any Class A
Notes or (ii) an acceleration of the amounts outstanding under any
Class A Loans has occurred, each of the Share Enforcement Events
specified above will also constitute a Class B Loan Event of Default.

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL FINANCIAL AND OPERATING INFORMATION**

_The following tables present summary historical consolidated financial information of Center Parcs_
_(Holdings 1) Limited for the periods indicated. This summary historical financial information is based on (i) the_
_audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited as at and for each_
_of the 52-week periods ended 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 and the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, in each_
_case included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, and (ii) the Interim Financial Information incorporated by_
_reference into this Offering Memorandum, except as noted below. The audit reports, included elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum, express an unqualified opinion for each of the respective audited periods and the audit report_
_in relation to the financial statements as at and for the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020 includes a material_
_uncertainty paragraph related to going concern as set forth in Note 1 to such financial statements. The financial_
_information as at 26 April 2018 has been derived from the comparative period included in the audited consolidated_
_financial statements as at and for the 52-week periods ended 25 April 2019._ _The Interim Financial Information as at_
_and for the 36-week periods ended 31 December 2020 and 2 January 2020 has not been prepared in accordance with_
_IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and has not been audited or reviewed. The following summary historical_
_consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with “Selected Consolidated Financial_
_Information,” “Presentation of Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations”, as well as the consolidated financial statements and related notes of Center_
_Parcs included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited early adopted IFRS 16 in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and_
_recognised £2.2 million as a reduction in retained earnings as a result of the adoption. Center Parcs (Holdings 1)_
_Limited early adopted IFRS 16 by applying the modified retrospective approach, which requires the cumulative effect_
_of the initial application of IFRS 16 to be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on_
_27 April 2018, the date of initial application, without restating prior periods. On adoption, right of use assets and_
_lease liabilities were brought onto the balance sheet for £30.9 million and £33.1 million, respectively, and related_
_depreciation charges and finance expense are recognised in the income statement, instead of operating lease rentals_
_expenses._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 15 in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 using_
_the retrospective method and restating the comparative periods. The effect of adoption of IFRS 15 as at 20 April 2017_
_was the deferral of £0.8 million of revenue in respect of certain promotional activities that was recognised as a liability_
_at the transition date with a corresponding reduction to retained earnings._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 9 in the 52 weeks period ended 25 April 2019 and in_
_accordance with the standard, the comparative periods were not restated. The adoption of IFRS 9 on 27 April 2018_
_did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited._

_As a result of the adoption of the above accounting standards and the additional week included in the 53-_
_week period ended 26 April 2018, the audited consolidated financial statements as at and for each of the 52-week_
_periods ended 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 are not directly comparable with the audited consolidated financial_
_statements as at and for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, included in this Offering Memorandum. The audited_
_consolidated financial statements as at and for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018 were prepared in accordance_
_with IAS 18, Revenue, IAS 17, Leases and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, which were_
_the standards applicable at that time._

_During the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020, the Center Parcs villages were closed from 20 March 2020_
_to the end of the period and in the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020, all five of the Center Parcs villages were_
_closed from 24 April 2020 to 13 July 2020, 5 November 2020 to 4 December 2020 and 21 December 2020 to 31_
_December 2020 and only open with capacity restrictions for the remaining periods and were also subject to localised_
_closures as a result of the tier restrictions, such as the closure of Sherwood Village from 30 October 2020 and the_
_closure of Woburn Village from 18 December 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to facilitate_
_comparability to the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, certain_
_financial and operational information is presented as of and for the 52-week period from 1 March 2019 to 27 February_
_2020, which represents the last 52-week period for which management accounts are available and during which all_
_villages were open and operational. Figures for the 52 week period from 1 March 2019 to 27 February 2020 are_
_calculated by adding together the results from the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 to the results from 26 April_
_2019 to 27 February 2020 and deducting the results from 27 April 2018 to 28 February 2019. In addition, certain_
_comparative figures are also presented as of and for the 52-week period from 2 March 2018 to 28 February 2019._

-----

_These comparative figures are calculated by adding together the results from the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018_
_to the results from 27 April 2018 to 28 February 2019 and deducting the results from 21 April 2017 to 22 February_
_2018 and the 53-week Adjustment. The financial information for the 52-week periods ended 27 February 2020 and 28_
_February 2019 has been extracted from management accounts._ _The financial information for the 52-week periods_
_ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019 has been prepared in accordance with IFRS with the exception of_
_certain year-end procedures that were not performed in preparing the financial information for the 52-week periods_
_ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019, and as such they may not represent the same financial information_
_that would have resulted if Center Parcs had produced year-end financial statements for the 52-week periods ended_
_27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019, respectively. The financial information for the 52-week periods ended 27_
_February 2020 and 28 February 2019 has not been audited or reviewed. See “Presentation of Financial Information.”_

_The summary historical consolidated financial information and the “as adjusted” financial information_
_included below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum is not necessarily indicative of, and does not constitute_
_projections for, the financial results for the Center Parcs Group for any future period. The “as adjusted” financial_
_information is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realised_
_had the Transactions occurred on the dates indicated._

(2) Exceptional and non-underlying items represented exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses of £2.2 million for the
financial year ended 23 April 2020, comprised of £2.0 million in costs to exit a contract and £0.2 million of legal and other associated
costs relating to the equity contribution provided by the Brookfield Funds. Exceptional and non-underlying items for the financial year

ended 26 April 2018 represented exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses of £1.6 million of costs relating to legal health
and safety claims at Woburn Forest and associated settlements, together with £0.7 million of one-off restructuring and reorganisation
costs.

(3) Exceptional and non-underlying finance expense for the 36 weeks ended 31 December 2020 represents fees incurred to obtain a waiver
of the covenants on the Group’s secured debt. Exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses for the financial year ended 25 April
2019 represented the £6.1 million premium paid on the settlement of Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes and £1.6 million in accelerated
amortization of deferred issue costs in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes. Exceptional and non-underlying
finance expenses for the financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented the £26.9 million premium paid on the settlement of Center
Parcs’ Class B2 Notes.

(4) Exceptional and non-underlying taxation expense for the financial year ended 23 April 2020 represented the impact of the change in the
applicable deferred tax rate from 17% to 19%, which was partially offset by a taxation credit related to exceptional and non-underlying
administrative expenses. Exceptional and non-underlying taxation income for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 represented a
£1.5 million tax credit related to break costs and the accelerated write-off of deferred fees in connection with the redemption of Center
Parcs’ Class A3 Notes. Exceptional and non-underlying taxation income for the financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented a
£5.3 million tax credit in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class B3 Notes and a £1.9 million tax credit in respect of a
one-off adjustment to group relief relating to restricted interest deductions and subsequent increased capital allowances claims.

(a) Center Parcs early adopted IFRS 16 in the 52 weeks period ended 25 April 2019, so EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the 52-week
periods ended 25 April 2019 and 23 April 2020 may not be directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53-week
period ended 26 April 2018. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Key
_Factors Affecting Results of Operations—IFRS 16” and “Presentation of Financial Information.”_

(b) Center Parcs does not calculate taxation for interim periods.

(c) Center Parcs defines EBITDA as profit/(loss) for the period attributable to equity shareholders before interest, taxation, depreciation
and amortisation. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA as defined above, further adjusted to remove the effects of certain
exceptional and non-underlying items that Center Parcs believes are not indicative of its underlying operating performance. EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures under IFRS and investors should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as alternatives
to (a) operating profit or profit/(loss) for the period as a measure of Center Parcs’ operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating,
investing and financing activities as a measure of Center Parcs’ ability to meet its cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance
under IFRS. Investors should evaluate each adjustment and the reasons Center Parcs considers it appropriate as a method of supplemental
analysis. In evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that, as an analytical tool, EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA are each subject to certain limitations. See “Presentation of Financial Information — Non-IFRS Financial Measures”. In
addition, investors should be aware that Center Parcs is likely to incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation in the
future and that certain of these items could be considered recurring in nature. Center Parcs’ presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should
not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. For further information, see
the discussions on exceptional items in Center Parcs’ financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

(d) Exceptional and non-underlying items represented exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses of £2.2 million for the
financial year ended 23 April 2020, comprised of £2.0 million in costs to exit a contract and £0.2 million of legal and other associated

34

costs relating to the equity contribution provided by the Brookfield Funds. Exceptional and non-underlying items for the financial year
ended 26 April 2018 represented exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses of £1.6 million of costs relating to legal health
and safety claims at Woburn Forest and associated settlements, together with £0.7 million of one-off restructuring and reorganisation
costs.

(1) Center Parcs adopted IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ starting on 27 April 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Center Parcs recognises a
right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term
leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, Center Parcs recognises
the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

_many of the other risks described in this section. This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements_
_that involve risks and uncertainties. The Center Parcs Group’s actual results could differ materially from those_
_anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by the Center_
_Parcs Group described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**RISKS RELATING TO CENTER PARCS’ BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY**

**_The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect Center Parcs’ business,_**
**_financial condition and results of operations._**

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected and is expected to continue to significantly affect the
travel and hospitality industry in the United Kingdom for a significant but undetermined period of time. The current
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as its uncertain future impact, including its effect on the ability or desire
of people to travel and to stay at holiday villages, may negatively affect Center Parcs’ results, operations, outlook,
plans, growth, cash flows and liquidity.

Center Parcs has been and expects to continue to be adversely impacted by governmental efforts to contain
the COVID-19 pandemic, including stay-at-home measures and social distancing requirements. Due to COVID-19
restrictions, Center Parcs’ villages were closed for prolonged periods in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, with all
villages closed during the national lockdowns and Closure Periods. Center Parcs recorded no revenue during the
periods when all villages were closed. During the periods the villages were open to guests, they operated with limited
capacity and were also subject to localised closures as a result of the tier restrictions, such as the closure of Sherwood
Village from 30 October 2020 and the closure of Woburn Village from 18 December 2020, in both cases until the 12
April 2021 reopening. As a result, Center Parcs’ revenue was adversely impacted, with revenue of £114.9 million in
the 36 weeks ended 31 December 2020 as compared to £360.2 million in the 36 weeks ended 2 January 2020. In
addition, approximately half of Center Parcs’ guests with bookings for these Closure Periods requested refunds from
Center Parcs instead of choosing to postpone their holidays. These refunds had a negative impact on Center Parcs’
cash flows. Center Parcs expects additional health and safety regulations that the UK government has enacted or may
enact in the future in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to affect Center Parcs’ holiday villages, subject
to the government’s review of the health and safety measures expected to remain in place after 21 June 2021. Such
regulations, particularly those resulting in closure of the villages or limitations on occupancy levels, are expected to
increase Center Parcs’ operating costs and compliance burden.While Center Parcs believes it is in compliance with
current regulations, future regulations and guidelines may be more onerous and there can be no assurance that such
regulations and guidelines will not further restrict Center Parcs’ ability to operate its villages.

Center Parcs has implemented significant operational changes in accordance with government health and
safety regulations. Since the initial reopening after the first wave of COVID-19 on 13 July 2020, for all periods when
the villages have been open, Center Parcs’ villages have been operating at reduced capacity levels appropriate to
ensure proper application of government requirements and Center Parcs has implemented enhanced health and safety
measures such as hand sanitisation stations, deep cleaning of accommodation between departing and arriving guests
and increased cleaning and disinfection of public areas. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the sub-tropical
swimming paradise is closed, and many indoor activities are suspended. Center Parcs’ hotel rooms and apartments are
also currently not available for use, and the food and beverage offerings at our villages are limited to takeaways and
self-catering with some outdoor beverage service available on terraces. Center Parcs is currently limiting occupancy
to 75%, and plans to increase its occupancy levels to near-full occupancy at the end of summer 2021. Center Parcs
continues to review and amend its operating procedures, prioritising guest and employee safety. These operational
changes are likely to result in a decrease in revenue, due to the reduction in capacity, as well additional operating
expenses.

-----

A localised outbreak among guests or employees at any of Center Parcs’ villages could lead to a further
period of closure for the affected village and in other regulatory intervention. Such an outbreak could adversely affect
Center Parcs’ reputation or affect guests’ willingness to book future holidays. An outbreak at any of its villages could
also give rise to legal claims from employees and guests in connection with the adequacy of Center Parcs’ response
to COVID-19. In addition, any outbreak in the UK could increase cancellations and affect guest demand for holidays.
Local governments in the UK may also exercise their power to contain the spread of COVID-19 by preventing travel
into and out of localities and shutting down venues such as Center Parcs’ villages. Such restrictions may prevent guests
from travelling to Center Parcs even when the villages are open and result in further cancellations.

In addition, as a result of existing social distancing requirements, as well as future regulations that may be
promulgated to contain COVID-19, Center Parcs cannot be certain when it will be able to fully reopen all facilities
and amenities at its holiday villages, and what public health and safety requirements it will be required to implement
in the future. Despite the government’s currently announced intention to lift all restrictions no sooner than 21 June
2021, subject to various conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and it is not clear how long
government restrictions and social distancing measures will last, or whether tighter restrictions will be reintroduced
resulting in one or more villages having to close again. The ability of Center Parcs’ business is dependent on the lifting
of COVID-19 restrictions by the government. In particular, the government has put in place four tests for evaluating
whether COVID-19 restrictions should be lifted: (i) the vaccine deployment programme continues successfully, (ii)
evidence shows vaccines are sufficiently effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths in those vaccinated, (iii)
infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS and (iv) the
government’s assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of concern. The failure of any of
these tests may delay or prevent the lifting of government restrictions. Furthermore, there also exists the risk that the
emergence of new variants of COVID-19, disruptions to vaccine supplies or the resurgence of the seasonal flu could
lead to further government restrictions being imposed. It is therefore not certain how quickly operations will return to
pre-crisis levels, if at all. Such developments and regulations could adversely impact Center Parcs’ ability to operate
at full capacity and to offer all of the services, facilities and amenities guests typically expect at Center Parcs’ holiday
villages. Current and any future restrictions on facilities and amenities may have a negative impact on customer
experience and satisfaction. In addition, customers may either cancel their bookings or seek discounted pricing for
Center Parcs’ offerings as a result of the limitations on availability of certain facilities and amenities, which could
adversely affect Center Parcs’ revenues and cash flow. As long as such facilities and amenities remain closed, there
is a risk that Center Parcs may be required to refund guests that wish to cancel their bookings.

As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, in accordance with its terms and conditions, Center Parcs has
in place a Book with Confidence Guarantee, giving all guests with an arrival date up to 21 June 2021 the option to
reschedule or cancel with a full refund six weeks before arrival. Guests arriving between 21 June 2021 and 18 April
2022 have the option to reschedule or cancel with a full refund eleven weeks before arrival. There is a risk that this
policy may materially and adversely impact Center Parcs’ revenue and occupancy rates if significant numbers of its
guests choose to cancel or move their bookings on short notice. In particular, given the current state of uncertainty
with regards to overseas travel, there is a risk that some of Center Parcs’ guests may book holidays in Center Parcs’
villages, which they may then cancel on short notice if overseas travel is permitted.

The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic restricts Center Parcs’ ability to make accurate
financial and operational forecasts. Center Parcs had never previously closed all five villages and ceased all nonessential operating expenses before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. As a result, Center Parcs has limited
ability to be predictive of the near-term and medium-term impact of COVID-19 on occupancy, RevPAL, guest
expenditures and operating costs. Despite the ongoing vaccination programme in the United Kingdom, there remains
material uncertainty about any future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of variants with limited
susceptibility to vaccines, the success of the vaccination programme, or otherwise. As a result of such uncertainties,
Center Parcs’ past performance should not be considered an indication of its future performance. In addition, the
COVID-19 disruption and operating restrictions imposed in the periods after village re-openings inevitably impacts
the ability to meaningfully compare year over year and period over period key performance metrics such as
Occupancy, ADR, RevPal etc. This will likely continue until there is the benefit of unrestricted trading in both periods
being compared.

The closure of Center Parcs’ villages and expected staged reopening process due to COVID-19 has adversely
impacted Center Parcs’ ability to generate sufficient cash flows and liquidity position. As a result, since April 2020,
the Brookfield Funds have provided equity contributions of £120.0 million, comprising £41.5 million received in April
2020, £27.5 million received in May 2020 and £51.0 million received in February 2021, and the Intercompany

40


-----

Account Advance of £70 million received on 14 July 2020 to support Center Parcs. These commitments are part of a
total of £230 million of financial support available to Center Parcs that has been approved by the Brookfield funds,
with the balance of £40 million available to Center Parcs and CP Ireland if required. If Center Parcs cannot generate
sufficient cash flow in the future due to the effects of COVID-19, or for other reasons, then Center Parcs may be
reliant on Brookfield to contribute additional capital to support the business and allow it to meet its operating expenses
and debt payments. If Brookfield declines to or is unable to provide such additional capital contributions, Center Parcs
may not be able to meet its required expenditures, including operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt
payments.

In accordance with the UK government’s CJRS, Center Parcs furloughed approximately 90% of its
employees from 27 March 2020 until 3 July 2020.As Center Parcs’ villages were closed again due to the re-imposition
of COVID-19 restrictions (such as the closure of Sherwood Village on 30 October 2020, the closure of Woburn Village
on 18 December 2020 and the remaining villages from 5 November 2020 to 4 December 2020 and on 21 December
2020), approximately 90% of employees at each village were furloughed as they were closed. Currently, after the reopening of Center Parcs’ villages on 12 April 2021, only a small number of Center Parcs’ employees remain on
furlough. There is a risk that some of Center Parcs employees may not return following the end of the furlough period
or the end of the CJRS. If future closure of Center Parcs’ villages were to be required due to COVID-19, government
regulations or otherwise, or if the CJRS were unavailable to Center Parcs, or if Center Parcs’ business otherwise
deteriorates, Center Parcs cannot assure that it would be able to retain all of its employees. Further, if schools are
closed again in response to COVID-19 or otherwise, employee absentee rates may increase due to employees who are
parents not being able to find suitable childcare options to allow them to continue or return to their previous
employment activities. Higher absence rates could result in increased payroll costs for Center Parcs. In addition, higher
employee absence rates and lower employee retention could impact adversely affect customer experience as well as
employee satisfaction. See “—Center Parcs’ business could be harmed if it loses the services of its key management
_personnel or is unable to attract and retain qualified employees.”_

If the UK government agrees to provide further crisis relief assistance that Center Parcs’ accepts in response
to prolonged or additional COVID-19 outbreaks, it may impose certain requirements on the recipients of the aid,
including restrictions on executive officer compensation, dividends, prepayment of debt, limitations on debt and other
similar restrictions that would apply for a period of time after the aid is repaid or redeemed in full. These requirements
or restrictions may further restrict Center Parcs’ ability to operate its business or restrict access to additional financing.

The revenue loss resulting from the closure of Center Parcs’ villages due to the COVID-19 pandemic was
not covered by Center Parcs’ insurance. As a result, Center Parcs’ will not be able to recoup lost revenue due to the
closure of its villages during the Closure Periods, and may not be covered for any future closures resulting from new
government guidance or a new outbreak of COVID-19. See “—Center Parcs’ insurance coverage may not be
_adequate to cover all possible losses that it could suffer, and its insurance costs may increase.”_

Center Parcs’ business is sensitive to economic downturns and the corresponding impact on discretionary
consumer spending. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental measures to contain it have adversely affected UK
economic activity, including consumer spending and travel demand. UK gross domestic product decreased by 2.2%
between January and March 2020 and decreased by a further 20.4% between April and June 2020, as the UK economy
entered into a recession. Gross domestic product subsequently grew for the next two quarters, with a 16.1% and 1.0%
increase from July to September 2020 and October to December 2020 respectively. However, as compared to gross
domestic product from October to December 2019, gross domestic product from October to December 2020 had
decreased by 7.8%. Over the calendar year 2020 as a whole, the UK’s gross domestic product contracted by 9.9%.
There is a risk that the UK economy may take multiple years to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Any actual or
perceived deterioration or weakness in economic conditions, consumer debt levels or consumer confidence, due to
COVID-19 or otherwise, may lead to Center Parcs’ customers having less discretionary income to spend on recreation
activities and discretionary travel.

There is material uncertainty about the short-term and long-term effects of the COVID-19 crisis on travel
demand. Actual or perceived risks of infection could cause travel demand, including demand for a holiday village
experience, to remain weak for a significant length of time. The COVID-19 pandemic may also alter customer
expectations and preferences in other ways, including guest expectations related to health and safety measures at
holiday villages. The form, extent and duration of such impacts remain largely uncertain.

Although Fitch affirmed the Issuer’s credit rating on 18 June 2020 and S&P affirmed the BBB credit rating
of the Issuer’s Class A Notes on 16 July 2020, the credit rating of the Issuer’s Class B Notes was downgraded to B
41


-----

on 16 July 2020 by S&P. If the Issuer’s credit ratings were to be further downgraded, or general market conditions
were to ascribe higher risk to the Issuer’s rating levels, the hospitality industry, or Center Parcs itself, the Issuer’s (and
therefore Center Parcs’) access to capital and the cost of any debt financing would be further negatively impacted. See
“—Ratings Agency assessments, downgrades and changes to Rating Agencies’ criteria may result in ratings volatility
_on the Offered Notes.”_ In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants,
which may further restrict Center Parcs’ ability to operate its business or restrict access to additional financing due to
its covenant restrictions then in effect. There is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund
Center Parcs’ obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with Center Parcs’ expectations.
Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 on the financial markets, including the debt capital markets, could adversely
impact Center Parcs’ ability to raise funds through financings.

The effect of the global COVID-19 pandemic on Center Parcs’ business and the wider hospitality industry
will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak,
the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing outbreaks and decreasing hospitalisation and death rates, the prevalence of
further variants which may be more virulent, more infectious or less responsive to vaccines, and the length of time it
takes for demand and pricing to return and for normal economic and operating conditions to resume. There are no
comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and, as a
result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is uncertain and subject to change. Even after the current outbreak of
COVID-19 subsides, Center Parcs could still experience long-term impacts on operating costs as a result of attempts
to counteract future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other epidemics, including for example enhanced health and safety
requirements or other measures. If a future outbreak of COVID-19 were to occur, the impact to Center Parcs is
uncertain and unpredictable. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and may in the future have, a material
adverse effect on Center Parcs’ financial condition, results of operations and business.

**_As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is material uncertainty about Center Parcs’ ability to_**
**_continue as a going concern._**

Center Parcs’ 2020 Audited Financial Statements were prepared on a going concern basis. The going concern
basis contemplates realisation of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and does
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty regarding Center Parcs’ ability to
continue as such. However, given that the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, there exists a material uncertainty
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt about Center Parcs’ ability to continue as a going
concern.

Despite the liquidity support provided by Brookfield thus far, uncertainty remains with regards forecasting
both the pace of recovery and the eventual levels to which trading will return and accordingly it is possible that further
funding may be required and Center Parcs may not be able to secure such additional funding. Depending on how
quickly Center Parcs’ trading recovers or if there are further government-imposed restrictions that result in the closure
of one or more villages for a period of time, there is a risk that existing financial covenants under the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will be breached. As at the date of
this Offering Memorandum, there remains a requirement to ensure various social distancing measures are in place and
certain activities are not as yet able to operate. As a result, this has had and is expected to continue to have a significant
impact on the format of guests breaks as well as on occupancy levels. These make it challenging for Center Parcs to
accurately forecast its cash flows.

If one or more of Center Parcs’ assumptions in making its assessment to report as a going concern are found
to be incorrect, Center Parcs may be unable to continue as a going concern. For additional detail, see Note 1 to the
2020 Audited Financial Statements and “Summary—Recent Developments—Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic.” If
Center Parcs is unable to continue as a going concern, it would have to liquidate its assets and may receive less than
the value at which those assets are carried on Center Parcs’ audited financial statements, and it is likely that investors
will lose a part or all of their investment in the Offered Notes.

**_Center Parcs derives its revenue from operating its villages. Any failure to manage its villages effectively or any_**
**_significant business interruption or other event affecting the operation of one or more of its villages may have a_**
**_material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Center Parcs operates five holiday villages in England. Any significant business interruption at any of its
villages, such as the closure of all five holiday villages from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020, 5 November 2020 to 4
December 2020 and 21 December 2020 to 12 April 2021 as well as localised closures as a result of the tier restrictions,

42


-----

such as the closure of Sherwood Village from 30 October 2020 and the closure of Woburn Village from 18 December
2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ financial condition
and results of operations. Although Center Parcs has risk management arrangements, including business continuity
plans, in place, such risk management arrangements, or any insurance may not adequately protect Center Parcs from
significant interruption of business at any one or more of the villages. In addition, Center Parcs may not be able to
obtain planning permission or planning consent to rebuild properties if destroyed, regardless of the availability of
insurance proceeds. A significant interruption or event could be created by any number of internal or external factors,
including fire (as occurred at the Elveden village in 2002, resulting in a 15-month closure), extreme weather
conditions, accidents, loss of utilities or other interruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—The COVID-19
_pandemic has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect Center Parcs’ business, financial condition_
_and results of operations.” Due to the full service, self-contained nature of its villages, Center Parcs maintains_
significant infrastructure, including water supply, electricity and waste water treatment, and any failure to adequately
develop and maintain these facilities could also result in a significant business interruption. Such interruptions and
events may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely
affected by a number of factors relating to the operation of any village or the guest perception or expectation of the
operating activities in a particular village. Factors that relate specifically to a particular village could include, amongst
others:

    - the age, design, construction quality and maintenance of the village;

    - perceptions regarding the attractiveness of the village;

    - the proximity and attractiveness of competing UK holiday centres;

    - the proximity of other developments and infrastructure projects, for example, power stations or road
projects, which adversely impacts guest experiences;

    - increases in operating expenses;

    - inability to pass on to guests any significant unforeseen input costs, such as utility costs, that would
erode Center Parcs’ margins;

    - an increase in the capital expenditure needed to maintain the village or make improvements, or to
maintain the competitiveness of the villages;

    - an outbreak of COVID-19 or a notifiable illness, food poisoning or drinking water contamination at
any village;

    - major village damage or disruption including natural or environmental disasters;

    - bad or extreme weather conditions;

    - an illness, disease or event that damages the forest, fauna and natural environment surrounding a
village;

    - guest health and safety issues, such as inadequate or untimely first aid responses, accidents, personal
injuries or child abuse or abduction;

    - burglaries or thefts of personal belongings from village accommodation or facilities;

    - a fluctuation or decline, seasonal or otherwise, in demand for the facilities that the village offers;

    - increases in development and construction costs or delays in completion schedules;

    - disturbances to guests’ experiences caused by new build, maintenance or refurbishment projects;
and

    - negative publicity or guest perceptions about any village due to the above-mentioned factors or
otherwise.

Center Parcs’ effective management and operation of the villages has a significant impact on the revenues,
expenses and value of the villages. Any failure to manage Center Parcs’ operations effectively, including any failure

to anticipate and react to the above-mentioned factors may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Governmental regulation may adversely affect Center Parcs’ existing and future operations and results._**

Center Parcs is subject to various national and local regulations that have affected, and will continue to affect,
its operations. Each of its holiday villages is subject to national and local licensing and regulation by health, sanitation,
food and workplace safety, and other agencies. Center Parcs has been and expects to continue to be adversely impacted
by governmental efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, including stay-at-home measures and social distancing
requirements. Further, there is a material risk that the UK government may in the future require the closure of Center
Parcs’ villages or impose further restrictions on travel and distancing in order to manage the spread of COVID-19,
including any new variants. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and may continue to negatively
_affect Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.”_ Its operations are also subject to
regulations which govern such matters as the minimum wage, national living wage, overtime and other working
conditions, along with parental leave and a variety of similar laws enacted to govern these and other employment law
matters.

The UK government introduced a national living wage in the 2015 budget, which has applied to employees
aged 25 and over since April 2016, and includes further phased increases in April of every year. Center Parcs extended
a similar wage increase to employees under the age of 25 as well. This increase in wages resulted in higher personnel
costs and is expected to result in further increase in personnel costs going forward. Changes to such laws and
regulations, including further increases to the minimum wage or national living wage, could have a materially adverse
impact on Center Parcs’ existing and future operations and results.

Center Parcs is also subject to the Equality Act 2010, which gives civil rights protections to individuals with
disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodation and other areas. Center Parcs may in the future have
to modify its villages to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. The expenses
associated with these modifications could be material. Regulations and laws, or the way in which they are interpreted,
may become more stringent over time, which could require new capital expenditures and result in an increase in its
operating costs.

**_Center Parcs’ business depends on the public perception of its brand. Any event at any village negatively affecting_**
**_guest perception or expectation will likely negatively affect guest perception of the other Center Parcs villages._**

The success of Center Parcs’ business depends on the public perception of the Center Parcs brand. Any event
or occurrence at any one village that negatively affects guest perceptions is likely to negatively affect guest perceptions
of the other Center Parcs villages. Center Parcs villages feature activities such as water activities, paintballing, laser
combat, horse riding, abseiling, zip wiring and quadbiking that pose a potential risk of accident and serious personal
injury. If a serious personal injury or an outbreak of COVID-19 were to occur at one of the holiday villages, attendance
at the holiday villages and, consequently, revenues might be materially adversely affected. In addition, holidays at
Center Parcs’ villages involve guest services and guest interactions, including with respect to bookings,
accommodation services, on-site activities and food and beverage provisions. A pattern of poor or unsatisfactory guest
service, guest complaints or poor reviews on social media at any of the villages could result in reputational harm to
the Center Parcs brand. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the
potential scope and speed of the negative publicity that could be generated by such incidents or events. Any accident,
interruption, serious disturbance or negative publicity at Center Parcs’ holiday villages, or a perception that the
facilities are unsafe or operate in an unsafe manner, may reduce attendance at or demand for its holiday villages, which
would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

Longford Forest in the Republic of Ireland opened in 2019. Although Longford Forest is outside of the
Obligor Group, any incidents at Longford Forest, such as an outbreak of COVID-19, poor reviews, or any future
incidents such as those described above, could have a negative impact on the perception of Center Parcs in general
and therefore on its results of operations.

If any such accidents or injuries do occur, Center Parcs’ insurance may not adequately cover the costs
stemming from such accidents and injuries or other disturbances and incidents. Center Parcs could also face legal
claims related to these events, as well as adverse publicity that could be generated by such incidents. Accidents or
injuries could also require upgrades, modifications or demolition of affected facilities, which could result in significant
costs to Center Parcs and disrupt operations, which could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,
financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, Center Parcs sells food and beverages, toys and other retail products, the sale of which involves
legal and other risks. As a reseller of food and retail merchandise, Center Parcs may be liable if the consumption or
purchase of any of the products it sells causes illness or injury. Furthermore, any product recall could result in losses
due to the cost of the recall, the destruction of product and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period
of time. A significant food, toy, gift or other retail product recall could also result in adverse publicity, damage to
Center Parcs’ reputation and loss of consumer confidence in its villages, which could have a material adverse effect
on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

Center Parcs targets affluent family-focused guests with historically approximately 80% of Center Parcs’
guests being families with children. In order to provide an environment that is attractive to this core group of guests,
Center Parcs strives to maintain a balanced guest profile of, amongst others, families, adult groups and corporate
events. If guests’ behaviour is disruptive or otherwise affects the enjoyment of other guests, this could result in adverse
publicity and damage to Center Parcs’ reputation. A failure to attract Center Parcs’ core demographic of affluent
guests with families could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial conditions and results
of operations.

**_Center Parcs’ business is currently located entirely in England. As a result, changes in the British holiday market,_**
**_including as a result of Brexit, may have a more significant adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations than on more geographically diverse holiday businesses._**

Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and its subsidiaries currently operate entirely in England. Accordingly,
Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations may be significantly adversely affected by a
number of factors, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK and the UK’s exit from the European
Union on 31 January 2020 (“Brexit”), that affect the UK holiday market, including:

    - national, regional or local economic conditions;

    - socioeconomic and demographic factors;

    - consumer confidence and personal disposable income;

    - exchange rate fluctuations or other factors which impact tourism or travel to or within the UK;

    - significant increases in utility and fuel costs;

    - local holiday market conditions from time to time (such as an over-supply or under-supply of
holiday resort accommodation and facilities);

    - consumer tastes and preferences;

    - changes in governmental regulations, fiscal policy, planning/zoning or tax laws and building codes
as well as other regulatory changes;

    - changes in minimum wage legislation or other factors increasing operational costs;

    - potential environmental legislation or liabilities or other legal liabilities;

    - acts of terrorism, natural disasters and direct political action; or

    - further instances of illness, epidemics or pandemics.

All Center Parcs’ villages are currently located in England and, consequently, the level of revenue and profit
generated by the villages could be substantially influenced by general economic conditions in the United Kingdom.
While Center Parcs’ revenues increased in each of financial years 2018 and 2019, Center Parcs’ revenues were lower
in financial year 2020 and the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 due to the closure of all five villages in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Center Parcs expects revenues may further decline in financial year 2021 due
to the Closure Periods and the more limited capacity offered during the periods when the villages were open. Center
Parcs cannot guarantee that revenue will return to growth in future periods or that any such growth will be sustained.
The villages have certain fixed operating costs, and as a result decreases in revenue may result in a significant decline
in net cash flow, as seen during the Closure Periods. In addition, a significant or sustained decline in economic
conditions or high rates of inflation, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or Brexit or uncertainty in the
period after the UK’s Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020 (the “Brexit Transition Period”), could adversely
affect Center Parcs’ ability to obtain goods and services from suppliers or credit from financing sources and could

45


-----

impact the ability of third parties, including insurance carriers and credit providers, to meet their obligations to Center
Parcs. Weak economic conditions generally in the United Kingdom, or in any regional market from which a particular
village attracts guests, may adversely affect holiday centre occupancy, guest spending patterns and Center Parcs’
general business and financial condition. Conversely, if general economic conditions in the United Kingdom were to
improve significantly, there may be greater consumer preference for holidays abroad.

The disposable income of Center Parcs’ guests and/or their holiday preferences may be affected by changes
in the general economic environment. Any decrease in disposable income of Center Parcs’ guests, such as that due to
the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in a decline in the number of guests and/or
a decrease in on-site spending. Even if economic conditions are stable or improving, a negative economic outlook,
including the fear of another recession, concerns about another wave of the COVID-19 pandemic or emergence of
new variants of COVID-19 and/or concerns regarding falling living standards, may adversely affect consumer
spending and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Political and economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit may be a source of instability in international markets,_**
**_create significant currency fluctuations, and adversely impact current trading and supply arrangements, which_**
**_could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, results of operations and financial condition._**

On 31 January 2020 at 11 p.m. (London time), the United Kingdom formally left the European Union and
entered the Brexit Transition Period, which expired on 31 December 2020 at 11 p.m. (London time). During the Brexit
Transition Period, the majority of rights and obligations associated with membership in the EU continued to apply to
the UK. On 24 December 2020, the EU and UK announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on future
relations between the EU and the UK following the end of the Brexit Transition Period (the “EU—UK Trade and
**Cooperation Agreement”). On 31 December 2020, the UK implemented the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation**
Agreement, which entered into force provisionally on 1 January 2021. The EU—UK Trade and Cooperation
Agreement has provisional application until the EU and the UK complete their ratification procedures. The consent
of the European Parliament is required before the Council of the European Union can conclude the EU—UK Trade
and Cooperation Agreement. At the request of the EU, the provisional application has been extended from 28 February
2021 to 30 April 2021 to allow time for legal-linguistic revision. Despite the implementation of the EU—UK Trade
and Cooperation Agreement, there remains significant uncertainty as to how Brexit will affect relations between the
UK and the EU, including the legal rights and obligations for businesses in certain services industries not covered by
the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not create a
detailed framework to govern the cross-border provision of regulated financial services from the UK into the EU and
from the EU into the UK. Such uncertainty could negatively impact business and consumer confidence in the UK,
which could lead to reduced levels of travel, and leisure travel in particular.

The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement)
Act 2020) and secondary legislation made under powers provided in this Act ensure that there is a functioning statute
book in the UK. While the UK introduced a temporary permission regime to allow EEA firms to continue to do
business in the UK for a limited period of time, once the passporting regime fell away, the majority of EEA states
have not introduced similar transitional regimes. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement is only part of the overall
package of agreements reached on 24 December 2020. Other supplementing agreements included a series of joint
declarations on a range of important issues where further cooperation is foreseen, including financial services. The
declarations state that the EU and the UK will discuss how to move forward with equivalence determinations in
relation to financial services. It should be noted that even if equivalence arrangements for certain sectors of the
financial services industry are agreed, market access is unlikely to be as comprehensive as the market access that the
UK enjoyed through its EU membership.

Due to the size and importance of the UK economy, and the uncertainty and unpredictability concerning the
United Kingdom’s legal, political and economic relationship with Europe after the end of the Brexit Transition Period,
there may continue to be instability in the market, significant currency fluctuations, and/or otherwise adverse effects
on trading agreements or similar cross-border cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal,
regulatory or otherwise) for the foreseeable future.

These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a
material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could
significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain
financial markets. In addition, Brexit may lead to or exacerbate a down-turn in the United Kingdom or other European

46


-----

economies and could lead to lower levels of consumer spending if consumer confidence declines or if individuals have
less disposable income. Any reduction in customers’ willingness or ability to spend due to Brexit-related changes in
the economic environment of the United Kingdom and Europe could materially affect Center Parcs’ revenue. A further
slow-down in the UK economy due to Brexit may also negatively impact Center Parcs’ growth strategies as well as
its operating results, financial condition and prospects.

Uncertainty surrounding Brexit has also led to a decrease in the exchange rate of the pound sterling against
the euro following the 2016 referendum and continued or sustained adverse effects on the exchange rate of the pound
sterling as compared to foreign currencies and the effective price inflation of certain goods and services sourced from
outside of the United Kingdom resulting from Brexit could result in increased costs for Center Parcs.

While Center Parcs does not currently employ a large number of EU nationals in its UK villages, the effects
of the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on free movement of EU and UK nationals and any subsequent
changes in visa requirements may have an adverse effect on EU nationals’ ability to work in the United Kingdom.
Depending on prevailing visa arrangements EU nationals may find it more difficult to work in the UK, which in turn
could lead to a tightening of the labour markets and a subsequent increase in salaries and wages in order to stay
competitive. Any such increase in salaries and wages or in benefits offered to employees could result in increased
costs.

A significant amount of EU law in matters ranging from employment law to data protection to competition
and financial regulation is currently embedded in UK law either as a result of EU regulation directly applicable in the
UK or from UK regulations implementing EU directives. Accordingly, it is also unclear what impact Brexit will have
on the UK legal and regulatory landscape, which could in turn have a significant impact on Center Parcs. Given that
the transition/implementation period has ended, subject to the terms of the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation
Agreement, EU law will cease to apply in the UK. However, many EU laws have been transposed into English law
and these transposed laws will continue to apply until such time that they are repealed, replaced or amended. Over the
years, English law has been devised to function in conjunction with EU law (in particular, laws relating to financial
markets, financial services, prudential and conduct regulation of financial institutions, financial collateral, settlement
finality and market infrastructure). As a result, depending on the final trade arrangements to be put in place, substantial
amendments to English law may occur and may diverge from the corresponding provisions of EU law applicable after
the transition/implementation period. Any substantial change in the regulations applicable to Center Parcs’ business
could jeopardise its ability to continue to operate in a manner consistent with its past practice.

Any of these factors or other events or consequences from Brexit described above may have a material
adverse effect on Center Parcs' business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Center Parcs relies on information technology in its operations and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption_**
**_or breach of security of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate its business and subject it to_**
**_data loss, litigation, liability and reputational harm._**

Center Parcs relies on its information systems across its operations, such as in the processing of payment
details, and on those of its third parties service providers, including the online booking systems provided by ATCORE
and Elite. Its ability to effectively manage its business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these
systems. A new website which provides information and booking services for Center Parcs’ spas and a new Center
Parcs website, which was rolled out in 2017, utilise the Adobe platform. Extended or widespread outages of the online
accommodation or activities booking system (including the self-service booking points on-site) could adversely affect
Center Parcs’ ability to take guest bookings (as online bookings can be made exclusively through its website).

The provision of convenient, trusted, fast and effective payment processing services to Center Parcs’ guests
is critical to its business. If there is any deterioration in the quality of the payment processing services provided to
Center Parcs’ guests or any interruption to those services, or if such services are only available at an increased cost to
Center Parcs or its guests or are terminated and no timely and comparable replacement services are found, Center
Parcs’ guests may be deterred from booking Center Parcs breaks.

Center Parcs, and third-party service providers on its behalf, collect, process and retain large volumes of
guest data, which, together with employee data and other confidential information, is entered into, processed,
summarised and reported by various information systems. Center Parcs also uses video surveillance in certain public
areas for security purposes. The footage from such surveillance is also subject to data protection and privacy laws.

47


-----

Notwithstanding the efforts and technology of Center Parcs and its third-party service providers to secure
their computer networks, the security of those networks could be compromised. Third parties may have the technology
or know-how to breach the security of Center Parcs’ guest, employee and other confidential information, and Center
Parcs’ security measures (or those of its third-party service providers) may not effectively prohibit others from
obtaining improper access to this information, destroying or stealing valuable information or disrupting Center Parcs’
operations. In addition, Center Parcs or any of its third-party service providers may lose data, including guest data and
payment details, or may fail to transmit such data online in a secure manner. In each case, if any theft or loss of
personal guest data were to occur, Center Parcs could face liability (including fines) under data protection or privacy
laws and lose the goodwill of its guests, incurring significant reputational harm. Such security breaches could have a
material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

If the guest, employee or other data held by Center Parcs is not accurate or complete, there is a risk that
Center Parcs could make incorrect decisions regarding marketing, pricing, cost management or other factors that
impact its financial performance.

Any computer virus, security breach, loss, or theft of company, guest or employee data could expose Center
Parcs to adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, regulatory action, or cause Center Parcs to incur significant costs
to reimburse third parties for damages, which could impact its results of operations.

**_Center Parcs competes for discretionary spending with other holiday offerings and holiday or leisure alternatives._**

The UK domestic holiday market is diverse. Center Parcs’ main competitors are high-end, self-catering
cottage accommodation and leisure hotels and resorts, primarily in the UK, and to a lesser extent abroad. Center Parcs’
holiday villages compete for guests’ discretionary spending with other holiday offerings, including other holiday
villages (both UK traditional holiday villages and holiday parks and UK and international destination parks). In
addition, other holiday providers could open forest villages in the UK in the future. A village’s ability to attract guests
depends, among other things, on the quality of the accommodation, competitiveness of prices, amenities and facilities
offered and the convenience and location of the village. If competing UK holiday centres provide a better offering to
guests, this may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations,
which may in turn affect the ability of the Obligors to meet their obligations under the Loans and the Issuer’s ability
to meet its obligations under the Notes.

Since the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two-hour drive of the village they choose to visit, the
effects of competition would be more pronounced if a new holiday centre or other guest attraction opened within close
proximity to one of Center Parcs’ holiday villages or if an existing holiday centre expanded into its market or began
conducting activities aimed at capturing Center Parcs’ market share.

In addition, Center Parcs may face increased competition from holiday offerings outside the UK as a result
of an increase in the convenience or reduction in the cost of air travel following easing of COVID-19 restrictions,
particularly due to the decline in global oil prices, any appreciation of the pound relative to other currencies,
particularly the euro, or inclement weather in the UK. While occupancy and ADR may increase as government
regulations or guidance restrict overseas travel resulting in an increase in demand for domestic leisure, hospitality and
tourism, once such restrictions are lifted, there is a risk that demand for overseas travel may increase substantially.
This may lead to a reduction in the demand for Center Parcs’ offerings as guests choose to partake in international
tourism, to make up for the inability to travel internationally during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may result in a
material and adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, if macroeconomic conditions are strong and/or inflation in the UK declines, there may be greater
consumer preference for holidays abroad. Further, Longford Forest in the Republic of Ireland may attract guests away
from Center Parcs’ existing villages. Reduced occupancy at Center Parcs’ existing villages for any of the above
reasons may have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of Center Parcs.

Center Parcs also competes more broadly with other types of leisure activities and forms of entertainment,
such as sports and other recreational activities, restaurants, bars, retail outlets and spa facilities.

One or more of Center Parcs’ competitors for holiday or leisure activities may be more successful in attracting
and retaining guests. If Center Parcs does not compete successfully for discretionary spending with other holiday
villages and other leisure alternatives, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected.

-----

**_Center Parcs could be adversely affected by changes in consumer tastes and expectations or its failure to maintain_**
**_and improve its villages and amenities to appeal to changing guest tastes and expectations._**

The success of Center Parcs’ holiday villages depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that
can change in unpredictable ways, and on Center Parcs’ ability to ensure that its holiday villages meet the changing
preferences of its target guests. Evolving standards of accommodation and amenities and changing guest expectations,
such as with regards to social distancing and personal protective equipment, may also affect the revenues and
popularity of Center Parcs’ villages, which require continued investment to ensure that the accommodation and
amenities in the villages are attractive and appeal to Center Parcs’ guests. Center Parcs carries out significant research
and analysis before constructing new holiday villages or opening new facilities at its villages and often invests
substantial amounts in investigating how these new holiday villages and new facilities may be perceived by guests. If
Center Parcs’ facilities or new entertainment and leisure activity offerings do not achieve targeted guest volumes,
revenues may decline. Any failure to invest, innovate or continue to improve Center Parcs’ offering in a timely manner
to meet changing consumer preferences or to retain long-term guest loyalty or provide satisfactory guest service may
have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and result of operations.

**_Bad or extreme weather conditions, road, rail or other transportation disruptions or closures and other conditions_**
**_out of Center Parcs’ control could negatively affect occupancy at Center Parcs’ villages._**

Center Parcs’ holiday villages provide both indoor and outdoor activities, with the natural setting of the
villages and the outdoor activities a major draw for guests. However, due to social distancing requirements and other
regulations by the UK government in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of Center Parcs’ activities currently
remain closed or are otherwise subject to COVID-19 restrictions. For example, as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the sub-tropical swimming paradise is closed, and many indoor activities are suspended. Center Parcs’
hotel rooms and apartments are also currently not available for use, and the food and beverage offerings at our villages
are limited to takeaways and self-catering with some outdoor beverage service available on terraces. Bad weather or
forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions can reduce the number of people who come to the holiday villages or
who book stays, which may require Center Parcs to lower prices thus reducing ADR even if occupancy remains stable.
In addition, due to the often unexpected nature of bad or extreme weather conditions, Center Parcs may fail to predict
or undertake the appropriate advanced planning to maintain business operations in the event of a disruption due to bad
or extreme weather conditions. Any such condition could also adversely affect guests’ experiences during their stay
at Center Parcs and thereby affect their willingness to return to Center Parcs as repeat guests. Bad or extreme weather
conditions (for example, floods, storms or high winds) or other occurrences outside of Center Parcs’ control (such as
fires) could also lead to the loss of use of one or more of Center Parcs’ villages, or damage the natural environment in
which the villages are situated, and disrupt its ability to attract guests to certain of Center Parcs’ villages or facilities.
Due to such conditions or for other weather-related or environmental reasons, Center Parcs’ facilities and activities
may close from time to time.

The occurrence of extreme winter weather conditions could cause significant damage to Center Parcs’
holiday villages, which could materially and adversely affect its overall business. Similarly, unseasonably high
temperatures and high winds could exacerbate forest fires. In addition, prolonged drought conditions may cause water
shortages, which could adversely impact the operation of Center Parcs’ water amenities. Center Parcs’ insurance may
not be sufficient to cover the costs of repairing or replacing damaged property or equipment, and Center Parcs may
suffer a significant decline in revenues if any of its holiday villages is closed or unable to operate all of its facilities
for an extended period of time.

The heavy snowfall and unusually low temperatures in England in March 2018 caused the temporary closure
of Longleat Forest and restricted guest arrivals and activities at all other villages. In February 2019, Longleat Forest
was closed again for a three-night period due to heavy snowfall. Guests impacted by the snow were issued refunds of
both their accommodation and on-site spend. Center Parcs believes that it experienced lost revenue from the closures
in the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018 and in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019, respectively.

Road closures or detours as a result of bad weather conditions may also prevent or delay Center Parcs’ guests, who
primarily drive to the villages, from reaching the villages. Road closures and detours have the potential of extending
the effects of bad weather beyond the particular storm or weather condition as damaged roads and highways may take
significant time to repair. Additionally, road closures and detours as a result of non-weather factors, such as
government repair works, may also reduce the number of guests.

49


-----

If transport links to Center Parcs’ holiday villages and related infrastructure are damaged or become
inadequate, guests may face difficulty in traveling to the villages, or may face significant delays and increased travel
times, which could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Center Parcs’ revenues are highest during school holidays and public holidays, which could magnify the impact_**
**_of adverse conditions or events that occur during peak demand periods._**

Center Parcs’ revenues are subject to seasonal factors and guest demand for breaks increases during school
holidays, public holidays and periods of expected favourable weather conditions, among other things, during which
Center Parcs is generally able to charge higher prices. As a result, if extreme weather, accidents or other adverse
conditions or events occur, particularly during peak holiday periods, Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and
results of operations may be materially adversely affected. For example, certain breaks during the Closure Periods
have historically been very profitable for Center Parcs, including the Easter holidays (for both 2020 and 2021), May
half-term, Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Additionally, changes in school holiday schedules or a switch to a uniform
year-round schedule could adversely affect Center Parcs’ guest bookings, and consequently its attendance levels or
target pricing levels during the peak holiday periods, which may adversely affect Center Parcs’ business, financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, any such adverse effect or condition may make it difficult for Center
Parcs to predict its operating results, which may materially and adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to implement
planned capital expenditures.

In the United Kingdom, there has been an increasing trend of the government seeking to ban or deter termtime holidays for school children. In 2017, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom upheld fines, and local
authorities continue to use fines, penalising parents taking their children out of school during term-time in the absence
of exceptional circumstances. In financial year 2020, approximately 48% of Center Parcs’ customers were families
with at least one school-age child. However, this number is likely to decline if the trend of increasingly strict
regulations and enforcement surrounding term-time holidays continues. This may result in lower demand for Center
Parcs’ villages during off-peak periods and cause Center Parcs to further reduce off-peak prices, thereby decreasing
margins.

**_Instances of injuries, illness, epidemics or pandemics, as well as negative publicity relating thereto, could result in_**
**_reduced guest attendance and materially and adversely impact Center Parcs’ business._**

As seen with the current COVID-19 pandemic, the outbreak of any prolonged pandemic or epidemic disease,
whether a further outbreak of COVID-19 or any other disease, or the occurrence of any other public health concern
could negatively impact the public’s willingness to gather in public spaces or travel or result in health or other
government authorities imposing restrictions on travel, which individually or together could reduce guest volumes or
revenues at Center Parcs’ holiday villages. In addition, any such public health concerns may severely restrict the level
of economic activity in affected areas. Any of these events, particularly if they occur during the peak holiday periods,
or the booking periods thereof, could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Instances of illness or injury in general or claims of illness relating to food or drinking water quality or
handling at restaurants, food preparation centres or holiday centres, whether or not affecting Center Parcs’ villages,
or in relation to water quality within pools and spas could reduce guest attendance materially, either through
cancellations of existing bookings or by reducing consumer willingness to visit Center Parcs. In addition, any negative
publicity relating to these and other health-related matters might affect consumers’ perceptions of Center Parcs’
holiday villages and reduce guest visits to its holiday villages.

**_Center Parcs’ insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that it could suffer, and its_**
**_insurance costs may increase._**

Companies engaged in the holiday centre business may be sued for substantial damages in the event of an
actual or alleged accident. A catastrophic loss or accident occurring at Center Parcs’ holiday villages or at competing
holiday villages may increase insurance premiums, and negatively impact Center Parcs’ operating results. Although
Center Parcs carries annual liability insurance to cover this risk, its coverage may not be adequate to cover liabilities,
and it may not be able to obtain adequate coverage should a catastrophic incident occur.

In particular, the lost revenue and increased operating costs resulting from closure of Center Parcs’ villages
due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing health and safety regulations were not covered by Center Parcs’ insurance

50


-----

policies. Any future losses resulting from additional closures or reductions in Center Parcs’ operations pursuant to
government regulations or further outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic are not expected to be covered by Center
Parcs’ insurance policies. Further, Center Parcs cannot predict how its insurance policies will change as a result of the
macroeconomic environment and other challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is possible that Center
Parcs’ insurance premiums may increase and that the scope of coverage of Center Parcs’ insurance policies may
decrease.

Center Parcs utilises a combination of self-insurance (through the use of large excesses payable by Center
Parcs) and insurance coverage programmes for property, business interruption, employer’s liability, public/products
liability and health care insurance. Pursuant to such programmes, Center Parcs is responsible for a specified amount
of claims and insures for claims above such limits.

Potential liabilities that Center Parcs self-insures or buys commercial insurance for could increase in the
future. In addition, insurance may not be available to Center Parcs on commercially acceptable terms or at all, or
Center Parcs could experience increases in the cost of such insurance. Any increase in the number of claims or amount
per claim or increase in the cost of insurance could materially and adversely affect Center Parcs’ results of operations.

The Obligors are required by the terms of the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements to insure the villages against
the risk of material damage or destruction and resulting business interruption, acts of terrorism, public and product
liabilities and such other risks as a prudent owner and operator of similar properties would insure against.

The Obligors have granted security to the Borrower Security Trustee under the terms of the Borrower Deed
of Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge for amounts which are or may become payable under all of its insurance
policies relating to material damage or destruction and resulting business interruption taken out by the relevant Obligor
in respect of the relevant village.

A failure by any of the Obligors to renew the relevant insurance policies in respect of a village may, upon
damage to the village or loss of revenue in respect to the village (which would otherwise have been recoverable under
such insurance policy), result in a corresponding loss in the value of such village or payment recovery under the loan
made to the relevant Borrower. Similarly, even where the relevant insurance policy is current, there could be an
administrative delay in the receipt of payment by the Obligors from the insurers which could affect the ability of the
Obligors to meet their respective payment obligations during that period of delay.

Certain types of risks and losses (such as losses resulting from epidemics and pandemics, including COVID19, war, terrorism, nuclear radiation, radioactive contamination and heaving or settling of structures) may be or
become either uninsurable or uneconomical to insure or may not be covered by the relevant insurance policies. Center
Parcs’ insurance policies do not compensate Center Parcs for revenue lost as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Other risks might become uninsurable (or uneconomical to insure) in the future. The occurrence of significant
uninsured or uninsurable losses could materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and
results of operations, which could result in the Obligors not having sufficient funds to repay in full amounts owing
under or in respect of the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements.

**_Any adverse impact on guest perceptions of Center Parcs Holding B.V. or Center Parcs Europe N.V., with whom_**
**_Center Parcs shares its brand, could adversely affect Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

The successor to the founder of the Center Parcs brand is Center Parcs Holding B.V., a subsidiary of French
listed company Pierre & Vacances, which operates a holiday business in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and
Germany. Under the terms of a brand sharing agreement relating to trademarks and marketing services with, among
others, CP Opco, Center Parcs Holding B.V. and Center Parcs Europe N.V. (“CP Continental Europe”), the parties
agreed that CP Opco is exclusively entitled to use the trademark registrations for the Center Parcs brand that it owns
in its territory (UK, the Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland) and CP Continental Europe is exclusively entitled
to use the trademark registrations for the Center Parcs brand that it owns in its territory (Albania, Austria, the Benelux,
Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Macedonia, Monaco, Norway, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine). Under the brand
sharing agreement, each party has exclusive rights to operate holiday centres in its respective territory using its
registered marks.

Any event or circumstance that has an adverse impact on guest perceptions of the Center Parcs brand and
holiday business outside the UK could have a material adverse effect on the reputation of the Center Parcs brand in
the UK.

**_Center Parcs’ future performance depends on continued maintenance capital expenditure and investment capital_**
**_expenditure, which may be significant. Any failure to make the requisite maintenance capital expenditure or_**
**_investment capital expenditure in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,_**
**_financial condition and results of operations._**

Center Parcs’ future performance depends on making continued maintenance capital expenditure and
investment capital expenditure, which may be significant. A principal competitive factor for a holiday village is the
uniqueness and perceived quality of its accommodation, amenities and facilities. Accordingly, the regular addition of
new or improved accommodation, amenities and facilities and the repair or maintenance of those in existence are key
to the continued competitiveness of Center Parcs’ holiday villages.

Maintenance capital expenditures include refurbishments to existing facilities, including ensuring health and
safety standards are met. Although the Obligors are required under the terms of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement to spend a minimum of £18.5 million per year on maintenance capital expenditure, there can be no
assurance that this amount will be sufficient for Center Parcs’ requirements. Center Parcs’ maintenance capital
expenditure for the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020 and the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 was
approximately £16.8 million and £14.5 million, respectively. Center Parcs’ maintenance capital expenditure for the
52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020 was approximately £27.1 million
and £27.5 million, respectively.

Investment capital expenditures include building new accommodation, upgrading existing accommodation
and adding, upgrading or expanding cafes, restaurants and other facilities. During the period of closure of its villages
due to COVID-19, Center Parcs curtailed non-essential investment capital expenditures. While Center Parcs’
investment capital expenditure for the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and the 52-week period ended 23 April
2020, was approximately £39.1 million and £25.3 million, respectively, Center Parcs expects its total investment
capital expenditure to be materially lower during the 2021 financial year. Center Parcs’ investment capital expenditure
for the 36-week periods ended 2 January 2020 and 31 December 2020 was approximately £17.3 million and £8.1
million, respectively, reflecting a decrease in discretionary capital expenditure in the 36-week period ended 31
December 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While Center Parcs expects to continue its investment capital
expenditures over the next several years, the development and construction of such projects not currently under
construction is subject to additional risks due to COVID-19 or otherwise, including construction delays as a result of
business activity restrictions and supply chain interruptions. As a result, Center Parcs’ current development plans may
not be completed as planned, which may impact future growth.

Center Parcs is continuing its refurbishment cycle, which typically lasts for 8 years. Center Parcs has
upgraded 2,347 lodges under the current refurbishment cycle as at the date of this Offering Memorandum.
Construction of three treehouses at Woburn Forest was completed in summer 2018, and 33 lodges at Whinfell Forest
were completed in spring 2019. Additionally, Center Parcs completed the construction of two new lodges at Woburn
Forest and four new treehouses at Whinfell Forest in summer 2020.

Historical and future investment capital expenditure may not yield the anticipated revenue or ADR growth
or improve the attractiveness of Center Parcs’ holiday villages. Even if revenues do increase, the additional revenues
may not be sufficient to recover the amounts invested by Center Parcs and to provide a return on such investments. In
addition, if Center Parcs does not have sufficient liquidity to finance these upgrades or if insufficient amounts are
spent on capital expenditure on the villages, Center Parcs’ villages may not remain competitive.

There could be a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of
operations if it fails to maintain the planned approach to its maintenance and investment cycle and/or if any investment
that does not result in revenue growth does not otherwise recover the amount invested or does not maintain the longterm attractiveness or good and safe condition of the relevant holiday village. Moreover, delays in the addition of new
or improved accommodation, amenities and facilities or the closure of any of its amenities and facilities for repairs
could adversely affect occupancy levels and Center Parcs’ ability to realise revenue growth, which could have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Failure to keep pace with developments in technology or any problems with maintaining or implementing upgrades_**
**_to Center Parcs’ IT systems could impair Center Parcs’ operations or competitive position._**

52


-----

The holiday centre industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems, including
those systems and technologies used for Center Parcs’ bookings, revenue management and property management
platforms. These technologies and systems must be refined, updated and/or replaced with more advanced systems on
a regular basis. If Center Parcs is unable to do so as quickly as its competitors, within budget cost and time frames or
at all, its business could suffer. Center Parcs is in the process of making updates to existing systems and introducing
new IT systems and technologies aimed at improving pricing for bookings, targeting new and repeat customers,
strengthening and integrating customer relationship management processes. Any problems with transitioning to or
integrating its new systems could adversely affect Center Parcs’ business. In particular, the implementation of the new
IT systems could take longer than expected, disrupt Center Parcs’ current systems and/or result in cost overruns.
Center Parcs also may not achieve the benefits that it anticipates from these systems or any other new technology or
system in the future. If any of these risks were to be realised, this could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’
business, financial conditions and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs may not be able to successfully develop new villages and it may not realise desired returns from new_**
**_villages or other villages it may acquire._**

From time to time, Center Parcs evaluates suitable locations for new villages to develop or acquire and is
currently finalising negotiations for an option agreement for a potential sixth site in the UK. Holders of the Class B6
Notes will have recourse to any additional villages that Center Parcs constructs or acquires in the United Kingdom
only if and when certain conditions under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement are satisfied following
completion of the development of such additional villages. See “—Risks Relating to the Offered Notes—The revenues
_derived from any additional village that Center Parcs constructs or acquires in the United Kingdom will not benefit_
_the Restricted Group unless and until certain conditions in the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements that allow accession_
_of additional sites to the Restricted Group are satisfied and the formal accession process is completed.” Any new_
village development would be subject to planning permission and other relevant consents and there can be no
assurance that such consents will be received. See “The operation and development of Center Parcs’ holiday villages
_are subject to planning and other consents, laws and regulations, which may constrain future development or new_
_facilities and amenities. In addition, changes in use or planning consents relating to property neighbouring the_
_villages may have a material detrimental effect on guests’ enjoyment of the villages.” Center Parcs may not be able to_
successfully identify and secure such locations or may not be able to successfully execute opening such villages.

New villages may fail to become operational on a timely basis or at all due to setbacks including but not
limited to delays or failure to receive planning permissions or other consents, inability to meet development requests
from local authorities, infrastructure issues, construction delays, inadequate or delayed financing, the delay or inability
to recruit or manage appropriately skilled employees or the inability to identify or secure agreements with key
suppliers or development partners. Furthermore, once opened, new villages may not attract anticipated volumes of
guests, either in the short or long term, as a result of social distancing guidelines, reduced customer demand, differing
customer expectations and preferences in these new locations or due to other factors.

The integration of a new village is a complex and time-consuming process. Center Parcs may not be able to
integrate effectively any village it develops or acquires or successfully implement appropriate operational, financial
and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from such developments or
acquisitions. Center Parcs may also be subject to unexpected claims and liabilities arising from such developments or
acquisitions. These claims and liabilities could be costly to defend, could be material to its financial position and might
exceed either the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of the
indemnifying parties. The diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in
connection with the integration of the businesses Center Parcs develops or acquires could negatively impact its
business and results of operations. Further, the benefits that it anticipates from these new developments or acquisitions
may not be realised.

Any expansion into a new country would result in Center Parcs being subject to the laws and regulations of
that country, including taxation. As a result, Center Parcs’ risk exposure to political and regulatory changes will
increase as a result of opening a village in another country. The impact of, and costs associated with, complying with
changes in interpretation of existing, or the adoption of new, legislation, regulations or other laws or licensing and
authorisation regimes in the jurisdictions in which Center Parcs has plans to operate can be difficult to anticipate or
estimate and could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of
operations. Expansion into a new country could also subject Center Parcs to risks related to adverse fluctuations in
currency exchange rates. Further, the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement permits management to only devote

53


-----

up to 25% of its time towards any additional villages located outside the United Kingdom, including Longford Forest
in the Republic of Ireland, and does not require any additional Center Parcs villages that may be developed outside
the United Kingdom to accede to the Obligor Group (as is the case for any additional villages in the United Kingdom).

Additionally, if Center Parcs wishes to use the Center Parcs brand for a village located outside of the
United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland, it must invite CP Continental Europe to participate
in all aspects of the development, funding, ownership and future management of such village. If CP Continental
Europe accepts the invitation, Center Parcs and CP Continental Europe would have to participate in the development
and management of the village on terms identical to each other. As a result, Center Parcs may not be able to effectively
integrate such village into its existing business structure, which may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’
business, financial condition and results of operations.

The occurrence of any of these factors could negatively impact the ability of Center Parcs to generate the
desired returns from its strategy of international expansion, which could have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Noteholders will not have recourse to any additional village outside the United Kingdom, its assets, revenues or_**
**_cash flow. Development of any such village may divert management’s time from villages in the United Kingdom._**

The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement permits management to devote up to 25% of its time towards
any additional villages located outside the United Kingdom, including Longford Forest in the Republic of Ireland, and
does not permit any additional Center Parcs villages that may be developed outside the United Kingdom to accede to
the Obligor Group (as is the case for any additional villages in the United Kingdom).

Longford Forest, which opened in 2019, is Center Parcs’ first village outside of the United Kingdom. Subject
to the terms of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, Center Parcs’ management is permitted to provide a
number of services to help develop and operate Longford Forest. These services include the provision of development
services such as running tender processes for contractors and using reasonable endeavours to obtain required licenses
and consents as well as operating services such as recruitment services, employee training, incorporating Longford
Forest in to the sales and marketing activity undertaken by the Center Parcs Group, the provision of customer services
such as handling general guest queries via call centre and e-mail, the provision of a reservations system and the taking
of bookings, pricing and budget setting, health & safety advice, compliance and legal support, financial reporting and
IT support together with a range of other corporate support services. Although the Longford Management Services
Agreement provides that Center Parcs will be compensated for management’s time spent on Longford Forest, these
arrangements may not sufficiently compensate Center Parcs for the cost of providing such services and may divert
management's time from the management of villages in the United Kingdom, subject to the 25% limit described above.

Under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, none of the Obligors will own assets relating to, or
derive revenues from, Longford Forest or any other additional villages outside the United Kingdom. Noteholders will
not have recourse to any such village outside the United Kingdom, its assets, revenues or cash flow. In addition, the
development of additional villages outside the United Kingdom could divert management’s time from the five existing
villages or from any additional villages in the United Kingdom and may impose additional burdens on Center Parcs’
limited management resources. This could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ financial condition, results
of operations and business.

**_Center Parcs’ business could be harmed if it loses the services of its key management personnel or is unable to_**
**_attract and retain qualified employees._**

Center Parcs’ business depends upon the efforts and dedication of its senior management team and its staff,
both in the villages and at its head office. Competition for highly-qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of the
services of any of these key personnel without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel
could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, its success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees to keep pace with its
needs. If Center Parcs is unable to do so, its results of operations may be adversely affected.

From 27 March 2020 to 3 July 2020, Center Parcs furloughed approximately 90% of its employees pursuant
to the UK government’s CJRS. Following the initial re-opening of Center Parcs’ villages on 13 July 2020, all of Center
Parcs’ employees were unfurloughed. As Center Parcs’ villages were closed again due to the re-imposition of COVID19 restrictions (such as the closure of Sherwood Village on 30 October 2020, the closure of Woburn Village on 18
December 2020 and the remaining villages from 5 November 2020 to 4 December 2020 and on 21 December 2020),

54


-----

approximately 90% of employees at each village were furloughed as they were closed. Center Parcs unfurloughed its
employees in stages as it moved towards its reopening on 12 April 2021.

There can be no assurance that all employees will return following the end of their furlough period or the
expiry of the CJRS or that employees who do return will remain at Center Parcs in the short-to-medium term if Center
Parcs’ villages are required to close or if Center Parcs’ business otherwise deteriorates. To the extent that any
employees do not return or employees face unanticipated challenges when they do return, there may be an adverse
impact on employee morale and Center Parcs’ ability to operate effectively and attract and retain qualified employees.

In addition, Center Parcs’ future business success depends in part on its ability to continue to recruit, train,
motivate and retain employees and on its ability to continue to employ creative employees and consultants. The loss
of service of any key personnel, or an inability to attract and retain qualified employees and consultants, could have a
material adverse impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs depends on third party suppliers and contractors._**

Center Parcs has key contractual relationships with a number of third parties, including suppliers, insurers,
partners, banks and payment processors. In particular, Center Parcs relies on key suppliers to carry on its operations.
These include the Big Table Group Limited (formerly known as the Casual Dining Group) (“The Big Table”), whose
offering includes Café Rouge, Las Iguanas and Bella Italia, and the World Duty Free Group (formerly known as the
Nuance Group), Center Parcs’ retail partner. The Center Parcs business model incorporates a range of service
relationships, with some food and beverage and retail offerings operated on a concession basis, others, such as
Starbucks, being licensed to Center Parcs and some “back-of-house” services provided by third parties, including
laundry services and food and beverage supplies. Center Parcs also relies on third party service providers and IT
systems such as payment processing services, ATCORE (formerly Anite), a non-affiliated third-party company, which
provides TourRes, the booking system used by Center Parcs, ESP, which provides the booking system Elite for onparc activities and restaurants and Adobe which provides the platform for certain of Center Parcs’ websites. Center
Parcs has also recently signed an agreement with Joules for retail shops to be opened at each of Center Parcs’ sites.
Joules’ retail shops were first opened at Woburn Village on 12 April 2021, with retail shops at Center Parcs’ other
villages scheduled to be opened thereafter.

The failure of one or more of the third-party suppliers and contractors to deliver or provide the services when
needed by Center Parcs or at the desired quality may have an adverse impact on Center Parcs’ operations and business.
In particular, certain of Center Parcs’ suppliers, including The Big Table and the World Duty Free Group, have been
severely impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. Center Parcs is closely monitoring its suppliers’ ongoing operations but
cannot assure that its suppliers will be able to fulfil their obligations in the future. The failure of one or more of these
third parties to fulfil its obligations to Center Parcs for any other reason, or the termination of such agreements by any
of the third-party suppliers or contractors, may also cause significant disruption and have a material adverse effect on
its result of operations, financial performance and prospects. From time to time, Center Parcs may terminate (by
agreement or otherwise) the concessionaire agreements in relation to all or some of the units operated by its
concessionaire partners. For example, Center Parcs has agreed with the World Duty Free Group that it would close a
number of its shops at Center Parcs’ villages, such as Time of Shade, Spirit and Sportique. Where such agreements
are terminated, Center Parcs will seek to re-utilise this space for the provision of alternative goods and services to be
provided either by Center Parcs or other third parties. There can be no certainty that any alternative use can be found
or that any alternative will generate commercial returns as favourable as those previously enjoyed.

Furthermore, third party suppliers may seek to increase prices for their services. If Center Parcs is unable to
negotiate limits to any price increases or find alternative third-party suppliers providing services at lower prices, such
increases may negatively impact Center Parcs’ business. In addition, material disputes may arise between Center Parcs
and third-party service providers and suppliers, which could adversely affect the relationship between Center Parcs
and such third parties. Any or all such developments could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_The operation and development of Center Parcs’ holiday villages are subject to planning and other consents, laws_**
**_and regulations, which may constrain future development or new facilities and amenities. In addition, changes in_**
**_use or planning consents relating to property neighbouring the villages may have a material detrimental effect on_**
**_guests’ enjoyment of the villages._**

Center Parcs’ villages are required to be constructed in accordance with the relevant planning permission to
ensure that the current use of the holiday villages is lawful. If the construction or use of a holiday village is not in

55


-----

accordance with the relevant planning permission, the relevant council may, in certain circumstances, require that use
to cease. Further, a council can require compliance with the conditions of any planning permission or planning
agreement, or, in certain circumstances, the alteration or reinstatement of any construction carried out without planning
permission.

All of Center Parcs’ villages are in rural locations. Center Parcs may experience material difficulties or
failures in maintaining or renewing the necessary licences or approvals for its holiday villages, which could result in
holiday village or attraction closures or fines. Stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to
zoning, land use and environmental factors could also delay or prevent development of new holiday villages in
particular locations. In the future, obtaining planning permission for future developments or new facilities and
amenities may be difficult. In addition, if any such planning permissions cannot be obtained, there are limited
alternative uses for rural sites of the size of the villages where base land values are low and alternative planning
permissions are unlikely.

The operation, development and redevelopment of recreational facilities and other structures at Center Parcs’
holiday villages and the development of new or additional villages may require consent from the relevant local
planning authorities as well as from third parties, such as landlords, development partners, finance providers and
regulatory bodies. Center Parcs may not be able to obtain the requisite planning or other consents as and when required
in respect of developments or redevelopments or the roll-out of new or additional holiday villages, and planning or
other consents may be withdrawn in relation to existing offerings at any of its holiday villages. In addition, Center
Parcs’ properties may be subject to certain restrictive covenants in favour of third parties.

Center Parcs constructed 90 new units of accommodation in financial year 2019, 12 new units of
accommodation in financial year 2020 and 12 new units of accommodation in financial year 2021 as at the date of this
Offering Memorandum. Center Parcs has planning permission for all of these new builds. From time to time, Center
Parcs plans to build additional new units of accommodation, subject to planning permission and other factors. If Center
Parcs is unable to obtain the requisite planning permissions for these additional lodges at the existing villages, it would
be unable to construct these additional lodges, which would have an adverse effect on Center Parcs’ expansion plans
for these sites.

Center Parcs works with and engages its local planning authorities with regard to issues of shared concern
that impact the development and redevelopment of its properties and the roll-out of new holiday villages, including
sensitivities to site noise, listed structures, road congestion and other traffic issues, and health and safety issues. If it
were to fail to cooperate with local planning authorities or if Center Parcs’ work relationship with such authorities
were to be adversely affected for any reason, this could negatively impact its ability to obtain the planning and other
consents necessary for the development and redevelopment of current villages or expanding into new villages, or it
could result in the withdrawal of existing consents. Additionally, possible changes to planning rules (such as the
categorisation of flood zones), or by-law distances which prohibit development within a certain distance of flood
defence structures) would, if made, adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to develop a holiday village. Additional
constraints on future development could have an adverse effect on guest numbers, which could have a material adverse
effect on its business.

Any refusal to grant, or delay in granting Center Parcs’ requested planning or other consents, or the
application of any special conditions to such consents (or breach by Center Parcs of such conditions), could have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, future planning
consents are likely to impose further conditions and/or require Center Parcs to enter into new planning agreements. In
addition, proposed regeneration schemes may adversely impact guest access to, or the operation of, individual
facilities. The constraints placed on Center Parcs’ operations by future planning consents or regeneration schemes
may be more onerous than those that currently apply, and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Changes in use or planning consents relating to property neighbouring the villages may have a material
detrimental effect on guests’ enjoyment of the villages. For example, changes in use or planning consents could permit
owners or occupiers of property adjoining or close to Center Parcs’ villages to use their property in a way that disturbs
or diminishes guests’ enjoyment of the villages or the natural setting in which the villages are located. These uses
would include the installation or use of plant and equipment (e.g. electricity pylons) or activities that emit noise or
smell, or that are inconsistent with guests’ enjoyment of a holiday in a natural environment. Any such detrimental
change, or negative publicity regarding such a change, may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs may be subject to liabilities and costs associated with its intellectual property._**

Center Parcs relies on trademarks to protect its brand. Many of these trademarks have been a key part of
establishing its business in the UK holiday market, including Center Parcs and Aqua Sana. Center Parcs believes these
trademarks have significant value and are important to the marketing of its villages. The steps Center Parcs has taken
or will take to protect its proprietary trademark rights may not provide adequate protection, and Center Parcs may not
have adequate resources to enforce its trademarks if third parties infringe its trademarks. In addition, although Center
Parcs owns its trademarks, these trademarks may infringe the proprietary rights of others and may not be upheld if
challenged. If its trademarks infringe the rights of others, Center Parcs may be prevented from using its trademarks,
any of which occurrences could harm its business. In any such event, Center Parcs could be forced to rebrand its
products and services, which could result in loss of brand recognition and may require Center Parcs to devote
significant resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, any claims of trademark infringement may
require Center Parcs to enter into a royalty or licensing agreement to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual
property, which may not be available on terms acceptable to Center Parcs.

From time to time, Center Parcs enters into agreements with third parties that permit it to use the intellectual
property of such third parties at its holiday villages. The third parties owning such intellectual property may not renew
such agreements with Center Parcs or may increase the cost for it to use such intellectual property to levels that make
it cost prohibitive or economically unfavourable for it to continue such arrangements.

**_Potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect Center Parcs’ business._**

From time to time, Center Parcs may become involved in litigation and regulatory actions as part of its
ordinary course of business. There is no guarantee that it will be successful in defending against civil suits or regulatory
actions, such as matters related to public and employee safety, food safety, employment and environmental laws and
regulations.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of an increase in legal claims from employees and
guests related to potential or alleged COVID-19 exposure at Center Parcs’ villages, including as a result of a localised
outbreak at any of the villages. There is limited precedent for such claims in the context of a major pandemic and
Center Parcs cannot predict how such claims would be resolved by the courts. Further, such claims could be timeconsuming and divert management time and resources away from operation of the Center Parcs’ villages.

Even if a civil litigation claim or regulatory investigation or claim is meritless, does not prevail or is not
pursued, any negative publicity surrounding assertions against Center Parcs’ holiday villages could adversely affect
its reputation. Regardless of their outcome, litigation and regulatory actions may result in substantial costs and
expenses and divert the attention of Center Parcs’ management. In addition to pending matters, future litigation,
government proceedings, labour disputes or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of
Center Parcs’ normal business operations, which may have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,
financial condition and results of operations. See “Business – Legal Proceedings”.

**_Center Parcs is subject to privacy and data protection laws and any data breach or change in legislation could_**
**_adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to market its products effectively._**

In the ordinary course of business, Center Parcs collects, transmits and stores guest and employee data,
including highly sensitive personally identifiable information, in information systems that it maintains. Center Parcs
has a large guest database made up of prospective, current and former guests. This data could be a target for cyberattack. While the protection of such guest and employee data is critical to Center Parcs and Center Parcs takes steps
to protect such data, any such attack could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Furthermore, Center Parcs’ use of this information is subject to numerous laws, regulations and standards
designed to protect sensitive or confidential client and employee data. The General Data Protection Regulation
(“GDPR”) began to apply from 25 May 2018 and introduced significant changes to data protection law. In particular,
the GDPR contains much higher penalties for breaches, new obligations for data processors, increased accountability,
expanded rights for data subjects and an extended territorial scope. Center Parcs seeks to ensure that procedures are
in place to ensure compliance with the relevant data protection regulations by its employees and any third-party service
providers. However, further changes may be required in respect of the way Center Parcs collects, stores and otherwise
processes personal data as the market adjusts to the developing interpretation and application of relevant data

protection legislation. Any future changes to data protection regulations may be significant or costly and may have a
material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

On 31 January 2020 the UK withdrew from membership in the EU and on 31 December 2020 the Brexit
Transition Period ended with the UK and the EU implementing the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. See
_“—Risks Relating to our Business and Industry—Center Parcs’ business is currently located entirely in England. As_
_a result, changes in the British holiday market, including as a result of Brexit, may have a more significant adverse_
_effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations than on more geographically diverse_
_holiday businesses.” The GDPR (as it was applied at the end of the transition period) was incorporated into UK law_
at the end of the transition period under the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and certain UK Brexit related regulations.
As a result of the UK’s exit from the EU, the UK is now a third country for the purpose of the GDPR rules regarding
personal data exports from the EEA, meaning that in the absence of an “adequacy” finding from the European
Commission, organisations exporting personal data from the EEA to the UK may be required to implement additional
safeguards in respect of any such data exports, for example standard contractual clauses or Binding Corporate Rules.
The EU UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement includes a bridging mechanism under which the UK will be deemed
not to be a third country for these purposes, such that additional safeguards will not be required, for an interim period
of up to four months from the Agreement coming into force (potentially extendable by two further months), provided
that during this interim period the UK does not exercise certain powers within its data protection laws without EU
agreement, and the UK does not change its data protection laws. This interim period is intended to give the European
Commission time to perform an “adequacy” assessment in respect of the UK. If the European Commission does not
make an “adequacy” finding in respect of the UK by the end of the interim period or an “adequacy” finding is made
and subsequently revoked, Center Parcs may be required by the GDPR to implement additional safeguards in respect
of any data transfers it makes from the EEA to the UK, which might impose an additional administrative and cost
burden on its business. Where relevant, Center Parcs has put in place data transfer agreements. Under UK data
protection laws, the EEA is considered to be an “adequate” destination for exports of personal data from the UK, and
so UK data protection law does not currently require additional safeguards in respect of any such data exports.

Despite its efforts to ensure that its employees and any third party service providers apply with any relevant
data protection regulations, including the GDPR, Center Parcs is exposed to the risk that employee or guest data could
be wrongfully appropriated, lost, disclosed, stolen or processed in breach of data protection regulations. For example,
Center Parcs recently experienced a breach of employee personal data. The breach was detected promptly and notified
to the regulator, which did not undertake enforcement action, and related legal claims by employees were covered by
insurance. If Center Parcs, or any of the third-party service providers on which it relies, fail to store or transmit guest
or employee information and online payment details in a secure manner, or if any loss of personal customer data were
otherwise to occur, Center Parcs could face liability under data protection laws and be subject to legal claims by
affected individuals.

Center Parcs’ holiday villages rely on its guest database and a variety of direct marketing techniques,
including email marketing. Any expansion of existing, and/or implementation of new, laws and regulations regarding
marketing, solicitation, privacy or data protection could adversely affect Center Parcs’ ability to utilise its guest
database for email and other marketing techniques and could result in changes to its marketing strategy. If this occurs,
Center Parcs may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could materially adversely
impact its guest numbers and revenues.

**_Center Parcs may be adversely affected by environmental requirements and liabilities._**

Center Parcs is subject to extensive and frequently changing national and local environmental laws and
regulations, including laws and regulations governing air and noise emissions; water use and wastewater and
stormwater discharges; the maintenance of above-ground and underground storage tanks; the use, release, storage,
disposal, handling and transportation of, and exposure to, oil, chemicals and hazardous substances; energy usage and
emissions; the management and disposal of waste; and otherwise relating to health and safety and the protection of
the environment, natural resources and the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater. The development and
operation of Center Parcs’ facilities require various permits and licences pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations, which can result in challenges in the applications process, constraints in on-site operations, and costs in
compliance.

Violations of environmental laws and regulations can lead to significant fines and penalties and requirements
for rectification, which could require expenditure, changes in site operations or temporary closures of all or part of the
relevant holiday centre. Such laws and regulations can impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to

58


-----

whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of contaminants. Historical land uses on parts of the village sites,
such as quarrying, timber treatment, an electrical substation, sewage discharge/treatment, and a small part of the
Whinfell Forest site that is a registered landfill (which is now closed, but is relatively close to an off-site potable water
abstraction point), may have introduced pollution or contamination into the soil and/or groundwater in parts of the
Center Parcs village sites or may have migrated beyond the boundaries of these sites. Sanctions for alleged or actual
non-compliance with environmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business,
financial condition and results of operations. Center Parcs is also subject to certain contractual requirements relating
to the environment and may incur liabilities arising from historical, existing and future environmental contamination
at properties it owns or operates now or in the future or has owned or operated in the past. The presence of hazardous
substances on a property or the failure to meet environmental regulatory requirements may cause Center Parcs to incur
substantial remediation or compliance costs or temporarily close the relevant holiday centre. In addition, if hazardous
substances are located on or released from any of its properties, Center Parcs could incur substantial liabilities through
a private party personal injury claim, a claim by an adjacent property owner for property damage or a claim by a
governmental entity for other damages, such as natural resource damages. Center Parcs is also required to purchase
carbon allowances annually commensurate with energy consumption (with allowance prices increasing each year),
and to audit energy use, both of which are subject to financial penalties for non-compliance.

Center Parcs may incur additional expenditure and other commercial and financial impacts to comply with
existing as well as new or revised environmental legislation and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and
regulations or more rigorous enforcement of such laws and regulations, as well as in connection with fulfilling
contractual obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition
and results of operations. A conviction for an environmental offence could also negatively affect Center Parcs’ ability
to contract with certain third parties in the future.

If an environmental liability arises in relation to any of the holiday villages and it is not remedied, or is not
capable of being remedied, this may adversely affect Center Parcs’ business or financial condition. This may be either
because of cost or value implications for Center Parcs and its properties or because of disruption to services provided
at the relevant holiday village.

**_Center Parcs’ existing leases are subject to early termination risks and Center Parcs may be unable to renew_**
**_headleases or obtain new leases on acceptable terms._**

The headleases for Elveden Forest and Sherwood Forest expire in 2999, the headleases for Longleat Forest
expire in 2073, the headleases for Whinfell Forest expire in 2120 and the headlease for Woburn Forest expires in
2109. There is a risk that the landlord of the relevant property may terminate the headlease (and in the case of Longleat
Forest, the superior landlord may forfeit the superior leases causing the two headleases to terminate) before the expiry
of the contractual term for failure to pay rent or other breach of tenant obligation.

The rent payable under each of the headleases for Whinfell Forest, Elveden Forest and Sherwood Forest is a
nominal sum. The yearly rent payable under the headleases for Longleat Forest is currently £936,637 in aggregate
subject to upwards-only review every five years by reference to the historic increase in revenue at Longleat Forest.
The most recent rent review for Longleat Forest was settled in January 2020 and the next review is scheduled for
2025. The rent payable under the Woburn Forest lease is currently £641,412 per annum payable since March 2018
and subject to upwards only review every five years by reference to the greater of an increase in rent in line with the
retail price index, a fixed percentage increase in the passing rent or the historic increase in revenue at Woburn Forest.
Other tenant obligations in the headleases include, but are not limited to, an obligation to keep the properties in good
and substantial repair. A failure to pay rent, including as a result of any rent increases, or other breach of tenant
obligation may result in an early termination of the relevant lease. Any early termination, delay in or inability to renew
Center Parcs’ existing leases may negatively impact its ability to operate its villages. Each Obligor has undertaken in
the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements to pay, when due, all sums payable by it under each headlease, to perform and
observe all of its material covenants under each headlease and not to commit a material breach of any headlease.

The headleases for Whinfell Forest and Longleat Forest do not contain mortgagee protection provisions in
the event of forfeiture. The Woburn Forest headlease does contain mortgagee protection provisions and therefore,
before the landlord can forfeit the headlease, it is obliged to notify the mortgagee of its intention to do so, giving the
mortgagee, within a period of three months, the opportunity to i) enter into a deed of covenant with the landlord to
comply with the tenant obligations in the lease or ii) procure an assignment of the lease to a third party in accordance
with the terms of the headlease. If a landlord were to seek to forfeit a headlease, the Obligor owning the property and
the Borrower Security Trustee would have a right to apply to the English courts to seek relief from forfeiture. The

59


-----

headleases for Elveden Forest and Sherwood Forest contain a proviso in the forfeiture clause that in the event of the
landlord serving notice on the tenant alleging breach of any material covenant by the tenant, the landlord must
contemporaneously serve a copy of the notice on any mortgagee of which the landlord has notice and the landlord
must give not less than ten days’ prior notice to any mortgagee to exercise any right of re-entry.

**_Any property on which the villages are located may be subject to compulsory purchase._**

Any property in the United Kingdom may at any time be compulsorily acquired by a public authority
possessing compulsory purchase powers (for instance, local authorities and statutory undertakings (including
electricity, gas, water and railway undertakers) in respect of their statutory functions) if it can demonstrate that the
acquisition is required. Where any land is acquired through compulsory purchase, compensation would be payable to
Center Parcs as a result. However, any such compensation may not reflect the value to Center Parcs of the affected
land.

Any promoter of a compulsory purchaser order would need to demonstrate that compulsory purchase was
necessary or desirable for the promoter’s statutory functions and for, or in, the public interest. As a general rule, in the
event of an order being made in respect of all or any part of any holiday village, compensation would normally be
payable on the basis that it be broadly equivalent to the open market value of all owners’ and tenants’ proprietary
interests in the portion of the village subject to compulsory purchase at the time of the related purchase, so far as those
interests are included in the order. Compensation would normally be payable in respect of the land acquired and the
diminution in value of any retained land, reduction in rent and other adverse impacts of the compulsory purchase
scheme.

There is often a delay between the compulsory purchase of a property and the payment of compensation,
although advance payment of compensation is available representing 90% of the amount of compensation which the
acquiring authority considers is due (where the acquiring authority takes possession before compensation has been
agreed).

Compulsory purchase of all or any significant portion of property relating to the villages, or the payment of
compensation that does not reflect the value to Center Parcs of affected land, may have a material adverse effect on
Center Parcs’ financial condition and results of operations.

**_Work stoppages, increased staff costs, and other employee problems could negatively impact Center Parcs’ future_**
**_profits._**

A lengthy strike or other work stoppage at one of the holiday villages could have an adverse effect on Center
Parcs’ business and results of operations. Center Parcs’ employees are not unionised, but some of Center Parcs’
employees are, or may in the future be, represented by works councils. Center Parcs may experience union activity in
the future which could negatively impact Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, staff costs are a primary cost component in operating Center Parcs. Increased staff costs, due to
competition for available workers, increased minimum wage or employee benefit costs, changes in labour laws or
otherwise, could adversely impact Center Parcs’ operating expenses. For example, costs of medical benefits may
increase significantly due to regulations, macroeconomic conditions and other factors beyond Center Parcs’ control.

**_Acts of terrorism may negatively impact Center Parcs’ business._**

Terrorist attacks have created many economic and political uncertainties. Center Parcs cannot predict the
extent to which terrorism or security alerts may directly or indirectly impact demand for its holiday parks, or otherwise
impact its business and operating results. The occurrence of any such terrorist event near or at a village could have a
material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Center Parcs is exposed to risks in connection with the funding of its pension commitments under the Center Parcs_**
**_Senior Pension Scheme._**

Center Parcs currently operates the Center Parcs Senior Pension Scheme, an occupational final salary
(defined benefit) pension scheme (“FS Scheme”). Center Parcs’ current pension funding commitments in respect of
the FS Scheme are not considered material in the context of its revenue and assets. However, defined benefit pension
scheme liabilities vary over time and the regulatory regime for pension schemes in the UK is undergoing change.

Valuations of all UK defined benefit plans are required to be conducted on at least a triennial basis in
accordance with legislative requirements, and the trustees and employers of the applicable plan will be required to

60


-----

agree a recovery plan which seeks to pay off any funding deficit disclosed in the context of such valuations over an
agreed period of time. Accordingly, Center Parcs is exposed to the risk that its pension funding commitments may
increase over time in the context of subsequent valuations of the FS Scheme. The most recent valuation revealed a
deficit of £3.6 million on an on-going basis as at 31 July 2017, following which a recovery plan was agreed which
was intended to eliminate this deficit by 31 July 2023.

Under UK pensions legislation, the Pensions Regulator has “moral hazard” powers to impose liabilities
relating to defined benefit pension schemes on the employing companies of the schemes and on persons who are, or
have been, connected or associated with such employers (which in relation to the FS Scheme may extend beyond
Centre Parcs group companies to include group directors, significant shareholders and non-UK group companies), to
make contributions to the schemes (by imposing a contribution notice (“CN”)), or to put in place arrangements for the
financial support of the schemes (by imposing a financial support direction (“FSD”), in certain circumstances where
the Pensions Regulator considers it reasonable to do so. The target must have been connected or associated with the
employer within the previous six years in the case of CNs, and two years in the case of FSDs. Where a CN or FSD is
issued against a target after a liquidation or administration in the UK has commenced in respect of that target, the
relevant debt claim will be treated as a provable debt in the insolvency proceedings.

There are also provisions under the Pensions Schemes Act 2021 which are expected to come into force by
October 2021 which will be relevant to Center Parcs, group directors and third parties:

- The circumstances in which the Pensions Regulator can issue a CN will be significantly widened.

- There are two new criminal offences of ‘risking accrued scheme benefits’ and ‘avoidance of employer debt’.
Each carries a maximum penalty of unlimited fines and seven years in prison and associated civil penalties
of up to £1 million. Both of these offences are very broad in their scope. In addition, the way that the offences
have been framed in the Pension Schemes Act 2021 means that these offences target a wider range of parties
than just those connected to the pension scheme’s sponsoring employer, such as directors, as they are drafted
to apply to any person. Acts of third parties, including banks, investors, and commercial counterparties, as
well as acts of pension scheme trustees and professional advisers, could all fall within the scope of these new
criminal offences. Unless a person has ‘reasonable excuse’, criminal liability could be imposed. The Act
includes no further details on how the ‘reasonable excuse’ proviso would operate; the Pensions Regulator is
consulting on draft guidance on this proviso.

- There will also be new requirements to give advance notification and provide statements to the Pensions
Regulator about the impact of certain corporate activities on a pension scheme. These corporate activities
have yet to be determined but may include the sale of a controlling interest in or a material proportion of the
business or assets of an employer, and the grant of security giving priority over the debt to the scheme. Failure
to comply with these requirements could result in new civil penalties of up to £1 million.

As a result, Center Parcs may incur additional expenditure and face other commercial and financial impacts
to comply with existing as well as new or revised pensions legislation and regulations, new interpretations of existing
laws and regulations or more rigorous enforcement of such laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse
impact on Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE FINANCING STRUCTURE**

**_The Obligors’ ability to meet their obligations in respect of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will_**
**_depend primarily on the performance of their businesses and Center Parcs may not be able to generate sufficient_**
**_cash flows to meet such obligations._**

The Obligors’ ability to meet their scheduled payment obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement will depend upon the financial condition and performance of the Center Parcs business as a whole and
their general financial condition and operating performance, which in turn will be affected by general economic
conditions and by financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond their control. See “—The COVID-19
_pandemic has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect Center Parcs’ business, financial condition_
_and results of operations.” The obligations of the Obligors to make payments under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan_
Agreement are in each case full-recourse obligations and are not limited. Future performance of Center Parcs’ business
may not be similar to the performance results of operations of the business to date described in this Offering
Memorandum.

61


-----

Unless previously repaid in full, the Borrowers will be required to repay (i) the Class A2 Loan, the Class A4
Loan, and the Class A5 Loan on the Class A2 Loan Final Maturity Date (in respect of the Class A2 Loan), the Class
A4 Loan Final Maturity Date (in respect of the Class A4 Loan), and the Class A5 Loan Maturity Date (in respect of
the Class A5 Loan), respectively and (ii) the Class B Loans on the Class B4 Loan Final Maturity Date (in respect of
the Class B4 Loan), the Class B5 Loan Final Maturity Date (in respect of the Class B5 Loan) and the Class B6 Loan
Final Maturity Date (in respect of the Class B6 Loan) (together with the Class A2 Loan Final Maturity Date, the Class
A4 Loan Final Maturity Date, the Class A5 Loan Final Maturity Date, the Class B4 Loan Maturity Date and the Class
B5 Loan Maturity Date, the “Loan Repayment Dates”).

The ability of the Issuer to redeem the Class B4 Notes on the Class B4 Note Expected Maturity Date, the
Class B5 Notes on the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date, and the Class B6 Notes on the Class B6 Note Expected
Maturity Date is dependent on the repayment in full of the corresponding Class B4 Loan, Class B5 Loan or Class B6
Loan, as applicable, by the Borrowers. Center Parcs cannot assure holders that its business will generate sufficient
cash flow from operations or that future sources of capital will be available to it in an amount sufficient to enable the
Obligors to service their indebtedness, including the Class B4 Loan, Class B5 Loan, and the Class B6 Loan, or to fund
their other liquidity needs.

Further, a failure to repay the Class B4 Loan on the Class B4 Loan Expected Maturity Date, the Class B5
Loan on the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date and/or the Class B6 Loan on the Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity
Date will not constitute an event of default but, while the Class A Loans are outstanding, will only give rise to a Share
Enforcement Event.

**_Center Parcs has significant leverage which could adversely affect its financial condition and its ability to service_**
**_its payment obligations under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements and therefore the ability of the Issuer to_**
**_service its payment obligations under the Notes including the Offered Notes._**

Center Parcs has consolidated indebtedness that is substantial in relation to its shareholders’ equity. After
giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, Center Parcs’ pro forma total debt as at the Seventh Closing Date amounts
to approximately £1,923.5 million. In addition, Center Parcs (and the Issuer) may incur further indebtedness under, or
permitted by, the terms and conditions of the Class A Notes (the “Class A Conditions”), the terms and conditions of
the Class B Notes (the “Class B Conditions”) and the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements. Center Parcs’ relatively
high level of debt could:

    - make it more difficult for Center Parcs to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreements and ultimately for the Issuer to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Notes;

    - increase Center Parcs’ vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including
rises in interest rates;

    - restrict Center Parcs from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

    - along with the financial and other restrictive covenants under Center Parcs’ indebtedness, limit its
ability to obtain additional financing, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends other than as permitted
in accordance with the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements;

    - require Center Parcs to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to service its
indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund future working capital, capital
expenditures, other general corporate requirements and dividends;

    - require Center Parcs to sell or otherwise transfer assets used in its business in order to fund its debt
service obligations;

    - limit Center Parcs’ flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry
in which it operates;

    - place Center Parcs at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;
and

    - increase its cost of borrowing.

Any failure to pay amounts due and payable under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements could give rise to
an event of default or a Share Enforcement Event (in the case of the Class B Loans) and the Borrower Security Trustee

62


-----

may, in such circumstances, elect to declare all amounts outstanding under those agreements to be immediately due
and payable and initiate enforcement proceedings against the collateral provided by Center Parcs to secure its
obligations under such agreements.

The consequences of a Share Enforcement Event are that the Borrower Security Trustee will be entitled, by
notice, to enforce the Topco Share Security in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of the Class
B Noteholders. See “Risks relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency”.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on Center Parcs’ ability to
satisfy its debt obligations, including the Offered Notes.

**_Restrictive covenants in the Transaction Documents governing the Class A Loans and the Class B Loans may_**
**_adversely affect the operations of Center Parcs._**

The Transaction Documents limit the Obligors’ ability, among other things, with respect to:

    - the incurrence or guarantee of additional indebtedness;

the payment of dividends or other distributions on, and the redemption or repurchase of, its equity;

    - the making of certain restricted payments and investments;

    - the incurrence of certain liens;

    - the imposition of restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends and other payments to
members of the Group;

    - the transfer, lease, sale or other disposition of certain assets;

    - the merger, consolidation with, or sale of substantially all of the Group’s assets to, other entities;

    - the entry into certain transactions with affiliates;

    - the entry into sale and leaseback transactions; and

    - the impairment of the security interest for the noteholders.

In addition, the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement includes other more restrictive covenants and may
restrict the Obligors’ ability to prepay their other indebtedness, including the Class B Loans, while indebtedness under
the Class A Loans remain outstanding. The ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond
the Borrowers’ control.

The restrictions contained in the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements could:

    - limit the Obligors’ ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions or meet capital needs or
otherwise restrict their respective activities or business plans; and

    - adversely affect the ability to finance the Obligors’ operations, strategic acquisitions, investments
or alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in Center
Parcs’ interest.

A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the minimum FCF DSCR
requirements in the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements could result in a default or (in the case of the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) a Share Enforcement Event.

**_Loan Events of Default may occur without the knowledge of the Borrower Security Trustee if the Borrowers fail_**
**_to notify the Borrower Security Trustee of such event._**

The Borrower Deed of Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge provide that the Borrower Security Trustee
will be entitled to assume, unless it is otherwise disclosed in any investor report or compliance certificate or the
Borrower Security Trustee is expressly informed otherwise, that no Loan Event of Default or Potential Loan Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing. The Borrower Security Trustee will not itself monitor whether any such event
has occurred. As the Issuer is a special purpose company, it will fall to the Obligors themselves to make these
determinations as well as the determinations of the financial and operational positions underlying them, which may
be subjective. The Borrower Security Trustee shall not be obliged to make any such determinations and shall be able

63


-----

to conclusively rely on any investor report or compliance certificate provided to it without being obliged to enquire as
to the accuracy or validity of any such investor report or compliance certificate.

**_The Class B6 Notes are contractually subordinated to the Class A Notes as to payment and rank junior to the_**
**_Class A Notes with respect to the application of enforcement proceeds, other than in respect of the Topco Security._**
**_As a result, the Issuer may be unable to make payments on the Class B6 Notes when due._**

Pursuant to the applicable payment waterfall set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, payments to be made
to the holders of the Class B Notes in respect of principal and interest thereon will be contractually subordinated to
corresponding payments to be made to holders of the Class A Notes. Likewise, principal and interest payments to be
made on the Class B Loans will be contractually subordinated to payments to be made on or under the Class A Loans
and the Liquidity Facility, among other things. Furthermore, subject to certain limited exceptions, the Obligors will
not be permitted to make any payments, including interest payments, under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement, and consequently in respect of the Class B Notes, unless funded out of new equity or, on or prior to the
Financial Covenant Test Date occurring in February 2022 (for so long as a Waiver End Date Certificate has not been
delivered) the proceeds of a Class B Loan, provided that the aggregate amount of the proceeds of any Class B Loan
that is applied to pay interest in respect of the Class B Loans may not exceed £75 million, and consequently the Issuer
may not be able to make corresponding interest payments on the Class B6 Notes if the Class A Restricted Payment
Condition is not satisfied, including if the Class A FCF DSCR falls below 1.35x.

Furthermore, the Class B6 Notes rank junior to the Class A Notes, and debt outstanding under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement ranks junior to debt outstanding under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement
and the Liquidity Facility, among others, in each case in respect of the application of any amounts realised through
the enforcement of the security granted under the Issuer Security Documents and the Borrower Security Documents,
respectively. Accordingly, the proceeds of any enforcement of such security may not be sufficient to meet the
Obligors’ payment obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or the Issuer’s payment obligations
with respect to the Class B6 Notes following the application of such proceeds towards the full repayment of Center
Parcs’ prior ranking debt described above. However, the Class B6 Notes benefit from the Topco Payment Undertaking
and the Topco Security, which security will not be shared with the Class A Notes. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements — Topco Payment Undertaking” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —_
_Topco Security Agreement.”_

In addition, for so long as the Class A Notes and the Class A Loans are outstanding, the holders of the Class
B6 Notes will not be able to declare a Class B Note Event of Default or a Class B Loan Event of Default.

See “— Risks Relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency,” “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements — Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement”_ and “Description of the Class B6 Loan” for further
details.

**_Topco is a holding company and will depend upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the_**
**_Topco Payment Undertaking._**

Topco is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other than
investments its subsidiaries. Topco will depend upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries to meet its
obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking, pursuant to which Topco has undertaken to pay to the Borrower
Security Trustee all principal, interest and other amounts outstanding under the Class B Loans then outstanding in
certain circumstances, including in the event that the Class B6 Loan is not repaid in full on the Class B6 Loan Expected
Maturity Date. If Topco’s subsidiaries do not, or are unable to, distribute cash to Topco in an amount sufficient to
enable Topco to meet its obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking, Topco will not have any other source of
funds that would allow it to make the necessary payments to the Borrower Security Trustee. Failure by Topco to make
such payments will give the right to the Borrower Security Trustee (on instruction from the Class B Note Trustee or,
as the case may be, the Class B Noteholders) to enforce the Topco Share Security over the shares Topco holds in CP
Cayman Limited and the share security granted to the Borrower Security Trustee by CP Cayman Limited over the
shares it holds in Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited. The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will also restrict the ability of Topco’s subsidiaries to move cash within the Group.
Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of Topco’s subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or
distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. Any such inability to transfer cash within the
Group may mean that even though the relevant entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to enable Topco
to meet its obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking, they may not be permitted to make the necessary

64


-----

transfers from one entity to another in order to make payments, directly or indirectly, to Topco. Accordingly, Center
Parcs can provide no assurances that Topco will be able to meet its obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking
should the need arise. In addition, the Topco Payment Undertaking is limited in recourse to the Topco Secured
Property and after enforcement of the Topco Security Documents, Topco’s obligations under the Topco Payment
Undertaking will be deemed to be discharged in full. If amounts outstanding under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement have not been paid in full following the enforcement of the Topco Security, such amounts will remain
outstanding and holders of the Class B4 Notes, the Class B5 Notes, and the Class B6 Notes will not be entitled to call
a Class B Loan Event of Default until the earlier of the day on which all amounts outstanding under the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement are paid in full or the Class B4 Note Final Maturity Date, the Class B5 Note Final
Maturity Date, and the Class B6 Note Final Maturity Date, as applicable.

**_Center Parcs may not be able to redeem: (i) the Class B4 Notes in full on the Class B4 Note Expected Maturity_**
**_Date, which falls 23 years earlier than the Class B4 Note Final Maturity Date; (ii) the Class B5 Notes in full on_**
**_the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date, which falls 24 years earlier than the Class B5 Note Final Maturity_**
**_Date; or (iii) the Class B6 Notes in full on the Class B6 Note Expected Maturity Date, which falls 24 years earlier_**
**_than the Class B6 Note Final Maturity Date and thereafter, interest on the Class B4 Notes, the Class B5 Notes, and_**
**_the Class B6 Notes, as applicable, will be deferred._**

The Issuer’s ability to redeem the Class B4 Notes in full on the Class B4 Note Expected Maturity Date will
depend on the repayment in full of the Class B4 Loan by the Borrowers on the Class B4 Loan Expected Maturity Date.
The Issuer’s ability to redeem the Class B5 Notes in full on the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date will depend
on the repayment in full of the Class B5 Loan by the Borrowers on the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date. The
Issuer’s ability to redeem the Class B6 Notes in full on the Class B6 Note Expected Maturity Date will depend on the
repayment in full of the Class B6 Loan by the Borrowers on the Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date. This, in turn,
will depend on many factors beyond the Issuer’s or Center Parcs’ control, including general economic conditions and
financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, together with the other risks described in this Offering
Memorandum. As a result, there can be no guarantee that Center Parcs will have sufficient funds available to repay:
(i) the Class B4 Loan on the Class B4 Loan Expected Maturity Date and consequently that the Issuer will have
sufficient funds to redeem the Class B4 Notes in full on the Class B4 Note Expected Maturity Date; (ii) the Class B5
Loan on the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date and consequently that the Issuer will have sufficient funds to
redeem the Class B5 Notes in full on the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date; or (iii) the Class B6 Loan on the
Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date and consequently that the Issuer will have sufficient funds to redeem the Class
B6 Notes in full on the Class B6 Note Expected Maturity Date. The Class B4 Note Expected Maturity Date is on 28
August 2025, while the Class B4 Note Final Maturity Date is on 28 February 2047. The Class B5 Note Expected
Maturity Date is on 28 August 2026, while the Class B5 Note Final Maturity Date is on 28 August 2050. The Class
B6 Note Expected Maturity Date is on 28 August 2027, while the Class B6 Note Final Maturity Date is on 28 August
2051.

Furthermore, the yield to maturity of the the Class B4 Notes, the Class B5 Notes, and the Class B6 Notes
will depend on, among other things, the amount and timing of repayment and prepayment of principal on the the Class
B4 Loan, the Class B5 Loan, or the Class B6 Loan, as applicable, and the price paid by the holders of the Class B4
Notes, the Class B5 Notes, and the Class B6 Notes, as applicable. Such yield may be adversely affected by a higher
or lower than anticipated rate of prepayment on the Class B4 Loan, the Class B5 Loan, or the Class B6 Loan, as
applicable. Timing for prepayment of the Class B4 Loan, the Class B5 Loan, or the Class B6 Loan cannot be predicted
and will be influenced by a wide variety of factors, as described above.

Accordingly, Center Parcs can provide no assurance with respect to timing of prepayments on the Class B4
Loan, the Class B5 Loan, or the Class B6 Loan or as to amounts to be prepaid and consequently the yield to maturity
of the Class B4 Notes, the Class B5 Notes, and the Class B6 Notes.

**_Sale of a Propco may have an adverse effect on the ability of the Borrowers to meet their obligations under the_**
**_Loans and ultimately affect the repayments on the Notes by the Issuer._**

Under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Obligors are permitted, subject to certain
conditions, to undertake sale and leaseback transactions in respect of one or more holiday parks. In each such case,
provided that the relevant conditions are satisfied, the Borrower Security Trustee will be required to give its consent
to the disposal, to the release of the property interest held by the relevant Propco, and (if the relevant Propco is also
being disposed of at the same time) to the release of the relevant Propco from its obligations, and from the security
interests granted by it, under the Transaction Documents.

65


-----

Under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, these conditions include (but are not limited to) (a) the
requirement to prepay, pro rata, the then outstanding Class A Loans, together with any applicable premium payable
at that time in respect of a consequential redemption of the Class A Notes and (b) that the Class A Noteholders (voting
as a single class) have approved the entry into the relevant transaction in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Note Trust Deed. A further condition which must be met is that the Borrower Security Trustee is
satisfied (by virtue of a Rating Agency Confirmation or a Ratings Assessment) that the then ratings of the Class A
Notes will not be (i) downgraded (ii) withdrawn or (iii) publicly placed on review for possible downgrade, as a result
of the relevant sale and leaseback transaction. See “Description of Other Indebtedness — Class A Issuer/Borrower
_Loan Agreement” for a fuller description of the conditions which must be satisfied in order for the Obligors to be_
entitled to undertake sale and leaseback transactions in respect of the holiday parks. There are no restrictions under
the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement to undertake a sale and leaseback.

There is a risk that the potential benefits (in particular financial de-leveraging) of any sale and leaseback
transaction may not be fully realised as initially anticipated. In particular, there is a risk that rent increases (although
required to be capped at an average of 4% per annum) may become a financial burden for the Obligors which
eventually affects the Issuer’s ability to make payments of principal and interest under the Class A Notes and the Class
B Notes.

Further, there is a risk that following a sale and leaseback of a Propco or a holiday park to a third party, such
lease might be terminated or forfeited by the relevant landlord with negative consequences for the Obligors. Risks
might arise such as the Obligors losing the use of a site and finding difficulty in locating a comparable replacement,
loss of income from the relevant holiday park and the introduction of competition to the remaining holiday parks
secured in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee through the development of the forfeited site as an alternative
holiday destination.

**_Challenges by secured creditors of the financing transactions described in this Offering Memorandum could have_**
**_a negative impact on other secured creditors._**

The financing transactions described in this Offering Memorandum have been structured based on English
law and practice as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum. It is possible that a secured creditor which is
subject to laws other than the laws of England and Wales may seek to challenge the validity and/or enforceability of
one or more features of the financing structure under the local laws of such creditor’s jurisdiction. Potential investors
should be aware that the outcome of any such challenge may depend on a number of factors, including but not limited
to, the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than England and Wales. There can be no assurance that any
challenge would not adversely affect directly or indirectly the rights of the other secured creditors, including the
holders of Class B6 Notes, the market value of the Class B6 Notes and/or the ability of the Issuer to make interest and
principal payments on the Class B6 Notes.

**_Center Parcs is exposed to the creditworthiness of third party financial institutions._**

The creditworthiness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, derivative,
trading, clearing or other relationships among the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened
defaults by, one institution (or more) could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or
defaults by other institutions. This may adversely affect the financial institutions, such as banks and insurance
providers, with which Center Parcs interacts on a regular basis, and therefore could adversely affect its ability to raise
needed funds or access liquidity. See “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and_ “Description of other
_Indebtedness.”_

**RISKS RELATING TO TAXATION**

**_Change of tax law and practice might have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Issuer or the Obligors._**

The structure of the transaction, the issuance of the Offered Notes, the ratings that are to be assigned to them
and the statements in relation to taxation set out in this Offering Memorandum are based on current law and the
published practice of the relevant authorities in force or applied as at the date of this Offering Memorandum. Any
changes in such law or practice might have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Issuer or the Obligors
and no assurance can be given as to the effect of any possible judicial decision or change of law or the administrative
practice of any jurisdiction after the date of this Offering Memorandum.

**_Potential secondary tax liabilities of the members of the Obligor Group may result in a deterioration of the_**
**_Borrowers’ financial condition which may, in turn, result in a deterioration of the Issuer’s financial condition._**

Where a company fails to discharge certain tax liabilities due and payable by it within a specified time period,
UK tax law imposes, in certain circumstances (including where that company has been sold so that it becomes
controlled by another person), secondary liability for those overdue taxes on other companies that are or have been
members of the same group of companies, or are or have been under common control, for tax purposes with the
company that has not discharged its tax liabilities.

Bidco Parent, Bidco, CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited, Topco, CP Cayman Limited and the Obligors have each
undertaken in the Tax Deed of Covenant that no steps have been or will be taken by it or any other member of the
Group which could be expected to give rise to a secondary tax liability for the Borrowers. If any secondary tax
liabilities arise in the Borrowers (whether in respect of a primary tax liability of a member of the Obligor Group or of
another company with which the Borrowers are or have been grouped or under common control for UK tax purposes),
and those secondary tax liabilities are not discharged by Bidco Parent, Bidco, CP Cayman Midco 1 Limited, Topco,
CP Cayman Limited or any other member of the Obligor Group, and are of significant amounts, the financial condition
of the Borrowers could be adversely affected.

As a general matter, where companies are treated as members of a VAT group, any supply of goods or
services made by or to any member of the group (other than any such supply which is made by or to another member
of the group) is treated as made by or to the representative member of that group. CP Opco (in its capacity as the
representative member of the VAT group) is, therefore, the person required to account to H.M. Revenue & Customs
(“HMRC”) for any VAT chargeable on any supply made by or to any member of the VAT group (to or by any person
other than another member of the VAT group). All the other members of the VAT group are jointly and severally
liable for any VAT due from CP Opco to HMRC during their period of membership of the group. CP Opco (in its
capacity as the representative member of the VAT group) has undertaken in the Tax Deed of Covenant that it has paid
and will continue to pay all VAT payable by it to HMRC and to comply with all laws and regulations relating to VAT.
However, if such payments are not made and are of significant amounts, this may have a material adverse effect on
Center Parcs’ financial condition and results of operations. No company which is not an Obligor is a member of the
VAT group of which CP Opco is the representative member.

**_Borrowers’ UK tax position may change which may adversely affect the ability of the Borrowers to repay the_**
**_Class A Loans and Class B Loans and so the ability of the Issuer to repay the Offered Notes._**

There can be no assurance that UK tax law and practice will not change in a manner (including, for example,
an increase in the rate of corporation tax, such as the UK Chancellor’s recent announcement of a change to the main
corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, from 2023) that would adversely affect the ability of the Borrowers to repay
amounts of principal and interest under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements. Similarly, UK tax law and practice
can be subject to differing interpretations and the Borrowers’ interpretation of the relevant tax law as applied to their
transactions and activities may not coincide with that of HMRC. As a result, transactions of the Borrowers may be
challenged by HMRC and any profits of the Borrowers from their activities in the UK may be assessed to additional
tax which may adversely affect the ability of the Borrowers to repay amounts of principal and interest under the
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements. If, in turn, the Issuer does not receive all amounts due from the Borrowers under
the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements, the Issuer may not have sufficient funds to enable it to meet its payment
obligations under the Offered Notes and/or any other payment obligations ranking in priority to, or equally with, the
Offered Notes.

**_The payments on the Loans may be subject to withholding tax which may result in a prepayment of the Loans, and_**
**_so an early redemption of the Offered Notes, and may also impact on the Borrowers’ ability to repay the Loans in_**
**_full, and so the Issuer’s ability to repay the Offered Notes in full._**

The Borrowers will be required to make payments of interest to the Issuer under the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements without deduction or withholding for or on account of UK income tax if and for so long as the Issuer is
and continues to be a person who is entitled to receive such payments gross of such a deduction or withholding (and
the Borrowers reasonably believe this to be the case). The Issuer has been advised that it was such a person as at the
Closing Date, the Second Closing Date, the Third Closing Date, the Fourth Closing Date, the Fifth Closing Date and
the Sixth Closing Date and will be such a person as at the Seventh Closing Date.

In the event that any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax is required to be made from any
payment due to the Issuer under an Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the amount of that payment will be increased

67


-----

so that, after such withholding or deduction has been made, the Issuer will receive a cash amount equal to the amount
that it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required to be made.

If a Borrower is obliged to increase any sum payable by it to the Issuer as a result of such Borrower being
required to make a withholding or deduction from that payment under an Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the
Borrower will have the option (but not the obligation) to prepay all relevant outstanding advances made under that
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in full. If the Borrower chooses to prepay the advances made under the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer will then be required to redeem the Class A Notes. Such a redemption
would be for a redemption price equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding on the Class A Notes together with any
accrued but unpaid interest. If the Borrower chooses to prepay the advances made under the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement, the Issuer will then be required to redeem the Class B Notes. Such a redemption would be for a
redemption price equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding on the Class B Notes together with any accrued but
unpaid interest. Investors should be aware that no break costs would be payable to the Class B Noteholders (including
holders of the Offered Notes) in such circumstances.

If, in circumstances where a Borrower is required to increase payments made to the Issuer under an
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement as a result of any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax, the Borrower
does not have sufficient funds to enable it either to make increased payments to the Issuer or to repay the relevant
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer’s ability to make timely payments of interest and principal under the
Offered Notes could be adversely affected.

**_If the Issuer were to cease to qualify as a securitisation company, this may have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s_**
**_UK tax position, which could adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make timely payment of interest and principal_**
**_under the Notes (including the Offered Notes)._**

The Issuer is incorporated in Jersey and resident for tax purposes in the UK and has been advised that it
should be a “securitisation company” for the purposes of the Taxation of Securitisation Companies Regulations 2006
(SI 2006/3296) (as amended). Accordingly, the Issuer should be subject to corporation tax in the UK on its “retained
profit” only, in accordance with the special regime for securitisation companies as provided for by those regulations.

If the Issuer were to cease to qualify as a securitisation company for the purposes of those regulations, this
may have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s UK tax position, which could adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make
timely payment of interest and principal under the Offered Notes.

**_The Corporate Interest Restriction Rules or Anti-Hybrid Rules could affect the Borrowers’ ability to obtain tax_**
**_deductions for all their finance expenses which could have an adverse effect on their financial position and their_**
**_ability to meet their payment obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement._**

With effect from 1 April 2017, Part 10 of the Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Act (TIOPA)
contains the “corporate interest restriction” (CIR) rules, which, where applicable, provide for the disallowance for
corporation tax purposes of some or all of the financing expenses, including interest expenses, of UK resident
companies. Under the CIR rules, financing expenses of UK group companies can be non-deductible for corporation
tax purposes by reference to the net-tax interest expense of the “worldwide group” of which they are a member. The
composition of the worldwide group is largely determined by accounting consolidation.

The application of the CIR rules to the Borrowers, and therefore whether any “allocated disallowance” will
arise to them, depends in part on the composition of the “worldwide group” of which they are members. The
composition of the “worldwide group” depends on the accounting group of which the Borrowers form part. Currently,
the Group takes the view that it is not part of the wider Brookfield group for CIR purposes and forms its own worldwide
group. On that basis, the Group expects to use the “group ratio” rather than the “fixed ratio” method for the purposes
of calculating the financing expenses allowance on the basis that the fixed ratio would result in a greater disallowance
for corporation tax purposes of some or all of the financing expenses of UK group companies within the Group. There
can be no assurance that, should the Borrowers’ accounting group change (for example, because of a divestment of
the Center Parcs Group by Brookfield), or other facts or circumstances arise which affect the application of the “group
ratio” or the “fixed ratio” to the Group, allocated disallowances would not arise to the Borrowers that would require
them to leave out of account tax-interest expense amounts, which broadly means that some or all of their financing
expenses, including interest, may not be deductible for corporation tax purposes. Similarly, UK tax law and practice
can be subject to differing interpretations and the Borrowers’ interpretation of the CIR rules may be challenged by
HMRC.

68


-----

Part 6A TIOPA contains rules (the Anti-Hybrid Rules) which can disallow financing expenses of UK resident
companies in certain circumstances, in particular where as a result of the application of non-UK tax rules there is a
deductible payment made by a hybrid entity which is also treated as deductible in calculating the net income of another
person. Members of the Group have made elections for US tax purposes which mean that they are treated as transparent
for US tax purposes, and are therefore “hybrid entities” for these purposes. The application of the Anti-Hybrid Rules
to the Group is therefore dependent on the presence of US investors in the Group and the US tax treatment of income
of members of the Group. Based on current facts the Group does not consider that any disallowance under the AntiHybrid Rules is required. However, there can be no assurance that, should the investors in the Group or the investment
structure change, some of the Group’s financing expenses, including interest, would not be disallowed for corporation
tax purposes.

Any of the above scenarios could result in any profits of the Borrowers from their activities in the UK being
assessed to additional tax by reason of the CIR rules or Anti-Hybrid Rules which may adversely affect the Borrowers’
post tax cash flows. In the event of a material deterioration in Center Parcs’ financial condition and result of operations,
it is possible that such impact on post tax cash flows may contribute to an adverse impact on the ability of the
Borrowers to repay amounts of principal and interest under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements.

**RISKS RELATING TO SECURITY, ENFORCEMENT AND INSOLVENCY**

**_Enforcement of the Topco Share Security is subject to certain conditions which if not met could affect the ability_**
**_of the Class B Noteholders to realise the value of the security._**

Pursuant to the Topco Share Security Agreement, the enforcement of the Topco Share Security is conditional
on the Borrower Security Trustee receiving a tax opinion that confirms that there will not be any actual or contingent
tax liability arising in the Obligor Group as a result of such enforcement of more than £10 million. As at the Seventh
Closing Date, it is not expected that such enforcement would give rise to any tax liability. However, such a liability
may arise in the future due to (among other things) a change in tax law or practice. Should a tax opinion not be
provided giving the requisite confirmations, the Topco Share Security may only be enforced if the Borrower Security
Trustee is provided with sufficient funds, other collateral or other support arrangement to mitigate any such tax liability
to the extent it exceeds £10 million. While the structure of the transaction has been established to minimise the risk of
this event occurring, no assurance can be given by the Obligors that such conditions will be satisfied at the time of
enforcement of the Topco Share Security. As a result, the amounts realised by the Class B Noteholders through
enforcement may be significantly reduced and/or delayed.

**_The enforcement and disposal of the Borrower Secured Property by the Borrower Security Trustee may impact the_**
**_amounts realised by the holders of the Class B4 Notes, the Class B5 Notes and the Class B6 Notes._**

Pursuant to the term of the Intercreditor Agreement, whilst the Class A Notes are outstanding, only the
Class A Noteholders are entitled to direct the Class A Note Trustee, which, in turn, will direct the Issuer Security
Trustee and then the Borrower Security Trustee with regard to the enforcement of any Borrower Security. Neither the
Class A Note Trustee nor the Issuer Security Trustee will be obliged to take into consideration the interests of the
Class B Noteholders when acting in accordance with the directions received from the Class A Noteholders or in
exercising their discretion in relation to enforcement. The Class B Noteholders and any other Secured Creditors will
be required to take any action (for example, release security and/or guarantees) that the Class A Noteholders and/or
the Class A Note Trustee and/or the Issuer Security Trustee (as the case may be) require of them to enforce the
Borrower Security including the extinguishment of all amounts due under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement in connection with an enforcement of the Borrower Security. All amounts realised by the enforcement of
the Borrower Security will be applied in accordance with the relevant Priorities of Payments as stipulated in the
Intercreditor Agreement. There is therefore a risk that the Class B Noteholders’ interests will not be aligned with those
of the Class A Noteholders and that the Class B Note Trustee will be directed to act against the wishes of the Class B
Noteholders, and without their control for so long as the Class A Notes remain outstanding. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement”._

For so long as there are any Class B Notes outstanding, the Borrower Security Trustee may only dispose of
any Borrower Secured Property with a value above £10 million if a fairness opinion from a financial advisor is first
obtained. However, the appointment of a financial advisor in such circumstances by the Borrower Security Trustee
may be directed by the Issuer Security Trustee on behalf of the Class A Noteholders only, and the Borrower Security
Trustee shall not be obliged to take into account the interests of any Secured Creditor (other than the Class A
Noteholders) and may only seek direction from the Issuer Security Trustee on behalf of the Class A Noteholders in

69


-----

relation to the method and timing of the enforcement of such Borrower Secured Property and any matter relating to
the fairness opinion. In the event that a fairness opinion is not able to be produced, the disposal of any Borrower
Secured Property will be undertaken by way of a competitive marketing and sales process typical for such type of
assets. Amounts realised by such a sales process could be less than amounts recovered in a sale by the Borrower
Security Trustee. The fairness opinion will only be required if there are Class B Notes outstanding.

In addition, upon the occurrence of a Loan Event of Default, the Borrower Security Trustee has the power to
appoint an administrative receiver who would take control of all the assets of the English Obligors. Such receiver has
wide powers that would enable him to control the English Obligors and manage Center Parcs’ business in order to
repay the secured debt. In relation to the Propcos, the receiver could endeavour to dispose of the properties, in whole
or in part, either: (i) through the sale of the Borrower Secured Property itself; or (ii) by the sale of the shares in the
Propco through enforcing the share pledge over the shares in the Propco.

In respect of any proposed disposal of the Borrower Secured Property, whether by an administrative receiver
appointed in respect of a Propco or otherwise, the relevant Borrower Secured Property could be sold subject to the
terms of the relevant headlease and the related documentation.

In respect of Longleat, the related documentation provides that the headleases (except the headlease of the
Keepers Cottage activity centre) may be transferred with the consent of the immediate landlord and the superior
landlord. However, in the case of the superior landlord, the documentation does not provide that such consent may
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Prior to any transfer of the Keepers Cottage activity centre headlease, the
Borrower Security Trustee is required to offer to surrender the headlease to the superior landlord who has ten working
days to accept a surrender of the Keepers Cottage headlease at the price stipulated in the surrender offer. Therefore, a
receiver or the Borrower Security Trustee may not be able to dispose of the Longleat property directly through a sale
of the property itself or via a special purpose vehicle unless the superior landlord was prepared to give its consent to
the assignment of the Longleat headleases on reasonable terms and does not exercise its pre-emption right in respect
of the Keepers Cottage activity centre. However, there is no restriction on a sale of the shares in the Longleat Propco.
Therefore, in such a scenario, the options available to an administrative receiver could be limited and this could
adversely affect the value which could be achieved on a sale of the Longleat property, although, as noted, this would
not prevent the disposal of the shares in the Longleat Propco to a purchaser.

**_The Borrower Security Trustee will only enforce the Borrower Security if it is instructed to do so by the requisite_**
**_percentage of Class A Noteholders or Class B Noteholders, as the case may be._**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the relevant Instructing Group will be entitled to direct the
relevant trustee to enforce and/or accelerate the Borrower Security or Issuer Security (as applicable). In the case of
any enforcement and/or acceleration of any Borrower Security and Issuer Security, if the Instructing Group is the
Class A Noteholders, then a direction may only be given if such direction is in writing by the holders of at least 25%
in aggregate of the principal amount outstanding of any class of the Class A Notes then outstanding or if so directed
by a resolution of any class of the Class A Noteholders. In the case of the Topco Security (and the Borrower Security
and the Issuer Security, if the Instructing Group is the Class B Noteholders), then a direction may only be given if
such direction is in writing by the holders representing at least 30% in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the
Class B Notes then outstanding. There can be no guarantee that the interests of different sub-classes of the Class B
Notes will be aligned or that conflicts of interests will not arise between different sub-classes of the Class B Notes in
relation to instructing the Borrower Security Trustee to enforce the Borrower Security.

**_Guarantees and security may constitute a transaction at an undervalue or preference._**

A liquidator or administrator appointed in England over an Obligor could apply to the court to unwind the
issuance of that Obligor’s guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believed that issuance of such constituted a
transaction at an undervalue. The Obligor Group believes that each guarantee will not be a transaction at an undervalue
and that each guarantee will be provided in good faith for the purposes of carrying on the business of each Obligor
and its subsidiaries and that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the transactions will benefit each such
Obligor. However, there can be no assurance that the provision of the guarantees will not be challenged by a liquidator
or administrator, or that a court would support the Obligor Group analysis.

If the liquidator or administrator can show that any of the Obligor Group or one of the Obligors have given
a “preference” to any person within six months of the onset of liquidation or administration (or two years if the
preference is to a “connected person”) and, at the time of the preference, that Obligor Group or that Obligor were
unable to pay their debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 or became unable to do so as

70


-----

a result of the preferential transaction, a court has the power, among other things, to void the preferential transaction.
For these purposes, a company gives preference to a person if that person is one of the company’s creditors (or a surety
or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) and the company takes an action which has the effect of
putting that person into a position which, in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation, will be better
than the position that person would have been in if that thing had not been done. The court may not make an order
avoiding a preferential transaction unless it is satisfied that the company was influenced by a desire to put that person
in a better position. This provision of English insolvency law may affect transactions entered into or payments made
by any of the Obligors during the relevant period prior to the liquidation or administration of such Obligor.

In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by a company was made for less than fair value
and was entered into for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of creditors, then the transaction may be set
aside as a transaction defrauding creditors. Any person who is a “victim” of the transaction, and not just liquidators
or administrators, may assert such a claim. There is no statutory time limit within which a claim must be made
(although the normal provisions under the Limitation Act 1980 will apply) and the company need not be insolvent at
the time of the transaction. The Obligors do not believe that they have entered into any transactions which may be
regarded as being for less than fair value or for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of their creditors.

**_The Borrower Security Trustee may be liable to third parties if recharacterised as a mortgagee in possession._**

The Borrower Security Trustee may be deemed to be a mortgagee in possession if there is physical entry into
possession of any village, a step-in enforcement of security or an act of control or influence which may amount, in
effect, to possession.

A mortgagee in possession may incur liabilities to third parties in nuisance and negligence and, under certain
statutes (including environmental legislation), can incur the liabilities of a property owner. The Borrower Security
Trustee has the absolute discretion, at any time, to refrain from taking any action under the Transaction Documents,
including becoming a mortgagee in possession in respect of a village unless it is satisfied at that time that it is
adequately indemnified. Subject to being adequately indemnified under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Borrower Security Trustee ranks first in respect of the Priorities of Payments, both prior to and following an event of
default thereunder, in respect of payment of any amounts owed to it under its indemnity, including in respect of the
liabilities described in this paragraph.

**_Topco and CP Cayman Limited are companies incorporated in the Cayman Islands and the Topco Share Security_**
**_Agreement is governed by Cayman Islands law. Therefore, Cayman Islands law is applicable to the enforcement_**
**_of the Topco Security._**

If insolvency proceedings with respect to Topco and CP Cayman Limited proceed under, and are governed
by, Cayman Islands insolvency law, the interests of Class B Noteholders may not be as favourable under Cayman
Islands law as the laws of other jurisdictions with which Class B Noteholders are familiar. The application of these
laws could adversely affect the ability of the Borrower Security Trustee to enforce its rights under the security interests
granted by an Obligor incorporated in the Cayman Islands and limit any amounts that may be received by the Class B
Noteholders upon such enforcement.

An official liquidator, a voluntary liquidator and a creditor have the power to apply to the Cayman Islands
court (the “Court”) for an order that any security be set aside on the basis that such security was granted in favour of
a creditor at a time when the debtor company was unable to pay its debts pursuant to section 145 of the Companies
Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands (the "Companies Act"). Any security granted by the debtor company within
six months prior to the commencement of the winding-up at a time when the debtor company is unable to pay its debts
may be challenged if the liquidator can prove that the debtor company granted the security with a view to giving a
lender a preference over other creditors. A charge granted in favour of a related party within six months of the debtor
company's winding up will be deemed to have been made with a view to giving such creditor a preference - this is not
rebuttable. A creditor shall be treated as a 'related party' if it has the ability to control the debtor company or exercise
significant influence over the company in making financial and operating decisions. If any business of a company has
been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent
purpose, the Court may declare that any persons who were knowingly parties to the carrying on of such business are
liable to make such contributions to the company’s assets as the Court thinks proper.

If the directors of Topco or CP Cayman Limited have breached their fiduciary duties to act in the best interests
of Topco or CP Cayman Limited (as the case may be) in approving the grant of the relevant security by Topco or CP
Cayman Limited, the security by Topco or CP Cayman Limited may be ineffective as against a liquidator or creditor

71


-----

of Topco or CP Cayman Limited (as the case may be) and, if the recipient of any assets under such security receives
the same with actual or constructive knowledge of such breach by the directors of Topco or CP Cayman Limited, such
recipient may be held to be a constructive trustee of such payment or assets and liable to return the same.

A Cayman Islands court may treat a purported fixed charge over assets as a floating charge if the company
has sufficient authority to deal with its assets in the course of its business and/or if the holder of security does not
exercise sufficient control over the relevant assets. Any charge in the nature of a floating charge will rank behind any
subsequent fixed mortgage or charge or lien which is created prior to the crystallisation of the floating charge.
However, advice has been taken from Cayman Islands counsel that subject to standard reservations and assumptions,
the Topco Share Security Agreement will create a valid security interest over the property intended to be secured by
such agreement in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee and the courts in the Cayman Islands will recognise such
security interests.

In the case of a winding up of a Cayman Islands company in a jurisdiction other than the Cayman Islands,
the priority of any security granted by or over the assets of that Cayman Islands company may be affected by any
provision of the laws of that jurisdiction as to the priority of claims in a winding-up. To the extent that the security is
held in the Cayman Islands, failure to comply with any restrictions or provisions applicable to the granting of security
over any such security or the transfer thereof, whether arising under Cayman Islands law generally or pursuant to
specific documentation relating to such security, may, among other things, invalidate any purported security interest.

**_The fiduciary responsibilities of Topco or CP Cayman Limited's directors under Cayman Islands law are not as_**
**_clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions._**

Each of Topco and CP Cayman Limited is an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under
the laws of the Cayman Islands. The corporate affairs of each of Topco and CP Cayman Limited will be governed by
its memorandum and articles of association and the Companies Act of the Cayman Islands and other laws of the
Cayman Islands. The rights of the Borrower Security Trustee to take action against the directors of Topco or CP
Cayman Limited and the fiduciary responsibilities of the directors of Topco and CP Cayman Limited to Topco and
CP Cayman Limited respectively under Cayman Islands law are, to a large extent, governed by the common law of
the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from judicial precedent in the Cayman
Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of English courts being of persuasive authority, but not
binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The fiduciary responsibilities of the directors of Topco and CP Cayman
Limited under Cayman Islands law may not be as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial
precedent in some jurisdictions such as the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body
of securities laws thus providing significantly less protection to investors as compared to other jurisdictions such as
the United States, which has more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of securities law.

**_Certain Obligors and the Issuer are incorporated in jurisdictions other than England and Wales and therefore may_**
**_be subject to overseas insolvency law on the security enforcement process._**

While Center Parcs (Jersey) 1 Limited (the “Jersey Obligor”) and the Issuer are incorporated in Jersey, they
are each a tax resident in the United Kingdom (from where they are controlled and all management functions are
operated).

Given the fact that the Issuer and the Jersey Obligor are managed and operated from England, and that this
is ascertainable to a third party creditor (such that the creditor would assume their COMI was in England), it is likely
that the Issuer’s and the Jersey Obligor’s centre of main interests (as defined in the Insolvency (England and Wales)
Rules 2016) (“COMI”) is in England as opposed to Jersey and any insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer
could be commenced in England and conducted in accordance with the requirements of English insolvency laws. If
this is the case at the time the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened, the Issuer and the Jersey Obligor may be
subject to English administration, company voluntary arrangement, or certain liquidation proceedings. This is because
under the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) the location of a debtor’s
COMI in England and Wales remains one of the bases upon which the English courts can decide to open insolvency
proceedings. Alternatively, English insolvency law may also be applicable to the Issuer and the Jersey Obligor if a
request for assistance is made by the Jersey court to the English court under section 426 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

Even if the Issuer’s or the Jersey Obligor’s COMI were in England, or section 426 of the Insolvency Act
1986 applied, it is unlikely that it will be possible to appoint an administrative receiver in respect of the Issuer or the
Jersey Obligor in England (so as to prevent the appointment of an English administrator) using the capital market

72

exemption described in more detail below. This is because notwithstanding the fact that their COMI may be in
England, neither the Issuer nor the Jersey Obligor is likely to be considered to be a “company” for the purposes of
section 29 of the Insolvency Act 1986 since it is not formed under one of the UK Companies Acts.

If insolvency proceedings were to be opened in a place other than England and Wales, such proceedings
could be in parallel to proceedings opened in England. Such proceedings would not benefit from automatic recognition
in England—although the officeholder could apply under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations (as defined
below) which provide that foreign (i.e. non-English) insolvency proceedings may be recognised where a company has
its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity
with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction.

The UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency was implemented, subject to certain modifications,
in Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 4 April 2006 by The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, SI
2006/1030 (the “UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations”). The UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations apply
where: (i) assistance is sought in Great Britain by a foreign court or a foreign representative in connection with a
foreign proceeding, or (ii) assistance is sought in a foreign state in connection with a proceeding under British
insolvency law, or (iii) a foreign proceeding and a proceeding under British insolvency law in respect of the same
company are taking place concurrently or (iv) creditors or other interested parties in a foreign state have an interest in
requesting the commencement of, or participating in, a proceeding under British insolvency law.

Under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations, if foreign insolvency proceedings (defined to be
collective judicial or administrative proceedings in a foreign state, including an interim proceeding pursuant to a law
relating to insolvency in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the company are subject to control or supervision
by a foreign court, for the purpose of reorganisation or liquidation) are commenced in respect of a company, then,
upon application by the foreign insolvency officeholder and provided that certain requirements are met, the English
courts are required to recognise such proceedings. Any such recognition may in effect impact upon the availability of
certain types of creditor action in England and Wales and/or, provided certain further requirements are met, result in
the application of English avoidance (including claw-back) provisions.

In addition, if the relevant foreign insolvency proceedings are recognised as “foreign main proceedings”, an
automatic mandatory stay on certain types of creditor action (including the commencement or continuation of certain
legal proceedings) will apply in England and Wales and the right of the company to transfer, encumber or otherwise
dispose by the company of its assets will be suspended. In general, this stay will not restrict rights relating to the
enforcement of security or set-off (so long as these rights could be exercised in an English winding-up). However, the
foreign officeholder may also make an application to an English court to exercise its discretion to provide further
relief, including the imposition of a wider stay (which may extend to restrictions on the rights referred to above),
particularly if the foreign proceedings in question are reorganisation proceedings which, under the foreign insolvency
law, give rise to a stay on security enforcement.

**_Fixed security interests may be recharacterised as floating security interests due to the degree of control exercised_**
**_over certain underlying assets, including over bank accounts, and as a result the full proceeds of enforcement may_**
**_not be available to repay the Class B4 Notes, the Class B5 Notes and the Class B6 Notes._**

There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the
security documents governed by English law could take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as
fixed charges is not determinative.

Whether the fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security
interests will depend, among other things, on whether the Borrower Security Trustee or, as the case may be, the Issuer
Security Trustee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant assets and exercises that control in practice.

Each Borrower has established a number of bank accounts into which, among other things, rental income and
disposal proceeds in respect of the relevant villages must be paid. Each Borrower has, pursuant to the terms of the
Borrower Deed of Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge, granted security over all of its interests in its relevant
accounts, which is, other than in the case of certain operating accounts, expressed to be a first fixed charge.
Furthermore, under the Issuer Deed of Charge, the Issuer has granted security over all of its bank accounts, which
security is also expressed to be fixed security.

73


-----

Although the various bank accounts are stated to be subject to various degrees of control, there is a risk that,
if the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee (as applicable) does not exercise the requisite degree
of control over the relevant accounts in practice, a court could determine that the security interests granted in respect
of those accounts take effect as floating security interests only and that the security interests granted over the assets
from which the monies paid into the accounts are derived also take effect as floating security interests only,
notwithstanding that the security interests are expressed to be fixed. In such circumstances, monies paid into accounts
or derived from those assets could be diverted to pay preferential creditors, the costs of the insolvency process, and
certain other liabilities were a receiver, liquidator or administrator to be appointed in respect of the relevant company
in whose name the account is held. Where the charging company is free to deal with the secured assets or their proceeds
in the course of its business without the consent of the charge holder, a court is likely to hold that the security interest
in question constitutes a floating charge, whatever its other characteristics, notwithstanding that in the security
document the security interest may be expressed in words that indicate an intention to create a fixed security interest.

If the fixed security interests are recharacterised as floating security interests, the claims of (i) the unsecured
creditors of the relevant Obligor incorporated in England and Wales (or otherwise subject to insolvency proceedings
in England and Wales) or, as the case may be, the Issuer in respect of that part of the relevant Obligor’s net property
which is ring-fenced as a result of the Enterprise Act 2002 (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the
relevant Obligor, and (iii) in circumstances where a restructuring moratorium has been entered into by the relevant
Obligor under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act 1986 and administration or liquidation commences within 12 weeks of
the end of that moratorium, moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts, may have priority over the rights of
the Borrower Security Trustee or the Issuer Security Trustee, as the case may be, to the proceeds of enforcement of
such security in accordance with s176A and 174A of the Insolvency Act 1986. To the extent that the assets of the
Issuer or any Obligor are subject only to a floating charge (including any fixed charge recharacterised by the courts
as a floating charge), in certain circumstances under the provisions of sections 174A, 176ZA and 176A of the
Insolvency Act 1986, certain floating charge realisations which would otherwise be available to satisfy the claims of
secured creditors under the Issuer Deed of Charge or the Borrower Deed of Charge or the Woburn Deed of Charge
may be first used to satisfy any expenses of the insolvency proceeding, claims of unsecured creditors (up to an amount
equal to £800,000 in respect of each relevant Obligor) or creditors who otherwise take priority over floating charge
recoveries. As a result, the full amount of the proceeds of enforcement of the security may not be available to repay
the Notes.

Further, the costs and expenses of a liquidation or administration (including corporation tax on capital gains)
will be payable out of floating charge assets in priority to the claims of the floating charge-holder. Upon the
enforcement of the floating charge security granted by an Obligor subject to an English liquidation or administration,
floating charge realisations which would otherwise be available to satisfy the claims of secured creditors under the
Issuer Deed of Charge and/or the Borrower Deed of Charge and/or the Woburn Deed of Charge will be reduced by at
least a significant proportion of any liquidation or administration expenses. If an Obligor was eligible to, and did, enter
into a restructuring moratorium and subsequently entered into administration or liquidation within 12 weeks from the
end of the moratorium, the moratorium debts and certain “priority pre-moratorium debts” would have super priority
and rank ahead of expenses of an administration or liquidation and preferential debts. However, as there are broad
exclusions for companies which are party to a capital markets arrangement, the moratorium is not available to an
Obligor.

**_Floating charges given by the English Obligors may be deemed invalid for lack of consideration which would_**
**_hinder the appointment of an administrative receiver._**

Section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by
a company may be invalid in whole or in part. If a floating charge is held to be wholly invalid then it will not be
possible to appoint an administrator or administrative receiver of such company and, therefore, it will not be possible
to prevent the appointment of an administrator of such company by another party. The risk is, if a liquidator or
administrator is appointed to the Issuer or the relevant Obligor within a period of one year (or two years if the
transaction is with a connected person) (the “relevant time”) commencing upon the date on which the Issuer or that
Obligor, as the case may be, grants a floating charge, the floating charge granted by the Issuer or that Obligor, as the
case may be, will be invalid pursuant to section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986 except to the extent of the consideration
received by the relevant chargor at the time of or after the creation of the floating charge. The Issuer received
consideration (namely, the Issuer issued the Original Class A Notes and the Original Class B Notes on the Closing
Date, the Second Class A Notes on the Second Issue Date, the Class B2 Notes on the Third Closing Date, the Further
Class A4 Notes and the Class B4 Notes on the Fourth Closing Date and the Class B5 Notes on the Sixth Closing Date

-----

and has received the subscription monies therefor) and each of the Obligors will have received such consideration
(namely, the Borrowers made drawings under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements on the Closing Date, under the
Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement on the Second Closing Date, under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement on the Third Closing Date, under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements on the Fourth Closing Date and
under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement on the Sixth Closing Date). As such, during the relevant time the
floating charge granted by the Issuer will be valid to the extent of the amount of Notes issued by the Issuer, the floating
charges granted by the Borrowers will be valid to the extent of the amount drawn by the Borrowers under the
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements and the floating charge granted by each of the other Obligors will be valid to the
extent of the fee paid to the other Obligors but not valid for the full amount of the property charged. However, such
limitation on the validity of the floating charges will not necessarily affect the ability of the Borrower Security Trustee
to appoint an administrative receiver provided that the floating charge still extends and is valid in relation to
substantially all of the respective Obligor’s property in respect of the English Obligors — however, this will be a
factual question to be determined at the time of a potential appointment and the availability of this remedy is discussed
in further detail below. After the relevant time it will not be possible for the floating charges granted by each of the
Issuer, the Borrowers or the English Obligors to be invalidated under section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

It should be noted that, since the Jersey Obligor and the Issuer are incorporated in jurisdictions other than
England and Wales, it will not be possible to appoint an administrative receiver in respect of these entities in England
(so as to prevent the appointment of an English administrator) using the capital markets provisions referred to below.
Accordingly, if the Issuer’s and the Jersey Obligor’s COMI were found to be in England, they could be placed into
administration. However, it should be noted that the Issuer is structured to be “bankruptcy remote” so therefore it
should not be subject to any insolvency proceedings. The main asset-owning Obligors (namely CP Opco, CP Woburn
Opco and the Propcos) and their immediate parent companies are all English companies so therefore administrative
receivership is possible for these companies.

**_The ability of the Borrower Secured Creditors to appoint an administrative receiver may be hindered by the_**
**_application of the Enterprise Act 2002 in respect of floating charges._**

The provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the “Enterprise Act”) restrict the right of the holder of a floating
charge to appoint an administrative receiver (unless the security was created prior to 15 September 2003 or an
exception applies) and instead give primacy to collective insolvency procedures (in particular, administration).

The Insolvency Act 1986 contains provisions that continue to allow for the appointment of an administrative
receiver in relation to certain transactions in the capital markets. The relevant exception provides that the appointment
of an administrative receiver is not prohibited if it is made in pursuance of an agreement which is or forms part of a
capital market arrangement (as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986) under which a party incurs or, when such
agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £50,000,000 and the arrangement involves the
issue of a capital market investment (also defined in the Insolvency Act 1986, but generally a rated, listed or traded
debt instrument). This exception should be applicable to floating charges created by the English Obligors and assigned
by way of security to the Borrower Security Trustee. However, as this issue is partly a question of fact, were it not
possible to appoint an administrative receiver in respect of one or more of the English Obligors, they would be subject
to administration if they were to become insolvent.

It should be noted that, since the Foreign Obligors and the Issuer are incorporated in jurisdictions other than
England and Wales, it is unlikely that it will be possible to appoint an administrative receiver in respect of these
entities in England (so as to prevent the appointment of an English administrator) using the capital markets provisions.
Accordingly, if the Issuer’s and the Foreign Obligors’ COMI were found to be in England, they could be placed into
administration. However, it should be noted that the Issuer is structured to be “bankruptcy remote” so therefore it
should not be subject to any insolvency proceedings. The main asset-owning Obligors (namely CP Opco, CP Woburn
Opco and the Propcos) and their immediate parent companies are all English companies so therefore administrative
receivership is possible for these companies.

The UK Secretary of State may, by secondary legislation, modify the exceptions to the prohibition on
appointing an administrative receiver and/or provide that the exception shall cease to have effect. No assurance can
be given that any such modification or provision in respect of the capital market exception, or its ceasing to be
applicable to the transactions described in this Offering Memorandum, will not be detrimental to the interests of the
Class B Noteholders.

**_The ability of certain members of the Obligor Group to seek a moratorium which could restrict creditors’ ability to_**
**_enforce security._**

Pursuant to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, which received Royal Assent on
25 June 2020 and came into effect on 26 June 2020, a free-standing moratorium is available to protect certain
companies, both UK and overseas if there is a sufficient connection with England, from creditor action for a specified
period, granting a ‘payment holiday’ for ‘pre-moratorium debts’. Pre-moratorium debts are debts due prior to the
moratorium coming into force or debts which become due during the moratorium if they relate to obligations incurred
before the moratorium comes into force. The moratorium is similar in scope to that which applies in administration,
preventing security enforcement and legal proceedings amongst other things. In order to be eligible for the moratorium
a member of the Obligor Group must be or likely to be unable to pay its debts and the moratorium must be likely to
result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. However, there are broad exclusions including for companies
which are party to a capital markets arrangement. As a result, the moratorium is not available to members of the
Obligor Group.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE OFFERED NOTES**

**_The Offered Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors._**

Each potential investor in the Offered Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its
own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

    - have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Offered Notes,
the merits and risks of investing in the Offered Notes and the information contained in this Offering
Memorandum;

    - have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its
particular financial situation, an investment in the Offered Notes and the impact the Offered Notes
will have on its overall investment portfolio;

    - have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the
Offered Notes, including Offered Notes where the currency for principal or interest payments is
different from the potential investor’s currency;

    - understand thoroughly the terms of the Offered Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any
relevant indices and financial markets; and

    - be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial advisor) possible economic and
interest rate scenarios and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the
applicable risks.

The Offered Notes are complex financial instruments. Sophisticated institutional investors generally do not
purchase complex financial instruments as standalone investments. They purchase complex financial instruments as a
way to reduce risk or enhance yield with an understood, measured and appropriate addition of risk to their overall
portfolios. A potential investor should not invest in Offered Notes that are complex financial instruments unless it has
the expertise (either alone or with a financial advisor) to evaluate how the Offered Notes will perform under changing
conditions, the resulting effects on the value of the Offered Notes and the impact this investment will have on the
potential investor’s overall investment portfolio.

In addition, the market value of the Offered Notes may fluctuate for a number of reasons including due to
prevailing market conditions, current interest rates and the perceived creditworthiness of the Issuer and the Obligors.
Any perceived threat of insolvency or other financial difficulties of the Obligors or a less favourable outlook of the
holiday industry in the UK could result in a downgrade of ratings and/or a decline in market value of the Offered
Notes.

**_The Issuer is a special purpose company with no business operations or assets._**

The Offered Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer. The Issuer is a special purpose company
with no business operations other than the issuance of the Notes and the transactions ancillary thereto. The Offered
Notes are not obligations or responsibilities of, or guaranteed by, any other entity.

76


-----

The Offered Notes are not obligations or responsibilities of, and are not guaranteed by, the Class A Note
Trustee, the Class B Note Trustee, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners,
the Liquidity Facility Providers, the Cash Manager, the Paying Agents, the Class A Registrar, the Class B Registrar,
the Class A Transfer Agent, the Class B Transfer Agent, the Issuer Account Bank, the Borrower Account Bank, the
Borrower Security Trustee, any of the Obligors or any company in the same group of companies as, or affiliated to,
the Parent (other than the Issuer itself but without prejudice to the Obligors’ obligations to the Issuer under the
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements). Furthermore, no such person other than the Issuer will accept any liability
whatsoever to holders of the Offered Notes in respect of any failure by the Issuer to pay any amounts due under the
Offered Notes.

The ability of the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Offered Notes will be dependent on:

(a) the receipt by it of funds from the Obligors under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;
and

(b) the receipt by it of interest (if any) from monies standing to the credit of the Issuer Transaction
Account, or otherwise from certain Eligible Investments (each as defined below) made by it or on
its behalf.

**_The Class B Notes are subordinated to the Class A Notes and rank behind the Class A Notes as to payment and_**
**_security._**

Pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, payments to be made to the Class B Noteholders
in respect of principal and interest in relation to the Class B Notes, including the Class B6 Notes, will be subordinated
to payments in respect of the Class A Notes in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payments. The Obligors
will not permitted to pay interest due and payable on Class B Loans and subsequently the Issuer will not be able to
make payments on the Class B Notes in the event that the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is no longer satisfied
on any Note Interest Payment Date (unless such payment is made using New Equity Funds received for this purpose).

Furthermore, the Class B Noteholders have limited ability to call a Class B Note Event of Default and a Class
B Loan Event of Default and rank behind the Class A Noteholders in respect of any amounts realised through the
enforcement of security granted under the Issuer Deed of Charge or the Borrower Deed of Charge or the Woburn
Deed of Charge. There is a risk that the proceeds of an enforcement of security at either the Borrowers’ level or the
Issuer level will not be sufficient to meet the Issuer’s payment obligations with respect to the Class B Notes following
the full repayment of its obligations under the Class A Notes. Furthermore, in certain Class A Loan enforcement
scenarios, Class B Loans may be extinguished — see the section “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —
_Intercreditor Agreement”. However, the Class B Notes indirectly benefit from the Topco Payment Undertaking and_
first ranking security under the Topco Share Security — see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —
_Topco Payment Undertaking — Topco Share Security Agreement”._

See “Risks relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency”, “Description of other Indebtedness — Class A
_Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement” and “Description of the Class B6 Loan” for further details._

**_Risks in relation to the proceeds received from the enforcement of the Topco Security Documents for the Class B_**
**_Loans and Class B Notes._**

Pursuant to the Topco Payment Undertaking, Topco will undertake to pay or procure the payment of an
amount equal to the aggregate of: (i) the then principal balance of the Class B Loans; (ii) accrued but unpaid interest
outstanding in respect of the Class B Loans, Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon; (iii) any Additional Amounts; and (iv) all other amounts due and payable under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, on the earlier of (A) the date on which any amount under a Class B Loan remains
outstanding at the close of business on the Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date for such Class B Loan and (B) the
date on which Topco receives a valid demand notice from the Borrower Security Trustee following the occurrence of
a Share Enforcement Event and/or a Class B Loan Event of Default. In addition, Topco will grant as security all of its
shares in CP Cayman Limited in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee to hold for the benefit of the Issuer under
the Topco Security Documents. CP Cayman Limited will then grant as security all of its shares in Center Parcs
(Holdings 1) Limited in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee to hold for the benefit of the Issuer under the CP
Cayman Security Agreement.

77


-----

The Borrower Security Trustee on behalf of the Issuer will be entitled to enforce the Topco Security
Documents upon any Share Enforcement Event pursuant to the Transaction Documents. Such enforcement by the
Borrower Security Trustee will not constitute either a Class A Note Event of Default, or a Class B Note Event of
Default. If, for example, upon the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event, the Borrower Security Trustee enforces
the Topco Security Documents, the Obligor Group could be owned by a different entity. Any such change in ownership
of the Obligor Group would not constitute a change of control under the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements but may
have an adverse effect on the business and administration of Center Parcs and may affect the Borrowers’ ability to
make repayments on the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements when they fall due and as such affect the ability of the
Issuer to repay both the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes.

If a Share Enforcement Event has occurred and is continuing only the Class B Instructing Group (acting upon
a resolution passed by the holders representing at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Class
B Notes then outstanding) may direct the Issuer Security Trustee to require the Borrower Security Trustee to enforce
the Topco Security. There can be no guarantee that the interests of different sub-classes of the Class B Notes will be
aligned or that conflicts of interests will not arise between different sub-classes of the Class B Notes in relation to
instructing the Borrower Security Trustee to enforce the Topco Security.

No assurance can be given that the proceeds realised as a result of an enforcement of any Topco Security
Documents will be sufficient to discharge in full the amounts due on the Class B6 Loan and as a result the Class B6
Notes, nor that the holders of the Class B6 Notes will not be adversely affected by such realisation or enforcement.
See “Risks relating to Security, Enforcement and Insolvency”.

**_Center Parcs may not be able to repurchase the Offered Notes upon a Class B Change of Control with respect to a_**
**_series of Offered Notes and it may not be certain that a Class B Change of Control has occurred or will occur. In_**
**_addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Class B6 Notes_**
**_in connection with a tender offer even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting
a “change of control”. Upon a Class B Change of Control under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement with
respect to any Offered Notes, the Borrowers will be required to make an offer to repurchase all the outstanding Offered
Notes of such series at a premium, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. In such a situation,
the Borrowers may not have enough funds to repurchase all of the outstanding Offered Notes. In addition, by virtue
of provisions in the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Obligors may be prohibited from repurchasing the
Offered Notes upon a Class B Change of Control. A Class B Change of Control in this regard may cause disruption
to the Center Parcs Group and may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Class B6 Loan and agreements
governing any future indebtedness. As a result of such events occurring, the Class B6 Loan and any future
indebtedness may be accelerated.

For the purposes of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, a “change of control” will include a
disposition of all or substantially all the assets of Topco and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain
third parties. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be
a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction in fact involves a disposition of “all or substantially all”
the assets of Topco and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Class
B Change of Control has occurred and with respect to the Offered Notes whether Center Parcs will be required to
make an offer to repurchase all the Offered Notes at the price described above. In addition, a Class B Change of
Control with respect to the Offered Notes is only be deemed to have been triggered if, along with the occurrence of a
“change of control”, the current rating of the Offered Notes is downgraded.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Class B6 Notes, if holders of not less than 90 per
cent. in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B6 Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such
Class B6 Notes in such tender offer and a Borrower purchases all of the Class B6 Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such holders, the Borrowers may prepay the remaining principal amount of the Class B6 Loan, in whole,
but not in part, at a price equal to the purchase price offered to holders of the Class B6 Notes pursuant to such tender
offer and the Issuer will be required to apply the proceeds received from such prepayment to redeem a corresponding
principal amount of Class B6 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional amounts, if any, at a redemption price corresponding to the
prepayment price. See ““Description of the Class B6 Loan—Prepayment—Optional Prepayment”.

**_The holders of the Offered Notes will rank behind certain third parties in respect of certain obligations of the Issuer_**
**_and the Borrowers._**

Although the Issuer Security Trustee will hold the benefit of the Issuer Security on trust for the holders of
the Offered Notes and the Borrower Security Trustee will hold the benefit of the Borrower Security on trust for the
Borrower Secured Creditors, such security interests will also be held on trust for certain third parties. Certain
obligations of the Issuer to third parties will rank ahead of the holders of the Offered Notes. Such persons include,
among others, the Class B Note Trustee (in its individual capacity), the Class A Note Trustee (in its individual
capacity), the Issuer Security Trustee (in its individual capacity), the Liquidity Facility Providers, the Paying Agents
and the Issuer Account Bank in respect of certain amounts owed to them. To the extent that significant amounts are
owing to any such persons, the amounts available to the holders of the Offered Notes will be reduced. Likewise, certain
of the Borrowers’ obligations to certain third parties will rank ahead of their obligations to the Issuer.

In addition, unsecured creditors of the Borrowers, such as trade creditors and suppliers, while subordinate to
the Borrower Secured Creditors, are not bound into the financing structure as they are not parties to the Borrower
Deed of Charge and the Woburn Deed of Charge and so will be able to proceed directly against each of the Borrowers
where they fail to pay any unsecured debts as they fall due. For a more detailed description of the Priorities of Payments
by the Issuer and by the Borrowers both prior and subsequent to the enforcement of the security thereunder, see
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Issuer Deed of Charge” and “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement”._

**_The Issuer is dependent on third parties for the provision of certain services in relation to the Offered Notes._**

The Issuer is a party to contracts with a number of third parties who have agreed to perform certain services
in relation to, among other things, the Offered Notes. For example, the Issuer English Corporate Services Provider
and the Issuer Jersey Corporate Services Provider have agreed to provide various corporate services to the Issuer and
to the Issuer Parent, and the Cash Manager, the Issuer Account Banks and the Paying Agents have agreed to provide,
among other things, payment, administration and calculation services in connection with the Offered Notes. In the
event that any relevant third party fails to perform its obligations under the respective agreements to which it is a party,
the holders of the Offered Notes may be adversely affected.

**_The interests of Center Parcs’ principal shareholder may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Offered_**
**_Notes._**

The interests of Center Parcs’ principal shareholder, in certain circumstances, may conflict with the interests
of the holders of the Offered Notes. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Brookfield Funds own
approximately 99% of Center Parcs’ shares and certain employees and members of management own the remainder.
See “Principal Shareholder”. As a result, the Brookfield Funds have, directly or indirectly, the power, among other
things, to affect Center Parcs’ legal and capital structure and Center Parcs’ day-to-day operations, as well as the ability
to elect and change Center Parcs’ management and board of directors and to approve any other changes to Center
Parcs’ operations. For example, the Brookfield Funds could decide to cause Center Parcs to incur additional
indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The interests of the Borrowers’ ultimate shareholders could
conflict with the holders of the Offered Notes’ interests, particularly if they encounter financial difficulties or are
unable to pay their debts when due. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase Center Parcs’ debt
service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce Center Parcs’ ability to generate revenue, each of which
could adversely affect holders of the Offered Notes.

**_There may be conflicts of interest between the holders of the different classes of the Notes and the Issuer may not_**
**_be able to repay the Offered Notes._**

The Class B Note Trustee will be required to have regard only to the interest of the holders of existing Class
B Notes and new Class B Notes issued after the Seventh Closing Date as if they formed a single class with existing
Class B Notes when exercising his powers, trusts, authorities, duties and discretions (except in certain circumstances
as set out in the Note Trust Deed). Holders of each class of Notes may find their voting powers diluted by the creation
of new Notes and/or any further Notes.

The Class A Noteholders and Class B Noteholders each indirectly benefit from the covenant package given
by the Obligors in relation to each of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement. Each of the Class A Noteholders and/or Class B Noteholders may waive any breach of covenant

79


-----

specific to those covenants given in their respective Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement without the consent of the
alternate class of Noteholders. There is a risk therefore that the Class A Noteholders may waive or amend the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement without regard to the consequences for the holders of the Offered Notes.
Additionally, where new Class A Notes and/or Further Class A Notes are issued, there is an increased risk that the
Offered Notes may not be fully repaid by the Issuer.

**_The Class A Note Trustee may modify certain provisions of, or otherwise make decisions with respect to the Offered_**
**_Notes without consent of the holders of the Offered Notes._**

The Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee)
will be entitled to agree, without the consent of the relevant Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders and any
other Issuer Secured Creditors, with the Issuer and any other relevant party to any of the Issuer Transaction Documents
in making any modification to the Class A Conditions, the Class B Conditions, the Note Trust Deed (other than (in
the case of (c) and (d) below) in respect of either a Class A Basic Terms Modification or a Class B Basic Terms
Modification), the Class B4 Notes, the Class B5 Notes, the Class B6 Notes, or any other Issuer Transaction Documents
to which it is a party or over which it has security, or may give its consent to any event, matter or thing, if:

(a) in its opinion, the interest of the Class A Noteholders would not be materially prejudiced thereby;
or

(b) in its opinion, such modification is required to correct a manifest error or is of a formal, minor,
administrative, or technical nature or one in respect of which the English court could reasonably be
expected to make a rectification order; or

(c) to the extent such event, matter or thing relates to an Entrenched Right and in its opinion, such
modification is required to correct a manifest error or is of a formal, minor, administrative or
technical nature; or

(d) it is required or permitted, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions, under the terms of the
Class A Conditions, the Class B Conditions or the Issuer Transaction Documents provided such
conditions are satisfied.

The Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee)
shall be entitled to determine, in its own opinion, for the purposes of exercising any right, power, trust, authority, duty
or decision under or in relation to the Class A Notes (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class
B Note Trustee in relation to the Offered Notes), the Class A Conditions (or following the full redemption of the
Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee in relation to the Class B Conditions) or any of the Issuer Transaction
Documents, that such exercise will not be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class A Noteholders (or
following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the holders of Class B4 Notes, Class B5 Notes, and/or Class B6
Notes, as applicable) or any relevant class thereof and in making such a determination shall be entitled to take into
account, amongst any other things it may consider necessary and/or appropriate in its absolute discretion, any
confirmation by the Rating Agencies (if available) that the then current rating of the Class A Notes (or following the
full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B4 Notes, Class B5 Notes, and/or the Class B6 Notes, as applicable),
or as the case may be, the relevant class thereof will not be downgraded, withdrawn or qualified, and that, where any
original rating of the Class A Notes (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B4 Notes, Class
B5 Notes, and/or the Class B6 Notes, as applicable) has been and continues to be downgraded, restoration of such
original rating would not be prevented, as a result of such exercise. For the avoidance of doubt, such rating
confirmation or non-receipt of such rating confirmation shall, however, not be construed to mean that any such action
or inaction (or contemplated action or inaction) or such exercise (or contemplated exercise) by the Class A Note
Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee) of any relevant right, power,
trust, authority, duty or decision under or in relation to the Class A Notes (or following the full redemption of the
Class A Notes, Class B4 Notes, Class B5 Notes, and/or the Class B6 Notes, as applicable), the Class A Conditions (or
following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Conditions) or any other Issuer Transaction Documents
is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the Class A Notes or, as the case may be, that Class of
Notes and the non-receipt of such ratings confirmation shall not be construed to mean that such exercise by the Class A
Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee) as aforesaid is
materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class A Noteholders or, as the case may be, the Notes of the relevant
Class.

80


-----

The Class A Note Trustee (or following the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Note Trustee)
may, without the consent or sanction of the Class A Noteholders, the holders of the Offered Notes or any other Issuer
Secured Creditors, authorise or waive any proposed breach of the covenants or provisions contained in the Note Trust
Deed, the Class A Notes, the Offered Notes, or any other Issuer Transaction Documents or determine that a Class A
Note Event of Default and/or a Class B Note Event of Default shall be treated as such if certain conditions are satisfied.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness — Class A Notes” and “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes”.

**_The Issuer Security Trustee and the Borrower Security Trustee may modify certain provisions of, or otherwise_**
**_make decisions with respect to the Issuer Transaction Document and the Borrower Transaction Document without_**
**_consent of the holders of the Offered Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that in connection with the accession of any Additional Site and
issue of any additional Notes or making any additional loans, any consequential amendments, consents or waivers
required to be made or granted pursuant to any Transaction Document to give effect to such transaction or transactions
will not (a) constitute an Entrenched Right and so not require the consent of any Affected Secured Creditor (and such
Affected Secured Creditor may be any of the holders of the Offered Notes) to effect such changes and (b) will not
constitute a General Matter and so will not require the consent of the relevant Instructing Group (and such relevant
Instructing Group may be any of the holders of the Offered Notes) to effect such changes. The Issuer Security Trustee
and the Borrower Security Trustee will be authorised to execute any documents and to give effect to such changes
without incurring any liability for doing so.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Borrower Security Trustee in respect of a Borrower
Transaction Document and the Issuer Security Trustee in respect of an Issuer Transaction Document may approve an
amendment, waiver or consent in respect of such document if it is of the opinion that the relevant action is formal,
minor, administrative or technical, or one in respect of which the English court could reasonably be expected to make
a rectification order (“Relevant Action”). In such circumstances, such Relevant Action may be taken without the
consent of the holders of the Offered Notes, the Issuer Secured Creditors or the Borrower Secured Creditors. The
Relevant Action may be taken in respect of an Entrenched Right.

The Issuer Security Trustee, Borrower Security Trustee, the Class A Note Trustee and Class B Note Trustee
will each not liable for the failure by the Clearing Systems to deliver notices to holders of the Offered Notes in a timely
manner.

In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and certain other Transaction Documents, the Issuer
Security Trustee and the Borrower Security Trustee will have various powers, authorities and discretions to agree to
amendments to certain provisions and to the taking of certain steps by the Obligors without the consent of the Borrower
Secured Creditors or the Issuer Secured Creditors (as applicable). See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement — Amendments, Consents and Waivers — General Procedures”._

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer Security
Trustee may concur with the Obligor Group Agent in making any amendment to give any consent under, or grant any
waiver in respect of, any breach or proposed breach which is not, in the opinion of the Borrower Security Trustee,
materially prejudicial to the interests of the Borrower Secured Creditors, or in the opinion of the Issuer Security Trustee
(as applicable) is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Issuer Secured Creditors (and in the case of any
holders of the Offered Notes in their capacity as Issuer Secured Creditors, where the Class B Note Trustee is of the
opinion that the relevant amendment, consent or waiver is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders of
the Offered Notes).

**_Holders of the Class B6 Notes will have recourse to any additional villages that Center Parcs constructs or acquires_**
**_in the United Kingdom only if and when certain conditions under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement_**
**_are satisfied following completion of the development of such additional villages. These conditions may not be_**
**_satisfied when expected, or at all._**

The revenues derived from any additional village that Center Parcs constructs or acquires in the United
Kingdom will not benefit the Restricted Group unless and until certain conditions in the Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreements that allow accession of additional sites to the Restricted Group are satisfied and the formal accession
process is completed. Furthermore, the Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements will allow the Obligors, subject to various
conditions, to raise further debt in the form of additional loans to fund the accession of additional sites to the Obligor
Group.

81


-----

The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement provides that the Borrowers must use all reasonable
endeavours to procure the accession of the relevant additional village site in the United Kingdom within three years
of either the acquisition of the relevant additional village or the additional village becoming operational and starting
to receive paying guests, whichever is later. The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement further provides (among
other things) that if the market conditions are such that the accession of the relevant additional village to the Obligor
Group would not be executable in a “commercially reasonable manner (having regard to the then expected pricing for
such acquisition)” then the Borrowers will not be required to procure accession at that time but as soon as possible
after that time. See “Description of Other Indebtedness — Class A IBLA — Additional Site Entities”.

While the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will not require the satisfaction of similar conditions,
so long as the Class A Notes are outstanding, the holders of the Class B6 Notes will not have recourse to any additional
villages in the United Kingdom unless the conditions under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement are satisfied.
Accordingly, unless and until the accession conditions are satisfied and any relevant additional village located in the
United Kingdom is transferred to the Obligor Group in accordance with the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,
the business that supports interest and principal on the Notes may be negatively impacted by any such additional
village without receiving any benefits or income expected to be derived from the additional village. Accordingly,
development and operation of any additional village in the United Kingdom may materially and adversely affect the
Obligors’ financial condition, results of operations and the Obligors’ ability to pay interest and principal on the Notes.

In addition, none of the Obligors will own assets relating to, or derive revenues from, Longford Forest or any
other additional village outside the United Kingdom. Holders of the Class B6 Notes will not have recourse to any such
village outside the United Kingdom, its assets, revenues or cash flow. See “—Holders of the Class B Notes will not
_have recourse to any additional village outside the United Kingdom, its assets, revenues or cash flow. Development_
_of any such village may divert management’s time from villages in the United Kingdom.”_

**_Regulatory initiatives may result in increased regulatory capital requirements and/or decreased liquidity in respect_**
**_of the Offered Notes._**

In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there has been increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the assetbacked securities industry in recent years. This has resulted in numerous measures for increased regulation which are
currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge
to certain investors in certain securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to invest in securities
issued under such structures, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.

Holders of the Offered Notes should consult their own advisers as to the consequences to, and effect on, them
of the application of Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (together “CRD”), Regulation (EU)
No. 231/2013 (the “AIFM Regulation”) and Article 254 of Regulation (EU) No. 35/2015 (the “Solvency II
**Regulation”), each as implemented by their own regulator, to their holding of any Class B6 Notes. The Issuer will**
not responsible for informing holders of the Offered Notes of the effects of the changes to risk-weighting which will
result for investors from the adoption of CRD, the AIFM Regulation and the Solvency II Regulation by their own
regulator.

**_The Offered Notes will be new securities for which there is no established trading market._**

The Offered Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no market. The Class B Global
Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners may make a market in the Offered Notes as permitted by applicable laws and
regulations; however, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners are not obligated to make a market in
the Offered Notes and they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore,
Center Parcs cannot assure any investor as to the development or liquidity of any trading market for the Offered Notes.
The liquidity of any market for the Offered Notes will depend on a number of factors, including:

    - the number of holders of the Offered Notes;

    - the operating performance and financial condition of Center Parcs;

    - the market for similar securities;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Offered Notes; and

    - prevailing interest rates.

82


-----

Historically, the debt capital markets have been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility
in the prices of securities similar to the Offered Notes. Center Parcs cannot assure investors that the market, if any,
for the Offered Notes will be free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect the
prices at which the investors may sell the Offered Notes. Therefore, Center Parcs cannot assure investors that they
will be able to sell the Offered Notes at a particular time nor that the Offered Notes will receive a favourable price
from such sale. Consequently, investors in the Offered Notes should be aware that they may have to hold the Offered
Notes until their maturity.

In addition, the market value of the Offered Notes may fluctuate with changes in prevailing rates of interest,
market perceptions of the risks associated with the Offered Notes, supply and other market conditions. Consequently,
any sale of Offered Notes by the holders of the Offered Notes in any secondary market which may develop may be at
a discount to the original purchase price of such Offered Notes.

**_Rating Agency assessments, downgrades and changes to Rating Agencies’ criteria may result in ratings volatility_**
**_on the Offered Notes, including as a result of the effect of COVID-19 on past and future performance, or may not_**
**_reflect all the risks associated with an investment in the Offered Notes._**

The ratings assigned to the Offered Notes by S&P and Fitch address the likelihood of full and timely payment
to the holders of the Offered Notes of all payments of interest due on each Note Interest Payment Date and the full
repayment of principal of the Offered Notes on or before the relevant final maturity date. There is no assurance that
any such ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be reviewed, revised, suspended or withdrawn
entirely by the Rating Agencies as a result of changes in or unavailability of information or if, in the Rating Agencies’
judgement, circumstances so warrant. Rating organisations other than the Rating Agencies could seek to rate the
Offered Notes and, if such “unsolicited ratings” are lower than the comparable rating assigned to the Offered Notes
by the Rating Agencies, such “shadow ratings” could have an adverse effect on the value of the Offered Notes.

Furthermore, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, although Fitch affirmed the Issuer’s credit rating on
18 June 2020 and S&P affirmed the BBB credit rating of the Issuer’s Class A Notes on 16 July 2020, the credit rating
of the Issuer’s Class B Notes was downgraded to B- on 16 July 2020 by S&P. See“—Risks Relating to Center Parcs’
_Business and Industry—_ _The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect_
_Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations.”_

In addition, future events, including events affecting Center Parcs, could have an adverse impact on the
ratings of the Offered Notes (as to which, see “— Risks Relating to the Financing Structure — Sale of a Propco may
_have an adverse effect on the ability of the Borrowers to meet their obligations under the Loans and ultimately affect_
_the repayments on the Notes by the Issuer”.)_

Where a particular matter (including the determination of material prejudice by the Class B Note Trustee)
involves each of S&P and Fitch being requested to confirm that a proposed action would not result, in the case of
S&P, in a downgrade or a CreditWatch placement, or in the case of Fitch, in the downgrade of the then current rating
of the Offered Notes, such confirmation is given at the sole discretion of the relevant Rating Agency. Depending on
the timing of delivery of the request and any relevant information, there is a risk that the relevant Rating Agency
cannot provide its confirmation in the time available or at all. No Rating Agency will be responsible for the
consequences of any failure to deliver a Ratings Assessment or confirmation on any particular timescale.

Confirmation, if given, will be given on the basis of the facts and circumstances prevailing at the relevant
time, and in the context of cumulative changes to the transaction of which the Offered Notes form part since the
Seventh Closing Date. A confirmation of ratings represents only a restatement of the opinions given at the Seventh
Closing Date, and cannot be construed as advice for the benefit of any parties to the transaction or as confirmation
that an event or amendment is in the best interest of, or not materially prejudicial to the interests of, the holders of the
Offered Notes. No assurance can be given that a requirement to seek a ratings confirmation will not have a subsequent
impact upon the business of the Issuer.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Issuer Security Trustee, Borrower Security
Trustee, the Class A Note Trustee and the Class B Note Trustee will acknowledge that they do not have any right of
recourse to or against either Rating Agency in respect of a Ratings Assessment which either the Issuer Security Trustee
or Borrower Security Trustee relies upon.

Reliance by the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee on any Ratings Assessment will not
create, impose on or extend to either Rating Agency any actual or contingent liability to any person (including, without

83


-----

limitation, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee and/or any holders of the Class B6 Notes) or
create any legal relations between Fitch and the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee, the Class A
Global Coordinator and Arranger, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners, any Noteholder or any
other person whether by way of contract or otherwise.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision,
suspension or withdrawal at any time by the assigning Rating Agency. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact
of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value
of the Offered Notes.

In general, European regulated investors are restricted under the CRA Regulation from using credit ratings
for regulatory purposes in the EEA, unless such ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the EEA
and registered under the CRA Regulation (and such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended, subject to
transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances). Such general restriction will also apply in the case of credit
ratings issued by third country non-EEA credit rating agencies, unless the relevant credit ratings are endorsed by an
EEA-registered credit rating agency or the relevant third country rating agency is certified in accordance with the
CRA Regulation (and such endorsement action or certification, as the case may be, has not been withdrawn or
suspended, subject to transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances). The list of registered and certified
rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) on its website in accordance
with the CRA Regulation is not conclusive evidence of the status of the relevant rating agency included in such list,
as there may be delays between certain supervisory measures being taken against a relevant rating agency and the
publication of the updated ESMA list.

Investors regulated in the UK are subject to similar restrictions under the UK CRA Regulation. As such, UK
regulated investors are required to use for UK regulatory purposes ratings issued by a credit rating agency established
in the UK and registered under the UK CRA Regulation. In the case of ratings issued by third country non-UK credit
rating agencies, third country credit ratings can either be: (a) endorsed by a UK registered credit rating agency; or (b)
issued by a third country credit rating agency that is certified in accordance with the UK CRA Regulation. Note this
is subject, in each case, to (a) the relevant UK registration, certification or endorsement, as the case may be, not having
been withdrawn or suspended, and (b) transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances. In the case of third
country ratings, for a certain limited period of time, transitional relief accommodates continued use for regulatory
purposes in the UK, of existing pre-2021 ratings, provided the relevant conditions are satisfied.

If the status of the rating agency rating the Offered Notes changes for the purposes of the CRA Regulation
or the UK CRA Regulation, relevant regulated investors may no longer be able to use the rating for regulatory purposes
in the EEA or the UK, as applicable, and the Offered Notes may have a different regulatory treatment, which may
impact the value of the Offered Notes and their liquidity in the secondary market. Certain information with respect to
the credit rating agencies and ratings is set out on the cover of this Offering Memorandum.

In respect of a disposal of a Propco or a holiday park owned by a Propco made pursuant to the Class A
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, a Ratings Assessment is required to be obtained from each of S&P and Fitch. If
either Rating Agency delivers such a Ratings Assessment, such Ratings Assessment will be prepared and delivered
by either Rating Agency on the following limited basis:

(b) a Ratings Assessment will be a point-in-time assessment which:

(i) will not constitute a credit rating by either Rating Agency;

(ii) will not be monitored by either Rating Agency and therefore will not be updated to reflect
changed circumstances or information that may affect the Ratings Assessment; and

(iii) will not address other matters that may be of relevance to the Noteholders,

and such Ratings Assessment will be issued on the basis that the Issuer Security Trustee, the
Borrower Security Trustee and each Noteholder will be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed
to the above terms;

84


-----

(c) none of the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee or any Noteholder will have any
right of recourse to or against either Rating Agency in respect of a Ratings Assessment which is
relied upon by the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee; and

(d) reliance by the Issuer Security Trustee or the Borrower Security Trustee on any Ratings Assessment
will not create, impose on or extend to either Rating Agency any actual or contingent liability to any
person (including, without limitation, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee
and/or any Noteholder) or create any legal relations between either Rating Agency and the Issuer
Security Trustee, the Borrower Security Trustee, the Class A Global Coordinator and Arranger, the
Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners, any Noteholder or any other person whether
by way of contract or otherwise.

**_Definitive Notes not having denominations in integral multiples of the minimum authorised denomination may_**
**_have difficulty in trading in the secondary market._**

The Offered Notes have a denomination consisting of a minimum authorised denomination of £100,000 plus
higher integral multiples of £1,000 up to £199,000. Accordingly, it is possible that the Offered Notes may be traded
in amounts in excess of the minimum authorised denomination that are not integral multiples of such denomination.
In such a case, if Definitive Notes are required to be issued, a Noteholder of the Offered Notes who holds a principal
amount less than the minimum authorised denomination at the relevant time may not receive a Definitive Note in
respect of such holding and may need to purchase a principal amount of Offered Notes such that their holding amounts
to the minimum authorised denomination (or another relevant denomination amount).

If Definitive Notes are issued, holders of the Offered Notes should be aware that Definitive Notes which have
a denomination that is not an integral multiple of the minimum authorised denomination may be illiquid and difficult
to trade.

**_Offered Notes in book-entry form are subject to the rules of Euroclear and Clearstream, respectively, which may_**
**_not be adequate to ensure the owners their timely exercise of rights under the Offered Notes._**

The Offered Notes will initially only be issued in global form and deposited with a common depository for
Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests in the Global Note trade in book-entry form only. The common depository, or its
nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream, is the sole holder of the Global Note. Accordingly, owners of book-entry
interests must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, and non-participants in Euroclear
or Clearstream, Luxembourg, must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interests,
to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Offered Notes.

Unlike the holders of the Offered Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct
right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Offered
Notes. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, may not be adequate to
ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Offered Notes.

**_Prepayment of the Class B6 Loan may negatively affect the projected yield to maturity of the Offered Notes._**

The yield to maturity of the Offered Notes will depend on, amongst other things, the amount and timing of
repayment and prepayment of principal on the Class B6 Loan and the price paid by the holders of the Offered Notes.
Such yield may be adversely affected by a higher or lower than anticipated rate of prepayment on the Class B6 Loan.
The rate of prepayment of the Class B6 Loan cannot be predicted and will be influenced by a wide variety of economic
and other factors, including prevailing interest rates, the buoyancy of the UK holiday centre market, the availability
of alternative financing and local and regional economic conditions. Therefore, no assurance can be given as to the
level of prepayment that will be experienced. In addition, Topco will be required to immediately repay all of the Class
B Loans (including the Class B6 Loan) in the event that (1) any Class B Loan remains outstanding at the close of
business on the Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date for such Class B Loan or (2) Topco receives a valid demand
notice from the Borrower Security Trustee following the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event and/or a Class B
Loan Event of Default. The Class B4 Loan Expected Maturity Date and the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date
each occur prior to the Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date and therefore failure by the Borrowers to repay the
Class B4 Loan or Class B5 Loan on or prior to such dates may result in enforcement of the Topco Payment
Undertaking and the Topco Security Documents which in turn may result in the Class B6 Loan being repaid prior to
the Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date.

85


-----

**_Changes of law may have a negative impact on the ability of the Issuer to meet its payment obligations under the_**
**_Offered Notes._**

The transactions described in this Offering Memorandum (including the issuance of the Offered Notes) and
the ratings assigned to the Offered Notes are based on the relevant law and administrative practice in effect as at the
date hereof, and having regard to the expected tax treatment of all relevant entities under such law and practice. It is
possible that, whether as a result of case law or through statute, changes in law or regulations, or their interpretation
or application, or administrative practice or tax treatment after the date of this Offering Memorandum, may result in
either the Issuer’s, Center Parcs’ or the Obligor Group’s debt financing arrangements as originally structured no longer
having the effect anticipated or which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s, Center Parcs’ or the Obligor
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations and/or could adversely affect the rights, priorities of
payments and/or treatment of holdings in Class B6 Notes of the holders of the Offered Notes.

**_The Offered Notes will be subject to restrictions on transfer, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price_**
**_at which they may be sold._**

The Offered Notes have not been, nor will they be, registered under the securities laws of the United States
or elsewhere. The Offered Notes may not be publicly offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred in any jurisdiction
where registration may be required. In particular, sales and transfers of the Offered Notes are subject to restrictions
and/or certification requirements under the Securities Act as set forth in more detail under “Notice to Investors and
_Transfer Restrictions.” These restrictions may limit your ability to resell the Offered Notes. You should inform_
yourself of, and seek legal advice in relation to, applicable securities laws.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The estimated gross proceeds from the issuance of the Offered Notes will be £255,000,000.

Subject to the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer intends to make available to
the Borrowers on the Seventh Closing Date the Class B6 Facility and the Class B6 Loan will be advanced under the
Class B6 Facility.

On the Seventh Closing Date, the Borrowers and the Issuer intend to use £250,000,000 of the proceeds of the
Class B6 Loan to refinance the Class B3 Loan by prepaying a corresponding portion of the principal amount
outstanding under the Class B3 Loan so as to enable a redemption by the Issuer of a corresponding portion of the Class
B3 Notes (but not including the payment of any prepayment premium and accrued and unpaid interest). The remaining
£5,000,000 of the proceeds of the Class B6 Loan will be applied to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the
Transactions, including the prepayment premium.

On or about the Seventh Closing Date, the Issuer will redeem the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
£250,000,000 of the Class B3 Notes at a redemption price of 101.063% of the principal amount of such Class B3
Notes redeemed, which is the redemption price applicable to the Class B3 Notes on or after 28 August 2020 but prior
to 28 August 2021. Proceeds of the Class B6 Loan in the amount of £250,000,000 will be used to prepay a
corresponding portion of the principal amount of the Class B3 Loan (but not including any prepayment premium and
accrued and unpaid interest) so as to enable a redemption by the Issuer of a corresponding portion of the Class B3
Notes. The payment of the prepayment premium will be made from the remaining proceeds of the Class B6 Loan. The
payment of the accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of prepayment will be funded from other funds available to
the Borrowers. The Issuer will apply the proceeds of such prepayment to redeem the Class B3 Notes in full on or
about the Seventh Closing Date. The following table describes the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection
with the Transactions as at the Seventh Closing Date. The actual amounts as compared with those set forth in the table
and in the accompanying footnotes are subject to adjustments and may differ at the date of completion of the
Transactions depending on several factors, including differences from the estimation of fees and expenses.

This table should be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial Information”, “Selected
_Consolidated Financial Information”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results_
_of Operations”, and Center Parcs’ audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in_
this Offering Memorandum.

(1) As adjusted cash and cash equivalents does not reflect the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Class B3 Notes expected to be
redeemed on or about the Seventh Closing Date, assuming £250,000,000 of Class B3 Notes are redeemed. As at April 15, 2021, cash
on balance sheet at the bank was £79.4 million.

(2) The amounts of the Class A2 Facility, Class A4 Facility, Class A5 Facility, Class B3 Facility, Class B4 Facility, Class B5 Facility and
Class B6 Facility do not reflect unamortised deferred issue costs and also do not reflect accrued and unpaid interest, any prepayment
fees or other charges expected to be owed under such facilities. The amount shown for the Class A4 Facility includes £7.9 million of
issue premium.

(3) A prepayment premium of approximately £2.7 million in relation to the Class B3 Facility is due as part of the Transactions, provided
£250,000,000 of the proceeds of the Class B6 Loan are used to repay a corresponding portion of the Class B3 Loan and redeem a
corresponding part of the Class B3 Notes on or about the Seventh Closing Date at a redemption price of 101.063% of the principal
amount of Class B3 Notes redeemed.

(4) Unamortised deferred issue costs represent unamortised financing transaction costs to be recognised in the income statement over the
remaining period of the borrowing using the effective interest method. The increase in unamortised deferred issue costs of £1.4 million
represents the estimated fees and expenses of £2.3 million associated with the Transactions minus write-off of unamortised deferred
issue costs of £0.9 million as at 31 December 2020 related to the Class B3 Facility.

(5) On the Second Issue Date, the Issuer entered into the Liquidity Facility Agreement in order to enable the Issuer to service interest due
on the Class A Notes in the event of insufficient funds being received from the Obligors under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement to ensure that the Issuer meets its interest payments due to the Class A Noteholders. As at 31 December 2020, the total
commitments under the Liquidity Facility were £90.0 million. The Liquidity Facility is expected to be undrawn as at the Seventh Closing
Date.

(6) Total third party debt as adjusted for the Transactions does not include £70 million received on 14 July 2020 under the Intercompany
Account Advance. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions —Intercompany Account Agreement.”

(7) The decrease in total equity reflects the write-off of £0.9 million (as at 31 December 2020) of unamortised deferred issue costs and a
£2.7 million prepayment premium (as at 31 December 2020) related to the Class B3 Facility, in each case in connection with the
Transactions.

(8) Total capitalisation is defined as the sum of total third party debt and total equity.

**SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

_This discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based on, and should be read in conjunction_
_with, (i) the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited as at_
_and for each of the 52-week periods ended 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019, and the 53-week period ended 26 April_
_2018, each as included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and (ii) the Interim Financial Information_
_incorporated by reference into this Offering Memorandum. The audit reports, included elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum, express an unqualified opinion for each of the respective audited periods and the audit report in_
_relation to the financial statements as at and for the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020 includes a material_
_uncertainty paragraph related to going concern as set forth in Note 1 to such financial statements. The financial_
_information as at 26 April 2018 has been derived from the comparative period included in the audited consolidated_
_financial statements as at and for the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019. The Interim Financial Information as at_
_and for the 36-week periods ended 31 December 2020 and 2 January 2020 has not been prepared in accordance with_
_IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and has not been audited or reviewed. The selected historical financial_
_information set forth below should be read in conjunction with Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited’s consolidated_
_financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and the sections entitled_
_“Presentation of Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations”. The information below is not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited early adopted IFRS 16 in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and_
_recognised £2.2 million as a reduction in retained earnings as a result of the adoption. Center Parcs (Holdings 1)_
_Limited early adopted IFRS 16 by applying the modified retrospective approach, which requires the cumulative effect_
_of the initial application of IFRS 16 to be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on_
_27 April 2018, the date of initial application, without restating prior periods. On adoption, right of use assets and_
_lease liabilities were brought onto the balance sheet for £30.9 million and £33.1 million, respectively, and related_
_depreciation charges and finance expense are recognised in the income statement, instead of operating lease rentals_
_expenses._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 15 in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 using_
_the retrospective method and restating the comparative periods. The effect of adoption of IFRS 15 as at 20 April 2017_
_was the deferral of £0.8 million of revenue in respect of certain promotional activities that was recognised as a liability_
_at the transition date with a corresponding reduction to retained earnings._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 9 in the 52 weeks period ended 25 April 2019 and in_
_accordance with the standard, the comparative periods were not restated. The adoption of IFRS 9 on 27 April 2018_
_did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited._

_As a result of the adoption of the above accounting standards, the audited consolidated financial statements_
_as at and for each of the 52-week periods ended 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 are not directly comparable with_
_the audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018, included in this_
_Offering Memorandum. The audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the 53-week period ended 26 April_
_2018 were prepared in accordance with IAS 18, Revenue, IAS 17, Leases and IAS 39, Financial Instruments:_
_Recognition and Measurement, which were the standards applicable at that time._

(2) Exceptional and non-underlying items represented exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses of £2.2 million for the financial year
ended 23 April 2020, comprised of £2.0 million in costs to exit a contract and £0.2 million of legal and other associated costs relating to the
equity contribution provided by the Brookfield Funds. Exceptional and non-underlying items for the financial year ended 26 April 2018
represented exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses of £1.6 million of costs relating to legal health and safety claims at Woburn
Forest and associated settlements, together with £0.7 million of one-off restructuring and reorganisation costs.

(3) Exceptional and non-underlying finance expense for the 36 weeks ended 31 December 2020 represents fees incurred to obtain a waiver of the
covenants on the Group’s secured debt. Exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 represented
the £6.1 million premium paid on the settlement of Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes and £1.6 million in accelerated amortization of deferred issue
costs in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes. Exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses for the financial year
ended 26 April 2018 represented the £26.9 million premium paid on the settlement of Center Parcs’ Class B2 Notes.

(4) Exceptional and non-underlying taxation expense for the financial year ended 23 April 2020 represented the impact of the change in the
applicable deferred tax rate from 17% to 19%, which was partially offset by a taxation credit related to exceptional and non-underlying
administrative expenses. Exceptional and non-underlying taxation income for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 represented a
£1.5 million tax credit related to break costs and the accelerated write-off of deferred fees in connection with the redemption of Center
Parcs’ Class A3 Notes. Exceptional and non-underlying taxation income for the financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented a
£5.3 million tax credit in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class B3 Notes and a £1.9 million tax credit in respect of a
one-off adjustment to group relief relating to restricted interest deductions and subsequent increased capital allowances claims.

(1) Center Parcs adopted IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ starting on 27 April 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Center Parcs recognises a
right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term
leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, Center Parcs recognises
the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**

**OPERATIONS**

_This discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based on, and should be read in conjunction_
_with, (i) the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited as at_
_and for each of the 52-week periods ended 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019, and the 53-week period ended 26 April_
_2018, in each case included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, and (ii) the Interim Financial Information_
_incorporated by reference into this Offering Memorandum. The audit reports, included elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum, express an unqualified opinion for each of the respective audited periods and the audit report in_
_relation to the financial statements as at and for the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020 includes a material_
_uncertainty paragraph related to going concern as set forth in Note 1 to such financial statements. The financial_
_information as at and for the 52-week period ended 26 April 2018 has been derived from the comparative period_
_included in the audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019. The_
_Interim Financial Information as at and for the 36-week periods ended 31 December 2020 and 2 January 2020 has_
_not been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and has not been audited or reviewed. See_
_also “Selected Consolidated Financial Information” and “Presentation of Financial Information”._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited early adopted IFRS 16 in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and_
_recognised £2.2 million as a reduction in retained earnings as a result of the adoption. Center Parcs (Holdings 1)_
_Limited early adopted IFRS 16 by applying the modified retrospective approach, which requires the cumulative effect_
_of the initial application of IFRS 16 to be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on_
_27 April 2018, the date of initial application, without restating prior periods. On adoption, right of use assets and_
_lease liabilities were brought onto the balance sheet for £30.9 million and £33.1 million, respectively, and related_
_depreciation charges and finance expense are recognised in the income statement, instead of operating lease rentals_
_expenses._

_Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited also adopted IFRS 15 in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 using_

**Overview**

Center Parcs is a leading UK short-break holiday business, attracting over 2.1 million guests in the 52-week
period ended 27 February 2020. Center Parcs operates five specially constructed holiday villages in the United
Kingdom: Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Elveden Forest in Suffolk, Whinfell
Forest in Cumbria (the “Original Villages”) and Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire. Each village is set in a forest
environment amongst approximately 400 acres of forest around a lake and is open 365 days per year.

Woodland, water and a natural environment make up the essential environment of a Center Parcs break.
Within this comfortable, quiet, car-free and family-friendly setting, each of the Center Parcs villages provides guests
with high quality accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. In total, as of 31 December 2020, there
were 4,335 units of accommodation across its five villages, which could accommodate approximately 22,958 guests
per day at 100% occupancy. The focal point and key attraction of each village is an all-weather indoor sub-tropical
swimming paradise, featuring a selection of water activities including a wave pool, river slides and rides, children’s
pools and Jacuzzis. Center Parcs’ on-site experiences also include outdoor activities such as cycling, boating and zip
wires; indoor activities such as ten-pin bowling, badminton and pottery; and amenities such as spas, food and beverage
and retail. A significant proportion of Center Parcs’ revenue is generated from guests’ on-site spending, including for
leisure and spa activities, food and beverage and retail, representing 39.2% of total revenue in financial year 2020.

Center Parcs has a well-established brand in the UK, renowned for providing high quality experiences and
facilities, targeting a primary guest base of affluent families. Center Parcs benefits from strong guest loyalty with
approximately 34% of guests returning within 14 months and approximately 54% of guests returning over a five-year
period as of financial year 2020. In addition, Center Parcs believes that its business model is difficult to replicate due
to the lack of suitable locations for the development of holiday parks and high development costs while Center Parcs
is well positioned to continue to grow its business.

Center Parcs’ villages typically draw on a regional population of guests who are attracted to the convenience
of being within a relatively short driving distance from home. Over 90% of the UK population lives within a 2.5 hour
drive of at least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two hour drive of
the village they choose to visit. Center Parcs believes that the proximity of the majority of guests to its villages
combined with the easy accessibility of the villages by car make Center Parcs a popular and convenient short break
holiday option. Occupancy levels at Center Parcs’ villages have been consistently high: 97.6% in financial year 2018,
97.1% in financial year 2019, and 97.3% in the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. Occupancy levels have
averaged approximately 96% in the last 15 years to 27 February 2020, and approximately 97% in the last eight years
to 27 February 2020, despite the expansion of existing accommodation offerings at Center Parcs’ Original Villages
and the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014. However, as a result of village closures and occupancy restrictions in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall occupancy level at Center Parcs’ villages for the 36-week period
ended 31 December 2020 was 30.5%.

For the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, Center Parcs had revenue of £496.3 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of £239.4 million, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.2%.

In each of the financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have been
broadly evenly split amongst Center Parcs’ villages, reflecting both the individual strength of each village and the
diversity of Center Parcs’ asset base.

The map below shows the location of each of Center Parcs’ villages as of 31 December 2020.

With the exception of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have
consistently grown over the past ten years. Total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were £496.3 million and
£239.4 million, respectively, for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. Adjusted EBITDA margins grew from
42.4% in financial year 2008 to 48.2% in the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020.

**Key Factors affecting results of Operations**

**The COVID-19 pandemic**

The COVID-19 pandemic and government efforts to contain it have severely impacted the travel and
hospitality industry in the United Kingdom, including Center Parcs. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Center
Parcs closed all of its villages to guests from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020, 5 November 2020 to 4 December 2020

97


-----

and 21 December 2020 to 11 April 2021. The closure of the villages resulted in no revenue being recorded from
holidays that would have taken place during that period, which included periods such as the Easter holidays (for both
2020 and 2021), May half-term and the Christmas/New Year period which have historically been very profitable.
During the periods the villages were open to guests, they operated with limited capacity and were also subject to
localised closures as a result of the tier restrictions, such as the closure of Sherwood Village from 30 October 2020
and the closure of Woburn Village from 18 December 2020, in both cases until the 12 April 2021 reopening. In
addition, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, all guests impacted by a closure have had the option to change dates
with £100 discount or cancel and claim a full refund. The £100 discount offer has continued to see a high level of
uptake, with over 50% of guests over the course of the most recent lockdown from 21 December 2020 to 11 April
2021 choosing this option rather than cancelling their booking. The refunds to guests amounted to approximately
£146.8 million as of 18 March 2021, which resulted in an adverse impact to Center Parcs’ liquidity and cash flow. As
a result of the closures and additional restrictions during the periods when the villages were open, Center Parcs’
revenue decreased to £114.9 million for the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 as compared to £360.2 million
for the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020. The majority of refunds relating to cancelled breaks have been
processed, and over 50% of guests whose breaks were cancelled as a result of the latest closures took up the offer to
change their arrival date to a later period.

Brookfield has, throughout this period, demonstrated its ongoing support and commitment to Center Parcs’
business. Brookfield (through its subsidiary, BSREP II Center Parcs Jersey Ltd.) supported the Center Parcs Group,
which is one of the largest investments in the BSREP II fund, with equity contributions of £41.5 million in April 2020,
£27.5 million in May 2020 and £51.0 million received in February 2021, as well as the £70 million Intercompany
Account Advance provided on 14 July 2020 to CP Opco, to continue to support Center Parcs during the COVID-19
pandemic. These commitments are part of a total of £230 million of financial support available to Center Parcs that
has been approved by the Brookfield funds, with the balance of £40 million available to Center Parcs and CP Ireland
if required.

During the closure of Center Parcs’ villages, Center Parcs ensured stringent cost controls and implemented
strict cash management procedures to conserve liquidity, including the rephasing of capital investment projects and
cessation of non-essential operating activities. Center Parcs reduced capital expenditure by ceasing and rephasing nonessential capital projects as closures were announced. Center Parcs estimates that approximately 37.5% of its total
capital expenditure has been rephased for financial year 2021. In addition, Center Parcs also participated in a number
of UK government support measures for businesses to reduce the impact of the closures on its liquidity. Center Parcs
deferred VAT payments and furloughed up to 90% of its employees during the Closure Periods in accordance with
the UK government’s CJRS scheme. Center Parcs also utilised the 12-month business rates holiday available to retail,
hospitality and leisure businesses and expects to utilise the further 3-month business rates holiday from April 2021 to
June 2021, and the maximum £2.0 million of business rate relief from July onwards. Together, these actions reduced
operating expenses by approximately £14 million on average per four-week period, or approximately 70%, to
approximately £6 to £7 million on average per four-week period from 24 April 2020 to 18 June 2020 and 21 December
2020 to 25 February 2021, representing a closed period, as compared to approximately £20 million on average per
four-week period from 26 April 2019 to 27 February 2020, representing a typical operating period. Operating expenses
gradually increased in the lead up to the re-opening of the villages on 12 April 2021.

Center Parcs has implemented significant operational changes in accordance with government health and
safety regulations, and has developed a new operating framework to ensure that the government’s guidelines can be
implemented effectively. This framework covers every aspect of Center Parcs’ village operations, including
accommodation, food & beverage, leisure activities, retail and its pools and spas. Center Parcs has also engaged with
industry bodies to influence government guidance demonstrating that Center Parcs is setting the standard for the
leisure industry in a post-COVID-19 environment. Center Parcs’ villages are temporarily operating at reduced capacity
levels appropriate to ensure proper application of government requirements and Center Parcs has implemented an
enhanced cleaning regime throughout the villages. Following the re-opening of Center Parcs’ villages on 12 April
2021, its villages are currently operating at approximately 75% capacity, with gradual increases in capacity planned
up to near full capacity at the end of summer 2021. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, a number of Center
Parcs’ leisure activities remain unavailable to guests. 74% of leisure activities (as measured by the number of activities
Center Parcs is offering) are currently available, and a delivery service is offered for food and beverage offerings, with
some outdoor beverage service available on terraces. The pool areas in Center Parcs’ villages are currently due to
remain closed until 17 May 2021.

98


-----

Center Parcs continues to review and amend its operating procedures, prioritising guest and employee safety.
These operational changes may result in additional operating expenses. In addition, some guests may choose to cancel
their holidays if features and amenities remain closed, which would result in an adverse impact on revenues and cash
flow. Due to the closure of certain features and amenities, Center Parcs currently offers guests the options of a free
change of dates or a full refund for guests who choose to cancel their breaks. Center Parcs has in place a Book with
Confidence Guarantee, giving all guests with an arrival date up to 21 June 2021 the option to reschedule or cancel
with a full refund six weeks before arrival. Guests arriving between 21 June 2021 and 18 April 2022 have the option
to reschedule or cancel with a full refund eleven weeks before arrival. Center Parcs has received excellent guest
feedback, following its management of its closure and re-opening programme during the course of the COVID-19
pandemic. In particular, Center Parcs received strong feedback around its COVID-19-secure operating procedures.

While consumer sentiment on leisure travel in light of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be predicted, Center
Parcs believes it may be relatively well-positioned to benefit from pent-up demand for short breaks and staycations,
particularly in light of the United Kingdom’s strong vaccination campaign. In a recent customer survey of
approximately 4,000 guests on 5 March 2021, only 3% of respondents stated that they did not intend to take a domestic
holiday or short break in the next twelve months. Most guests travel in their own cars to and from the villages, the
lodges provide for self-catering, the spacing between lodges and large open footprint of the villages lends itself well
to social distancing and many of the activities are outdoors, benefiting from the forest environment. In addition,
restrictions on international travel, including in response to high levels of COVID-19 and low vaccination rates in
other countries as well as the threat of new and emerging variants, may further increase demand for Center Parcs’
villages. As of 16 April 2021, bookings for financial year 2022 were 52.1% sold, as compared to 41.6% of bookings
for financial year 2020 as at the same point in April 2019 (and 36.2% in April 2020, which was impacted by COVID19-related cancellations). Historically, at the end of each financial year, approximately 40% of the bookings for Center
Parcs’ villages for the following financial year have been sold. Therefore, the current rate of bookings for financial
year 2022 is ahead of Center Parcs’ historical expectations.

Further, in the first and second lockdown periods from 20 March 2020 to 13 July 2020 and 5 November 2020
to 4 December 2020, approximately 40% of guests who had booked breaks during the period of closure due to COVID19 postponed rather than cancelled their breaks. In the most recent lockdown from December to 11 April 2021,
approximately 50% of guests who had booked breaks postponed rather than cancelled their breaks. However, despite
any resilience in demand in the short term, occupancy and RevPAL are expected to continue to be adversely impacted
as a result of restrictions on capacity.

The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Center Parcs’ business is dependent on several factors,
including the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK’s economic recovery, domestic travel demand,
and evolving customer expectations. Further outbreaks of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom, the spread of further
variants of COVID-19 that are more virulent, infectious or less responsive to vaccines, continuing depressed economic
conditions or travel demand, or new health and safety regulations could also result in an adverse impact on Center
Parcs’ results. In addition, a localised outbreak of COVID-19 at any of Center Parcs’ villages or elsewhere in the UK
could result in further closures, litigation, restrictions on guests’ ability to travel and affect guest and employee
confidence. Center Parcs may not be able to efficiently manage its operating expenses and liquidity in case of a further
COVID-19 outbreak or a localised outbreak, including due to a lack of availability of government support programmes
and an inability to furlough employees for shorter durations of closure.

**Economic conditions in the United Kingdom**

While Center Parcs has performed resiliently during both downturns and recoveries, which has resulted in
Center Parcs’ occupancy levels averaging approximately 96% in the last 15 years to 27 February 2020 and
approximately 97% in the last eight years to 27 February 2020, demand for its products and services is sensitive to
disposable income levels and holiday length and destination preferences of its guests, which are linked to general
economic conditions in the United Kingdom. The UK economy entered into a recession in the first half of 2020, with
gross domestic product decreasing by 2.2% from January to March 2020 and decreasing by a further 20.4% between
April and June 2020. Gross domestic product subsequently grew for the next two quarters, with a 16.1% and 1.0%
increase from July to September 2020 and October to December 2020 respectively. However, as compared to gross
domestic product from October to December 2019, gross domestic product from October to December 2020 had
decreased by 7.8%. Over the calendar year 2020 as a whole, the UK’s gross domestic product has contracted by 9.9%.
Weak economic conditions, whether as a result of COVID-19, Brexit or otherwise, may result in a decline in the
number of guests and a decrease in on-site spending. However, such economic conditions in the United Kingdom or

99


-----

a weaker exchange rate of the pound sterling against currencies such as the euro and US dollar may result in more
British families opting to take domestic holidays in the United Kingdom, instead of traveling overseas, which could
result in Center Parcs’ villages being more attractive to such families.

**Seasonality**

Center Parcs’ operations are subject to seasonal factors, as pricing varies significantly depending on the time
of year. Center Parcs’ prices are highest during peak demand periods, which include the main holiday periods at
Easter, the summer holidays and the Christmas/New Year period, along with school half terms. Center Parcs’ revenues
and operating costs are therefore also typically highest during such peak demand periods. Occupancy rates, however,
remain relatively unchanged throughout the year, as Center Parcs’ online dynamic pricing encourages demand outside
of the peak periods. Ahead of the peak demand periods, the peak booking season occurs in late December to late
February, and Center Parcs plans a significant concentration of its marketing campaigns around this time. For financial
year 2021, given the closure of Center Parcs’ villages at its traditional peak marketing period, expenditure on
marketing campaigns was deferred.

**Revenue and other key performance indicators**

**_Revenue_**

Center Parcs’ revenue is principally comprised of accommodation revenue generated from holidays at Center
Parcs’ accommodation, and on-site revenue, comprised of amounts received predominantly from the sale of food and
beverages, retail items, leisure activities and spa-related activities. The combined total of accommodation and on-site
revenue is a key indicator of the overall performance of the business. Accommodation revenue is recognised on a
straight-line basis over the period of the holiday, and on-site revenue is recognised at the point the guest undertakes
the relevant activity or receives the relevant service.

Revenue for financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020 was £469.0 million, £480.2 million and £443.7 million,
respectively. Revenue for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020 was £496.3 million as compared to
£475.3 million for the 52-week period ended 28 February 2019. The proportional contribution of each of the villages
to revenue in the 52-week periods ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019 was broadly consistent with their
contribution to revenue in financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Revenue for the 36-week period ended 31 December
2020 was £114.9 million as compared to £360.2 million for the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020. The
proportional contribution of individual villages to revenue for the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 differed
from their historical contributions due to longer periods of closure for certain villages as a result of localised
restrictions, such as the closure of Sherwood Village from 30 October 2020 and the closure of Woburn Village from
18 December 2020.

Advance payments for accommodation and pre-booked activities are recorded as payments on account within
trade and other payables until the holiday commences. Revenues are primarily driven by occupancy levels and pricing.

**_Occupancy_**

Center Parcs measures occupancy as the average number of units of accommodation occupied as a percentage
of the total number of units of accommodation available, including those units that are off-line for refurbishment.

Occupancy is a key driver of both accommodation and on-site revenue. Higher levels of occupancy generally
result in greater volumes of on-site purchases, reflecting the increased number of guests. Center Parcs’ business is
generally characterised by high occupancy rates, and achieved occupancy rates of 97.6%, 97.1% and 88.0% in the
financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and 97.2% and 97.3% for the 52-week periods ended
28 February 2019 and 27 February 2020, respectively. The high occupancy rates in financial years 2018 and 2019 and
the 52-week periods ended 28 February 2019 and 27 February 2020 were achieved despite approximately 1.5%, 1.3%,
1.2% and 1.5% of Center Parcs’ accommodation being offline due to upgrades and refurbishments in the respective
periods. The lower occupancy level for financial year 2020 reflects the impact of the closure of the villages due to
COVID-19 from 20 March 2020 to the end of the financial year. For the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020,
Center Parcs had an occupancy rate of 30.5%, reflecting village closures and subsequent capacity restrictions.

**_Average Daily Rate_**

One of the key performance indicators Center Parcs uses to help measure and maximise its yield is ADR
which is calculated as the average rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total accommodation income for the period

100


-----

divided by the total number of accommodation nights sold. Due to yield management adjustments, ADR can vary
substantially between low and peak periods. See “— Seasonality”.

ADR for the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 was £238.47, compared with £208.62 for the 36-week
period ended 2 January 2020. ADR for the financial year 2020 was £194.91, compared with £191.74 and £184.95 for
financial years 2019 and 2018, respectively. ADR for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020 was £197.76,
compared with £189.72 for the 52-week period ended 28 February 2019.

Improvements in ADR have primarily reflected inflationary price increases, improved mix of
accommodation following refurbishment upgrades and new build projects (resulting in an increased amount of higher
quality accommodation) as well as yield management improvements. From financial year 2012 through financial year
2020, ADR grew at a CAGR of 4.3%, in part due to refurbishments and a slightly higher proportion of premium
executive accommodation, as well as the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014. The period-on-period ADR growth of
14.3% from the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020 to the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 reflects the
timing of village closures and smaller accommodation units being taken off sale as part of the Group’s ongoing
management of restricted capacity when the villages were open.

**_RevPAL_**

RevPAL is the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on the total accommodation income
divided by the total available number of accommodation nights. RevPAL can also be calculated as ADR multiplied
by occupancy.

RevPAL for the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 was £72.64, compared with £204.41 for the 36week period ended 2 January 2020. RevPAL for the financial year 2020 was £171.54, compared with £186.08 and
£180.46 for financial years 2019 and 2018, respectively. RevPAL for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020
was £192.43, compared with £184.35 for the 52-week period ended 28 February 2019.

The scale of the increases in RevPAL over the years primarily reflects those factors discussed for ADR above.
Center Parcs’ management believes RevPAL to be a meaningful indicator of performance as RevPAL takes into
account both occupancy and ADR. The lower RevPAL for financial year 2020 and the 36-week period ended 31
December 2020 reflects the impact of the COVID-19 closures on occupancy.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

As presented herein, this measure reflects an adjustment to EBITDA by removing the effect of certain
exceptional and non-underlying items which management believes are not indicative of Center Parcs’ underlying
operating performance. See “Presentation of Financial Information”. Adjusted EBITDA for the 36-week period ended
31 December 2020 was £11.6 million, compared with £179.7 million for the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA for financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020 was £228.4 million, £232.6 million and £200.0 million,
respectively. Adjusted EBITDA for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020 was £239.4 million as compared to
£230.8 million for the 52-week period ended 28 February 2019. The proportional contribution of each of the villages
to Adjusted EBITDA in the 52-week periods ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019 was broadly consistent
with their contribution to Adjusted EBITDA in financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020. The proportional contribution of
individual villages to Adjusted EBITDA for the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 differed from their historical
contributions due to longer periods of closure for certain villages as a result of localised restrictions, such as the closure
of Sherwood Village from 30 October 2020 and the closure of Woburn Village from 18 December 2020.

**_Yield Management and Pricing_**

Center Parcs applies “yield management” strategies to maximise revenue levels throughout the year. It
actively adjusts its pricing throughout the 104 available three and four day “breaks” in each year to reflect the seasonal
and other fluctuations in demand. Center Parcs uses ADR and RevPAL to measure its yield management. It has a
dedicated pricing team that monitors advance bookings and adjusts prices for accommodation during the year
according to expected guest demand. The yield management strategies have achieved high occupancy rates as in the
last 15 years to 27 February 2020, Center Parcs’ occupancy rates have averaged approximately 96.2%.

Unlike accommodation prices, on-site prices generally fluctuate less throughout the year and are less seasonal
as these prices have not been subject to similar levels of pricing and yield management as accommodation prices. Onsite prices are also reviewed and increased to reflect inflation.

**_Advance bookings_**

Center Parcs places a strong emphasis on advance bookings, with an average of 19 weeks’ booking-to-arrival
time in financial years 2018 to 2020 (prior to the Closure Periods due to COVID-19), which results in significant
revenue and cash flow visibility. Advance bookings measures the percentage of accommodation available during a
financial year that have been booked at the beginning of that financial year.

Center Parcs holidays are available for booking starting from either 15 months or 18 months in advance of
the scheduled stay date, depending on when in the year the booking is made. Center Parcs collects 30% of the
accommodation cost at the time of booking if the booking is made more than ten weeks in advance of the holiday,
with the balance of the cost collected ten weeks prior to the start of the break that has been booked. If a guest books
less than ten weeks prior to the arrival date, the accommodation cost is payable in full on booking and cannot be
refunded upon cancellation. Certain short-term changes to the payment terms have been made during the period of
closure and the period immediately following re-opening due to COVID-19 to reflect current circumstances. Center
Parcs expects to revert to the previous terms in the near future. Leisure activities available at the villages can be prebooked and pre-paid prior to arrival. Guests can only pre-book leisure activities if they pre-pay and in such cases a
cancellation policy applies. Leisure activities cancelled up to 72 hours before the activity start time will receive a full
refund. If the cancellation is made less than 72 hours before the activity start time, a 50% cancellation charge will
apply. If the cancellation is made less than 10 hours before the activity start time, a 100% cancellation charge will
apply and no refunds will be made.

For each of the financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, an average of approximately 43% of the available
accommodation nights had been booked by the beginning of that financial year. For the financial years 2018, 2019
and 2020, over 60% of leisure and spa activities were pre-booked and pre-paid prior to arrival.

**_Cost of sales and overheads_**

Center Parcs’ principal operating costs are cost of sales, village overheads and central overheads. In addition,
Center Parcs benefits from having a flexible cost base, as demonstrated by its ability to manage its operating expenses
during the COVID-19 Closure Periods. For the purposes of its audited consolidated financial statements, village
overheads and central overheads are treated as ‘administrative expenses before exceptional and non-underlying items’.
The following table sets forth total cost of sales and overheads before exceptional and non-underlying items for the
periods indicated:

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales represents variable direct expenses incurred from revenue-generating activities, primarily
expenses of food and beverages and retail merchandise and associated payroll costs. These costs generally vary with
changes in revenue, as well as inflation and commodity prices. Center Parcs continually evaluates and renegotiates
supply agreements centrally and aims to apply best practices, such as improving the supplier tender process, taking
advantage of promotional offers and re-negotiating key costs in a timely manner, throughout the group.

Center Parcs utilises visibility of forward bookings to optimise the efficiency of personnel across the village
by matching staffing levels to expected demand in various areas of its business.

**_Village Overheads_**

The primary components of village overheads are set forth in the table below:

**53 weeks ended** **52 weeks ended** **52 weeks ended** **36 weeks ended 2** **36 weeks ended**

**26 April** **25 April** **23 April** **January** **31 December**

**2018** **2019** **2020** **2020** **2020**

**£m**
**Village**
**overheads**

Personnel costs 22.5 21.3

......................... 30.9 32.0 28.6

Maintenance costs 7.7 7.6
............................. 10.6 10.8 10.5

Energy costs 8.7 7.1
............................. 12.6 13.0 13.8

Insurance/rent/rates 18.2 2.1
............................... 26.3 25.5 25.3

**Total**
**.............................** **92.1** **92.6** **92.3** 66.8 47.1

The largest cost within village overheads is in respect of personnel costs, which are subject to annual pay
increases as well as to increases arising from legislative and regulatory changes, which include the introduction of the
National Living Wage in April 2016 and subsequent increases to the National Living Wage. For employees who were
furloughed, Center Parcs took the decision to increase salary payments from the 80% of salary payments that were
funded by the government. Costs associated with this were charged to village overheads. Rates costs decreased in the
36-week period ended 31 December 2020 as compared to the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020, as Center Parcs
took advantage of the government rates holiday for leisure businesses.

Center Parcs seeks to manage other village overheads through actively managing costs by benchmarking
each of its villages against each other in order to strive to achieve “best in class”.

**_Central Overheads_**

The primary components of central overheads are set forth in the table below:

**53 weeks ended** **52 weeks ended** **52 weeks ended** **36 weeks ended 2** **36 weeks ended**

Marketing costs are primarily incurred in connection with marketing and advertising campaigns through all
media channels. Center Parcs seeks to manage the cost of its marketing campaigns through the use of cost-efficient
marketing channels such as internet advertising and targeted emails to contacts in its guest database. Marketing
campaigns are planned annually with a significant concentration around the peak booking season of late December to
late February. During the closure of Center Parcs’ villages due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs significantly
reduced its marketing expenditure. Center Parcs has since re-commenced its marketing activities. Other costs
increased due to expenses incurred directly as a result of the impact of COVID-19, such as the cost of personal
protective equipment and other processes introduced to safeguard against COVID-19.

Other costs relates to all other central costs and includes, among other things, credit card charges and IT
costs, less rebates received by Center Parcs from its suppliers.

**Depreciation and Amortisation**

Depreciation and amortisation is comprised of depreciation of leasehold improvements, installations, fixtures
and fittings and motor vehicles and hardware, and amortisation of software and other intangible assets. Depreciation
and amortisation for the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 was £41.9 million compared with £41.0 million
for the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020. Depreciation for financial year 2020 was £53.6 million, compared with
£50.7 million and £47.6 million for financial years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortisation of intangible assets for
financial year 2020 was £7.2 million, compared with £7.0 million and £5.1 million for financial years 2019 and 2018,
respectively.

**Debt and financing costs**

Finance costs comprise interest paid on outstanding debt and loans, primarily in respect of the Class A Loans,
the Class B Loans and the head office mortgage, together with the amortisation over the life of the secured bonds of
deferred costs incurred in the raising of finance.

**Adoption of IFRS 16**

Under IFRS 16, Center Parcs was required to change the way it accounted for leases previously classified as
operating leases under IAS 17 ‘Leases’, which were off-balance-sheet. Center Parcs adopted IFRS 16 on 27 April
2018, using the modified retrospective approach and therefore has not restated figures previously reported under IAS
17 ‘Leases.’

Adoption of IFRS 16 has resulted in certain figures presented in this Offering Memorandum in the financial
years 2020 and 2019, respectively, not being directly comparable with figures reported in similar line items as at prior
reporting dates or for prior reporting periods and the addition of certain new line items. See notes 1, 2 and 16 from
Center Parcs’ audited financial statements for the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019 and Notes 11 and 16 from
Center Parcs’ audited financial statements for the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020.

**_Impact of IFRS 16 on Retained Earnings_**

The impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 on retained earnings was as follows:

**£m**
Recognition of right-of-use assets .................................................................................................................................. 30.9
Recognition of lease liabilities ....................................................................................................................................... (33.1)
Elimination of rent prepayments .................................................................................................................................... (0.4)
Recognition of associated deferred tax .......................................................................................................................... 0.4
**Reduction in retained earnings as at 26 April 2018 ..................................................................................................** **(2.2)**

**_Impact of IFRS 16 on Adjusted EBITDA_**

Under IFRS 16, leased assets and the associated lease liabilities are held on the balance sheet. Depreciation
is recognised on the right-of-use assets and interest expense is recognised on the lease liabilities. IFRS 16 therefore
resulted in removing higher depreciation and interest expense charges from the profit for the period attributable to
equity shareholders, to arrive to Adjusted EBITDA in the 52-week period ended 25 April 2019, when compared to
the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018. In the financial statements for the 53-week period ended 26 April 2018,

lease payments on the Longleat and Woburn village sites were treated as an administrative expense of £1.4 million
and included within Adjusted EBITDA.

**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

The following table sets out the results of operations for the 36-week periods ended 31 December 2020 and
2 January 2020 and the financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, derived from Center Parcs’ financial statements and
related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and the Interim Financial Information incorporated

(1) Exceptional and non-underlying items represented exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses of £2.2 million for the
financial year ended 23 April 2020 represented £2.0 million in costs to exit a contract and £0.2 million of legal and other associated
costs relating to the equity contribution provided by the Brookfield Funds. Exceptional and non-underlying items for the financial year
ended 26 April 2018 represented exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses £1.6 million of costs relating to legal health
and safety claims at Woburn Forest and associated settlements, together with £0.7 million of one-off restructuring and reorganisation
costs.

(2) Exceptional and non-underlying finance expense for the 36 weeks ended 31 December 2020 represents fees incurred to obtain a waiver
of the covenants on the Group’s secured debt. Exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses for the financial year ended 25 April
2019 represented the £6.1 million premium paid on the settlement of Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes and £1.6 million in accelerated
amortisation of deferred issue costs in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes. Exceptional and non-underlying
finance expenses for the financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented the £26.9 million premium paid on the settlement of Center
Parcs’ Class B2 Notes.

(3) Exceptional and non-underlying taxation expense for the financial year ended 23 April 2020 represented the impact of the change in the
applicable deferred tax rate from 17% to 19%, which was partially offset by a taxation credit related to exceptional and non-underlying
administrative expenses. Exceptional and non-underlying taxation income for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 represented a
£1.5 million tax credit related to break costs and the accelerated write-off of deferred fees in connection with the redemption of Center
Parcs’ Class A3 Notes. Exceptional and non-underlying taxation income for the financial year ended 26 April 2018 represented a
£5.3 million tax credit in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class B3 Notes and a £1.9 million tax credit in respect of a
one-off adjustment to group relief relating to restricted interest deductions and subsequent increased capital allowances claims.

(1) From 24 April 2020 to 13 July 2020, 5 November 2020 to 4 December 2020 and 21 December 2020 to 31 December 2020, all five of
Center Parcs’ villages were closed to guests as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and Center Parcs recorded no revenue during these
periods.

(2) From 20 March 2020 to 23 April 2020, all five of Center Parcs’ villages were closed to guests as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
and Center Parcs recorded no revenue during this period.

(3) Sherwood Forest was closed from 30 October 2020 to 31 December 2020 as a result of tiered restrictions as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic.

**36-week period ended 31 December 2020 compared with 36-week period ended 2 January 2020**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue decreased by £245.3 million, or 68.1%, during the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 to
£114.9 million, compared to £360.2 million in the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020. This decrease was primarily
a result of the closure of Center Parcs’ villages during the period as well as operational and capacity restrictions during
periods when the villages were open.

The number of units of accommodation as at 31 December 2020 was 4,335 compared to 4,323 as at 2 January
2020. The increase in the number of units was due to the construction of 12 new units of accommodation in the period.

Occupancy decreased from 98.0% in the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020 to 30.5% during the 36-week
period ended 31 December 2020 due to the impact of the closure of Center Parcs’ villages due to COVID-19. During
the period that the villages were open, occupancy of 60.6% was achieved.

ADR growth continued at all five villages and overall ADR increased by 14.3% to £238.47 in the 36-week
period ended 31 December 2020 compared to the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020, primarily due to the timing
of village closures and smaller accommodation units being taken off sale as part of Center Parc’s ongoing management
of restricted capacity when the villages were open. This increase in ADR was offset by the lower occupancy resulting
in RevPAL of £72.64 (36-week period ended 2 January 2020: £204.41) in the 36-week period ended 31 December
2020.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales decreased to £42.8 million in the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 from £95.3 million
in the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020, reflecting personnel expenses and other operating costs incurred
predominantly when the villages were open. As a percentage of revenue, cost of sales increased to 37.2% in the 36week period ended 31 December 2020 from 26.4% in the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020 as no revenue was
recognised during the Closure Periods and revenue was further limited by capacity restrictions but certain operating
costs were incurred during the Closure Periods. In addition, additional operating costs were required in order to operate
the villages in accordance with COVID-19 secure measures.

**_Administrative expenses before exceptional and non-underlying items_**

Administrative expenses before exceptional and non-underlying items decreased to £60.5 million in the 36week period ended 31 December 2020 from £85.0 million in the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020, reflecting the
elimination of non-essential expenditure during the periods of village closure, as well as the benefit of the UK
Government’s Job Retention Scheme and 12-month business rates holiday. During the Closure Periods, Center Parcs
continued to incur energy and maintenance costs as well as certain payroll costs, which continued to impact
administrative expenses before exceptional and non-underlying items, while it registered no revenue from its villages.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

As a result of the factors described above, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by £168.3 million, or 93.6%, in the
36-week period ended 31 December 2020 as compared to the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020.

**_Depreciation and amortisation_**

Depreciation and amortisation for the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 was broadly stable at
£41.9 million as compared to £41.0 million for the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020.

**_Finance costs and income_**

As at 31 December 2020, the annual interest payable on Center Parcs’ secured debt was £97.1 million with
all tranches of secured debt having a fixed rate of interest.

Finance expense in the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 increased to £73.7 million, including £2.4
million of exceptional and non-underlying finance expense, from £65.2 million in the 36-week period ended 2 January
2020. The increase of £6.1 million in finance expense before exceptional and non-underlying items was due to higher
interest rate payable on the Class B5 Loan incurred in September 2020 than on the debt refinanced with the proceeds
of such issuance, and also included £2.5 million of break costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of the Class
B3 Loan.

Finance income represents bank interest receivable and amounted to £0.1 million for the 36-week period
ended 31 December 2020 as compared to £0.3 million for the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020.

**_Taxation_**

The Group’s taxation assets and liabilities are calculated annually and hence no tax charge or credit is
included in the income statement for the 36-week periods ended 31 December 2020 and 2 January 2020. A corporation
tax refund of £6.0 million arose in the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 as compared with a payment of £11.0
million in the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020.

**_Profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders_**

As a result of the factors described above, profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders decreased
by £177.9 million in the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 as compared to the 36-week period ended 2 January
2020.

**Financial Year 2020 compared with Financial Year 2019**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue decreased by £36.5 million, or 7.6%, during the financial year ended 23 April 2020 to
£443.7 million, compared to £480.2 million in the financial year ended 25 April 2019. This decrease was primarily a

107


-----

result of the closure of Center Parcs’ villages from 20 March 2020 to 23 April 2020 due to COVID-19 as £0 of revenue
was recognised during this closure period.

The number of units of accommodation as at 23 April 2020 was 4,323 compared to 4,317 as at 25 April 2019.
The increase in number of units reflects the construction of six new lodges at Woburn.

Occupancy decreased from 97.1% in the financial year ended 25 April 2019 to 88.0% during the financial
year ended 23 April 2020 due to the impact of the closure of Center Parcs’ villages from 20 March 2020 to 23 April
2020 due to COVID-19.

ADR growth continued at all five villages and overall ADR increased by 1.7% to £194.91 in the financial
year ended 23 April 2020 compared to the financial year ended 25 April 2019, primarily due to refurbishments of
existing lodges and yield management but adversely affected by the closure of the villages in the financial year ended
23 April 2020 during the historically higher ADR Easter holiday period. This increase in ADR was offset by the lower
occupancy resulting in RevPAL of £171.54 (2019: £186.08) in the financial year ended 23 April 2020.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales decreased to £127.2 million in the financial year ended 23 April 2020 from £129.1 million in
the financial year ended 25 April 2019, primarily due to limited cost of sales incurred from 20 March 2020 to 23 April
2020 when Center Parcs’ villages were closed due to COVID-19, which was partially offset by increases in the
National Living Wage. As a percentage of revenue, cost of sales increased to 28.7% in the financial year ended
23 April 2020 from 26.9% in the financial year ended 25 April 2019 as Center Parcs continued to incur certain costs
necessary to maintain the sites in a safe-and-secure condition, including payroll costs (net of the payroll costs
reimbursable under the UK CJRS).

**_Administrative expenses before exceptional and non-underlying items_**

Administrative expenses before exceptional and non-underlying items decreased to £116.5 million in the
financial year ended 23 April 2020 from £118.5 million in the financial year ended 25 April 2019, primarily due to
the closure of Center Parcs’ villages due to COVID-19 from 20 March 2020 to 23 April 2020. During the closure
period, Center Parcs continued to incur energy and maintenance costs as well as certain payroll costs, resulting in a
more limited impact on administrative expenses before exceptional and non-underlying items than on revenue.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

As a result of the factors described above, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by £32.6 million, or 14.0%, in the
financial year ended 23 April 2020 as compared to the financial year ended 25 April 2019.

**_Exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses_**

Exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses were £2.2 million for the financial year ended
23 April 2020 and related to the exit of a supplier contract and legal and other associated costs in respect of the equity
contribution from the Brookfield Funds. No exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses were recognised
in the financial year ended 25 April 2019.

**_Depreciation and amortisation_**

Depreciation and amortisation for the financial year ended 23 April 2020 was £60.8 million, an increase of
£3.1 million compared to the financial year ended 25 April 2019. This increase was primarily due to the Group’s
ongoing capital investment resulting in a larger asset base. The increase in depreciation and amortisation primarily
related to an increase in depreciation of property, plant and equipment – owned assets from £50.1 million in the
financial year ended 25 April 2019 to £53.0 million in the financial year ended 23 April 2020.

**_Finance costs and income_**

For financial year 2020, the annual interest payable on Center Parcs’ secured debt was £90.6 million with all
tranches of secured debt having a fixed rate of interest.

Finance costs in the financial year ended 23 April 2020 represent primarily interest payable on secured debt
and the amortisation of associated deferred issue costs. Finance costs in the financial year ended 25 April 2019 also
included £7.7 million in exceptional and non-underlying costs related to the refinancing of Center Parcs’ Class A3
Notes, including (i) £6.1 million in connection with the premium paid on settlement of the Class A3 Notes and (ii)
£1.6 million in connection with accelerated amortisation of deferred issue costs.

Taxation before exceptional and non-underlying items changed from a tax expense of £15.2 million in the
financial year ended 25 April 2019 to a tax expense of £9.7 million in the financial year ended 23 April 2020.
Exceptional and non-underlying tax expenses of £10.3 million were recognised in the financial year ended 23 April
2020, primarily in relation to the change in the applicable deferred tax rate from 17% to 19%, as compared to
exceptional and non-underlying tax income of £1.5 million in the financial year ended 25 April 2019. Corporation tax
of £13.1 million was paid during the financial year ended 23 April 2020 compared with £3.1 million in the financial
year ended 25 April 2019 and made payments for taxation group relief of £0.4 million in the financial year ended 23
April 2020 compared with £10.9 million in the financial year ended 25 April 2019.

**_Profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders_**

As a result of the factors described above, profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders decreased
by £39.8 million, or 63.4%, in the financial year ended 23 April 2020 as compared to the financial year ended 25 April
2019.

**Financial Year 2019 compared with Financial Year 2018**

**_Revenue_**

Center Parcs revenue for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 increased by £11.2 million, or 2.4%, to
£480.2 million reflecting growth in accommodation revenue of 3.8% and on-site revenue of 0.3% compared to the
financial year ended 26 April 2018, offset by the fact that the financial year ended 25 April 2019 had 52 weeks whereas
the financial year ended 26 April 2018 had 53 weeks. Center Parcs experienced broadly consistent underlying revenue
growth at all five villages.

Center Parcs’ occupancy remained strong at 97.1% in the financial year ended 25 April 2019, a slight
decrease of 0.5% from 97.6% in the financial year ended 26 April 2018. The number of units of accommodation
increased to 4,317 as at 25 April 2019 compared to 4,227 as at 26 April 2018, reflecting the construction of 90 new
units of accommodation during the financial year ended 25 April 2019, including 51 one-bedroom apartments at
Elveden Forest. ADR increased to £191.74 in the financial year ended 25 April 2019, an increase of 3.7% from
£184.95 in the financial year ended 26 April 2018. The ADR growth and high occupancy levels drove an increase in
RevPAL to £186.08 in financial year 2019, an increase of 3.1%, from £180.46 in the financial year ended 26 April
2018.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales increased to £129.1 million in the financial year ended 25 April 2019 from £123.7 million in
the financial year ended 26 April 2018, in line with the growth in on-site revenue and the impact of the increases in
national living wage effective from 1 April 2018 (from £7.50 to £7.83) and 1 April 2019 (from £7.83 to £8.21).

**_Administrative expenses before exceptional and non-underlying items_**

Administrative expenses before exceptional and non-underlying items increased to £118.5 million in the
financial year ended 25 April 2019 from £116.9 million in the financial year ended 26 April 2018.

Exceptional and non-underlying administrative expenses of £2.3 million in the financial year ended 26 April
2018 represented £1.6 million of costs relating to legal claims and associated settlements, together with £0.7 million
of one-off restructuring and reorganisation costs.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

As a result of the factors described above, Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 increased
by £4.2 million or 1.8% in comparison to the prior year.

**_Depreciation and amortisation_**

Depreciation and amortisation for the financial year ended 25 April 2019 was £57.7 million, an increase of
£5.0 million, or 9.5%, compared to depreciation and amortisation for the financial year ended 26 April 2018. This

109


-----

increase reflected Center Parcs’ capital investment programme which resulted in a larger asset base, including
depreciation resulting from capital expenditures during the financial year ended 26 April 2018.

**_Finance costs and income_**

With effect from 20 November 2018, when Center Parcs issued £100.0 million of additional Class A4 Notes
and £379.5 million of new Class A5 Notes, annual interest payable on the Group’s secured debt was £90.6 million.
All tranches of secured debt attract a fixed rate of interest.

Finance costs in the period under review principally represent interest on secured debt and interest on related
party loans. Interest on related party loans is not cash-settled.

On 20 November 2018, when Center Parcs issued £100.0 million of additional Class A4 Notes and £379.5
million of new Class A5 Notes. Part of the proceeds was used to settle £350.0 million of Class A3 Notes that had an
expected maturity date of 28 February 2020. Make-whole costs of £6.1 million in respect of the settlement of the Class
A3 Notes were recognised as an exceptional and non-underlying finance expense, as discussed above, together with
£1.6 million of accelerated amortisation of deferred issue costs in respect of the Class A3 Notes.

Exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses in the financial year ended 25 April 2019 included
£7.7 million in exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses, of which £6.1 million represented the premium paid
on the settlement of Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes and £1.6 million represented accelerated amortization of deferred
issue costs in connection with the redemption of Center Parcs’ Class A3 Notes.

Exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses in the financial year ended 26 April 2018 included £26.9
million in exceptional and non-underlying finance expenses, representing the premium paid on the settlement of
Center Parcs’ Class B2 Notes.

**_Taxation_**

Corporation tax paid and payments for group relief totalled £14.0 million during the financial year ended
25 April 2019 compared with £1.0 million in the financial year ended 26 April 2018.

**_Profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders_**

As a result of the factors described above, profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders increased
by £11.3 million, or 21.9%, in the financial year ended 25 April 2019 as compared to the financial year ended
26 April 2018.

**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**

Center Parcs’ principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditure and debt service. Center
Parcs has historically funded operations and capital expenditure with cash flow from operations. As at 31 December
2020, Center Parcs had cash and cash equivalents of £53.2 million (£30.7 million as at 2 January 2020), and negative
working capital of £144.7 million. Working capital is defined as the net value of Center Parcs’ inventories, trade and
other receivables and current trade and other payables (excluding taxation creditors and capital and interest accruals).

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs closed all of its villages from 20 March 2020 to 13 July
2020, with an initial re-opening on 14 July 2020 with capacity restrictions, at approximately 65% capacity. However,
as a result of tiered restrictions, Sherwood Village was closed from 30 October 2020 to 12 April 2021. Furthermore,
in response to the second wave of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and the second national lockdown, Center Parcs
closed all of its villages from 5 November 2020 to 4 December, with a brief period when Longleat Forest, Elveden
Forest, Whinfell Forest and Woburn Forest were re-opened from 5 December 2020 until 18 December 2020 when
Woburn Village was closed. Center Parcs subsequently closed the remaining three villages on 21 December 2020.
During the Closure Periods, Center Parcs rephased its non-essential capital expenditure projects. Center Parcs also
deferred corporation tax payments and VAT payments and furloughed up to 90% of its employees in accordance with
the UK government’s CJRS scheme. Together, these actions reduced operating expenses by approximately £14 million
on average per four-week period, or approximately 70%, to approximately £6 to £7 million on average per four-week
period from 24 April 2020 to 18 June 2020 and from 21 December to 25 February 2021, representing a closed period,
compared to approximately £20 million on average per four-week period from 26 April 2019 to 27 February 2020,
representing a typical operating period.

Center Parcs’ villages re-opened on 12 April 2021 with capacity limitations as Center Parcs continues to
follow UK Government mandated policies and procedures to operate a COVID-19 secure environment. Capacity

levels will be reviewed in due course pursuant to government guidelines and health and safety considerations. Center
Parcs implemented strict cash management procedures to conserve liquidity, including the rephasing of capital
investment projects and cessation of non-essential operating activities.

Center Parcs further strengthened its liquidity position by equity contributions from the Brookfield Funds of
£120.0 million, comprising £41.5 million received in April 2020, £27.5 million received in May 2020 and £51.0
million received in February 2021, and the Intercompany Account Advance of £70 million received on 14 July 2020.
Center Parcs also has access to a £90 million undrawn committed liquidity facility, which is available to pay certain
senior expenses and interest on Class A Notes. As at 15 April 2021, Center Parcs had £79.4 million in cash and cash
equivalents at the bank.

The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic creates material uncertainty in Center Parcs’ ability
to predict future liquidity requirements. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Center Parcs’ Business and Industry—
As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is material uncertainty about Center Parcs’ ability to
continue as a going concern” and Note 1 to the 2020 Audited Financial Statements. Should subsequent waves of
COVID-19 require a future closure of Center Parcs villages, Center Parcs anticipates that it will be able to meet its
working capital requirements for approximately four months without sourcing additional funding.

Center Parcs may, from time to time, seek other sources of funding, which may include debt or equity
financings depending on its financing needs and market conditions.

The maturity profile of Center Parcs’ existing borrowings as at 23 April 2020 was as follows:

**Less than one** **One to five** **Greater than** **Deferred**

£69.4 million, or 58.2%, in cash flows from operating activities for the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 as
compared with the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020 was the closure of Center Parcs’ villages due to COVID-19.
Net cash from operating activities in the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 also included receipt of proceeds
from the Intercompany Account Advance of £70 million.

111


-----

Net cash from operating activities was £237.3 million, £225.2 million and £151.2 million in financial years
2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The primary reason for the decrease of £12.1 million, or 5.1%, in cash flows from
operating activities for financial year 2019 as compared with financial year 2018 was an increase in corporation tax
paid and payments for taxation group relief. The primary reason for the decrease in net cash from operating activities
of £74.0 million, or 32.9%, for financial year 2020 as compared with financial year 2019 was the closure of Center
Parcs’ villages due to COVID-19 from 20 March 2020 to 23 April 2020.

Net cash used in investing activities was £23.5 million and £39.1 million in the 36-week period ended 31
December 2020 and the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities was
£85.5 million, £66.0 million and £57.4 million in financial year 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used in
investing activities in all financial years predominantly relates to the purchase of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets.

Net cash used in financing activities was £9.4 million and £109.5 million in the 36-week period ended 31
December 2020 and the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities in
the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 predominantly related to the payment of interest, partially offset by the
net proceeds of a refinancing of Center Parcs’ secured debt and the proceeds from an equity contribution. Net cash
used in financing activities in the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020 predominantly related to the payment of
interest and dividends.

Net cash used in financing activities was £139.7 million, £145.1 million and £117.6 million in financial year
2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities in financial year 2018 predominantly related
to the payment of interest and dividends, partially off-set by the net proceeds of a refinancing of Center Parcs’ secured
debt. Net cash used in financing activities in financial year 2019 predominantly related to the payment of interest and
dividends, partially off-set by the net proceeds of a refinancing of Center Parcs’ secured debt. Net cash used in
financing activities in financial year 2020 predominantly related to the payment of interest and dividends, off-set by
the receipt of an equity contribution.

**Capital expenditure**

The following table shows Center Parcs’ capital expenditure breakdown for the financial years 2008 to 2020:

Center Parcs defines capital expenditure as additions to property, plant and equipment and other intangible
assets. Center Parcs defines maintenance capital expenditure as the capital expenditure required on the central
buildings, infrastructure and facilities to maintain the ongoing standards of these areas. Center Parcs defines
investment capital expenditure as where it expects to generate a return on capital. Investment capital expenditure
includes capital expenditure incurred in respect of the development of villages, amenities and facilities, including
building new accommodation; upgrading existing accommodation and upgrading, adding or extending restaurants,
retail outlets and other facilities.

Capital investments are organised and planned annually around significant, regular planned maintenance and
capital expenditure that is intended to maintain high occupancy levels and drive revenue growth through improved
appeal of accommodation units, facilities and amenities.

The capital refurbishment programme of Center Parcs’ accommodation units can be broken into two distinct
investment cycles within a 16- to 20-year period:

    - _Refurbishment: approximately every eight to ten years, each unit needs to be refurbished to maintain_
Center Parcs’ targeted standards, which typically ensures existing levels of ADR are maintained;
and

112


-----

    - _Upgrade: following the refurbishment cycle there is typically a further eight to ten years before a_
unit is upgraded, which includes a full refurbishment of the unit and also an upgrade of the standard
to add new features and to modernise the style of the unit.

Although investment capital expenditure increases during the investment phase of a refurbishment or upgrade
programme, profit margins and operating profit generally increase in the years following completion of the investment
programmes as guests demand higher-end or upgraded accommodation.

The covenants under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement require the Obligors to spend a minimum
of £18.5 million per year in relation to maintenance capital expenditure and an average of £6.0 million per annum
over a four year period on investment capital expenditure. During the closure of Center Parcs’ villages as a result of
COVID-19 restrictions, Center Parcs rephased its capital expenditure and substantially decreased its investment capital
expenditure, although it is still confident of meeting its required covenant levels of capital expenditure. During the 36week period ended 31 December 2020, total capital expenditure was £22.6 million, of which £14.5 million was spent
on maintenance capital expenditure and £8.1 million on investment capital expenditure, as compared to total capital
expenditure of £34.1 million during the 36-week period ended 2 January 2020, of which £16.8 million was spent on
maintenance capital expenditure and £17.3 million on investment capital expenditure. Total capital expenditure was
£84.5 million, £66.1 million and £52.8 million for financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Center Parcs
spent £27.5 million on maintenance capital expenditure and £25.3 million on investment capital expenditure in
financial year 2020, of which investment capital expenditure of £6.2 million related to new builds, £13.4 million
related to accommodation upgrades and £5.7 million related to other investment projects such as food and beverage,
retail and leisure activity offerings. Center Parcs spent £27.1 million on maintenance capital expenditure and
£39.1 million on investment capital expenditure in financial year 2019, of which investment capital expenditure of
£10.3 million related to new builds, £12.1 million related to accommodation upgrades, £9.0 million related to pool
complex upgrades and £7.7 million related to other investment projects such as food and beverage, retail and leisure
activity offerings. Historically, changes in capital expenditure have been driven primarily by varying levels of
investment capital expenditure (including accommodation upgrades) with underlying maintenance capital expenditure
remaining relatively stable. In financial years 2020, 2021 and the current refurbishment cycle, Center Parcs continued
its upgrade programme and 2,347 units of accommodation have been upgraded as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, driving continued growth in ADR. In order to support liquidity in light of the impact of the COVID19 pandemic, Center Parcs decreased its capital expenditure in financial year 2021 and currently expects its total
capital expenditure for financial year 2021 to be approximately £35.0 to £40.0 million, with investments in lodge
upgrades, new builds and on-village projects. Center Parcs expects that its capital expenditure will return to its historic
average levels in financial year 2022, subject to the planned lifting of COVID-19 restrictions.

**Working capital**

Center Parcs has historically had negative working capital requirements largely arising from the payment by
guests for their short breaks in advance of arrival. The closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have seen a
large proportion of these advance payments refunded to guests, causing a working capital outflow. Following the reopening of Center Parcs’ villages, a return to its historic negative working capital requirements is expected.

Center Parcs’ trade receivables are primarily composed of corporate sales made through its Corporate Events
division, and inventories are primarily composed of stock in Center Parcs retail and food and beverage outlets. Center
Parcs’ trade and other payables primarily relate to advance accommodation income received from guests, trade
creditors, accrued expenditure, VAT and payroll taxes due and other current liabilities.

Center Parcs has historically funded working capital requirements through cash generated from operations.
There is a degree of seasonality in the working capital requirements linked to accommodation revenue receipts.

Payments held on account have historically been at their lowest level after the Christmas period and prior to
the key booking period of late December to late February and at the end of each calendar year. This contrasts with the
significantly higher payments held on account typically seen in April or in advance of the summer holiday season.
With the enforced closures of the villages and uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, this key booking
period was adversely affected in 2021. However, with the announcement of the re-opening of the villages, an increase
in booking activity was seen.

Depending upon its rate of growth and profitability, including as a result of travel and operating restrictions,
Center Parcs may require additional equity or debt financing to meet working capital requirements or capital

expenditure needs. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if needed, will be available when required or,
if available, on terms satisfactory to Center Parcs.

**Contractual commitments**

As at 31 December 2020, Center Parcs had capital expenditure contracted for but not provided of
£9.6 million. The related projects have since been completed or are currently ongoing. Center Parcs has no other
material contractual commitments with the exception of the headleases on the Longleat and Woburn properties. The
total current annual rentals on these leases are approximately £0.9 million and £0.6 million, respectively, and the lease
termination dates are 22 February 2073 and 23 December 2109, respectively. The rent in respect of each lease is
subject to review every five years, based on any increase in revenue.

**Off-balance sheet arrangements and contingent liabilities**

Center Parcs has no off-balance sheet arrangements or contingent liabilities.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market and Credit risks**

**_Market risks_**

_General economic conditions_

The disposable income of Center Parcs’ guests and/or their holiday preferences are and will be affected by
changes in the general economic environment and this may result in a fall in the number of guests and/or a decrease
in on-site expenditure. Center Parcs regularly reviews its product offering and engages with guests to ensure it provides
value for money to meet guest needs.

_Brexit_

On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom formally left the European Union and entered the Brexit Transition
Period, which expired on 31 December 2020. On 31 December 2020, the UK implemented the EU—UK Trade and
Cooperation Agreement on future relations between the EU and the UK, which entered into force provisionally on 1
January 2021. There remains significant uncertainty as to how the Brexit will affect relations between the UK and the
EU, including the legal rights and obligations for businesses in certain services industries not covered by the EU—
UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. Thus far, the formal exit has not had a material impact on the business of
Center Parcs. However, Center Parcs will continue to monitor political and economic developments and has plans in
place for all eventualities.

_COVID-19_

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on Center Parcs’ business. Whilst the villages are now
re-opened since 12 April 2021, the situation continues to evolve with government advice being regularly updated. The
measures mandated by the UK government are outside the control of Center Parcs. However, Center Parcs has
experienced teams who are capable of managing the impacts of the disruption on guests, colleagues and other key
stakeholders. These teams have already put in place procedures to ensure the safe re-opening of the villages and Center
Parcs will continue to monitor changing advice and implement further procedures as required.

Despite the government’s intention to lift all restrictions no sooner than 21 June 2021, subject to various
conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and it is not clear how long government restrictions and
social distancing measures will last, or whether tighter restrictions will be reintroduced resulting in one or more
villages having to close again. It is therefore not certain how quickly operations will return to pre-crisis levels, if at
all.

If these risks and uncertainties materialise, they could result in a material change in the forecast liquidity
position of Center Parcs.

_Competition_

The Center Parcs brand is synonymous with high quality short breaks in a forest environment but Center
Parcs competes for the discretionary expenditure of potential guests, who could choose to take short breaks at other
destinations or participate in other recreational activities. Center Parcs believes that this risk is mitigated by the
strength of the Center Parcs brand and the continual investment in the accommodation and central facilities (including
retail and restaurants), coupled with the innovation amongst the leisure activities and the responsiveness to guest
surveys.

114


-----

_Seasonality and weather_

Demand for short breaks is influenced by the main holiday periods at Easter, the summer holidays and the
Christmas/New Year period. This risk is mitigated by online dynamic pricing which encourages demand outside of
the peak periods. The accommodation is located within forest environments and a significant number of activities take
place outdoors. Therefore, demand may be impacted by the prevailing weather. This risk is minimal because guests
tend not to book on impulse and the vast majority of breaks and activities are booked in advance. Additionally, Center
Parcs maintains diversity between its indoor and outdoor activities to mitigate this risk.

**_Financial risks_**

The Directors and senior managers regularly review the financial requirements of Center Parcs and the
associated risks. Center Parcs does not use complicated financial instruments and where financial instruments are
used, they are used to reduce interest rate risk. Center Parcs does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes.
Center Parcs finances its operations through a mixture of retained earnings and borrowings as required. Historically,
Center Parcs has sought to reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring its funding using the underlying
asset value.

_Interest rate risk_

Principal sources of borrowings are fixed interest rate loan notes.

_Liquidity risk_

Center Parcs maintains sufficient levels of cash and committed funding to enable it to meet its medium-term
working capital, lease liability and funding obligations. Rolling forecasts of liquidity requirements are prepared and
monitored, and surplus cash is invested in interest bearing accounts.

_Currency risk_

Whilst no borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies, a number of suppliers are exposed to the euro
and the U.S. dollar. Wherever possible Center Parcs enters into supply contracts denominated in Sterling. Center Parcs
does not operate a hedging facility to manage currency risk as it is not considered to be material.

_Credit risk_

Cash balances are held on deposit with a number of UK banking institutions. Concentrations of credit risk
with respect to trade receivables are limited as the vast majority of guests pay in advance.

_Financial reporting risk_

The Group’s financial systems are required to process a large number of transactions securely and accurately;
any weaknesses in the systems could result in the incorrect reporting of financial results and covenant compliance.

**Accounting policies**

The following accounting policies are considered to be pertinent to this review of Center Parcs’ operating
and financial results. See Note 1 to the 2020 Audited Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

_Revenue recognition_

Revenue relates to accommodation rental income on holidays commenced during the period, together with
other related income that primarily arises from on-village leisure, retail and food and beverage spend. Revenue relating
to accommodation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the holiday. The performance obligation
for non-rental income, and hence the basis for revenue recognition, is when the related product or service is provided
to the guest. All revenue is recorded net of VAT.

Payment for accommodation rental income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded
as ‘deferred income’ within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences. As such no revenue was
recognised during the period the villages were closed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A number of trading units on each holiday village are operated by concession partners. Revenue due in
respect of such units is recognised on an accruals basis.

All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.

_Property, plant and equipment_

Center Parcs carries property, plant and equipment at cost rather than current valuation. As such, no increases
in the value of Center Parcs’ property, plant and equipment are recognised in the financial statements. Any impairment
to the carrying value of these assets is recognised in the income statement.

_Maintenance expenditure_

It is the policy of Center Parcs to maintain its land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance
expenditure increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to generate, this expenditure is
capitalised. All other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

_Borrowings_

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest
method.

**Critical accounting policies**

_Discount rate used to determine the value of Center Parcs’ defined benefit pension scheme obligation_

Center Parcs’ defined benefit pension scheme obligation is discounted at a rate set by reference to market
yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Significant judgment is required when setting
the criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived.

_Useful economic lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets_

Center Parcs reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets
at the end of each reporting period. During the 52-week period ended 23 April 2020, management has concluded that
no revision is required to either useful economic lives or residual values of these assets.

_Impairment test for goodwill_

Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating
units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires Center Parcs to estimate future cash
flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.

**Overview of the UK Holiday Market**

The UK holiday market is defined as the market for UK residents holidaying in the UK (domestic but
excluding Northern Ireland) and UK residents holidaying internationally (overseas).

Center Parcs operates in the UK holiday centres market, which consists of three segments: (a) traditional
holiday centres; (b) holiday parks centred around caravan or lodge accommodation; and (c) forest villages. These
sub-segments of the holiday market are described later on in this section.

**Economic Environment and Outlook**

**_Global Financial Crisis and Aftermath_**

Based on Mintel’s analysis, following the global financial crisis in 2008, the performance of the UK holiday
market was continuously impacted until 2014. Historical data shows that growth rates in domestic tourism tend
to rise and fall in relation to growth rates in the overseas holiday market. The last recession worked to the
advantage of UK tourism, in which Center Parcs is present, triggering a steep drop in holidays abroad and a
“staycation effect” which saw many consumers switching from overseas destinations to holidays closer to home.

Since 2012, based on data from the Office of National Statistics (“ONS”) and the Great Britain Tourism
Survey by VisitEngland, VisitScotland and Visit Wales (“GBTS”), overseas holiday volumes experienced a period
of steady recovery, growing 30% between 2014 and 2019. In contrast, volumes in the UK market fell by 7% in
2014, before recovering with 6% growth between 2015 and 2019, with the growth in both segments reflecting rising
economic recovery and consumer confidence. Total spend on overseas holidays grew from £28.9 billion in 2014 to
£43.4 billion in 2018 (driven by the recovery in volumes and an increase in average spend). The average spend on
overseas holidays increased at a higher rate than UK holidays at 8% over the period from £641 in 2014 to £692 in
2018. Total spend on UK holidays for 2018 sat at £14.3 billion, with an average spend of £247.

**_Post-Brexit Performance_**

After the Brexit vote in June 2016, the Pound’s decline in value made overseas trips more expensive for
UK consumers. A weaker Pound was one of the main contributors to the staycation boom in 2009, according to
Mintel, and this effect coupled with broader Brexit uncertainties led to a slowdown in growth in overseas holidays.
Volumes in the UK market experienced a healthy increase of 6% in 2017, followed by a decline of 2% in 2018, and
4% rebound in 2019.

2019 was a record year for domestic tourism in the UK. The volume and value of domestic holidays taken
by British residents increased by 4.4% and 1.3% respectively in 2019 compared to the previous year, reaching record
levels of 60.5 million trips and £14.5 billion in expenditure. The relatively low value of the Pound and uncertainties
relating to Brexit encouraged more consumers to substitute an overseas holiday for a staycation that year.

**_Outlook and Impact of COVID-19_**

The global COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns both in the UK and internationally have had
a dramatic impact on the domestic and overseas holiday market. According to CAPA, European airline seat
capacity experienced several recurring weeks of over 80% year-on-year declines during April and May 2020
as the pandemic took hold. While a partial recovery was observed towards August 2020, subsequent waves of
COVID-19 and associated lockdowns again put pressure on the international travel market. Mintel expects

117


-----

the value of overseas holidays to have declined by 79% in 2020. According to CAPA, European airline seat
capacity for the week of 12 April 2021 remained heavily depressed at approximately 72% below 2019 levels.
While the UK is expected to relax international travel restrictions over the summer of 2021, cases of COVID19 remain high globally, which is likely to have an ongoing negative impact on overseas travel from the UK.

For 2020 as a whole, Government-enforced lockdown measures throughout the year required large
parts of the economy to close for significant periods, and the domestic tourism market was severely impacted
as a result. Mintel expects the total value of domestic holidays taken by British residents to have declined by
46% in 2020 compared to the previous year, driven by a 45% decline in volumes (from 60.5 million trips in
2019, to 33.0 million in 2020) and a marginal decline in average spend (from £240 in 2019, to £237 in 2020).

The pattern of increased demand for outdoor activities such as visiting natural parks and beaches at
the expense of cities and indoor activities is expected to remain visible as long as health threats exist in the
market. According to Mintel, being outdoors is a relatively strong motivator to take a holiday in the UK in
2021, with 29% of those looking to holiday in the UK wanting to do so to be outdoors as at October 2020.
Furthermore, 34% of those who are planning to take a staycation in the year following October 2020 are
interested in taking a rural or countryside based holiday, compared to 25% who took such a holiday in the 12
months to November 2019.

With a roadmap now in place for the expected progressive opening up of the economy, the value of
domestic holidays taken by British residents in 2021 is forecast to be 11% short of pre-COVID-19 levels
(based on 2019, forecast created on 19 January 2021), while demand for staycations over the summer period
is expected to exceed pre-COVID-19 levels due to pent-up demand, according to Mintel. Mintel expects the
value of the domestic holiday market to fully recover in 2022, with the fundamental consumer appetite for
travel and broader shift to experiential spending not changing as a result of COVID-19. In contrast, the
overseas travel market is not expected to recover until 2024, with the likelihood of restrictions on travel to
some countries, potential quarantine measures and the higher cost of overseas travel expected to further fuel
demand for stays closer to home.

COVID-19 has led to increased online interactions including the use of videoconferencing tools to
keep in touch with family, friends, colleagues and clients. More screen time has increased the value of
breaking free of the virtual world. Meanwhile, the pandemic has accelerated consumers’ drive to look after
their mental and physical wellbeing. As a result, rural escapes that involve digital detox activities and breaks
are likely to appeal to more consumers than prior to COVID-19, according to Mintel.

This acceleration in demand for wellness breaks and activities is supported by VisitBritain’s COVID19 Consumer Weekly Tracker, which, in the report published on 1 April 2021, highlights the seaside and
countryside as the most likely destinations of survey respondents for the Spring of 2021 (defined as between
April and June 2021), and suggests that “outdoor areas”, “outdoor leisure or sports activities”, and
“predominantly outdoor attractions”, are all likely to attract more visitors than they may have previously.

According to VisitBritain, 46% intend to take the same number or more short breaks, defined as 1-3
nights, in the UK over the rest of 2021 than normal, with 30% expecting to take fewer short breaks (24%
being unsure). For breaks of 4+ nights, these figures are 44%, 31% and 25%, respectively. The same survey
suggests that overseas trips will be more negatively impacted, with approximately 40% of respondents
intending to take fewer trips than normal and less than 30% intending to take more or the same number of
trips. For those taking trips in the Spring, 71% expect to travel using their own car, versus 65% for trips taken
over the Summer (defined as between July and September 2021).

In England, large parts of the hospitality sector were allowed to reopen from 12 April 2021.

**UK Holiday Centre Market Trends**

The longer-term key trends impacting the UK holiday centres market include the following:

**_Change in Guests: Socio-Economic Profile_**

According to Mintel, changes in socio-economic groups (“SEG”) and in particular the growth in the
ABC1 category (“ABC1”) have historically benefited the holiday market and are likely to continue to do so in

118

the medium term. SEGs are based on the chief income earner and are defined as follows:

**SEG** **Occupation of Chief Income Earner**

A . . . . .  Higher managerial, administrative or professional

B . . . . .  Intermediate managerial, administrative or professional

C1 . . . .  Supervisory or clerical and junior managerial, administrative or professional

C2 . . . .  Skilled manual workers

D . . . . .  Semi-skilled and unskilled manual workers

E . . . . .  Unemployed

With high standards and expectations for their holidays, the ABC1 SEGs form the core target customer
base for Center Parcs. According to the latest available data, the ABC1 segment as a whole represented 55% of the
UK population making it the largest segment of the UK population.

**_Changes in Demographics_**

According to the ONS, growth in demand for holiday centres in the UK is expected to be positively affected
by demographic changes, including the rise in the number of families with young children in particular. Based on
data released in October 2019, the number of children aged 10-14 in the UK is forecast to increase by 9.5% by
2023, from 3.9 million in 2018 to 4.2 million in 2023. The number of 15-19-year olds is forecast to increase by
8.2% over the same period.

The ONS forecasts the number of adults aged 25-44 years to increase from 17.4 million in 2018 to 17.8
million in 2023 (an increase of approximately 2.7%). This growth is expected to benefit the UK holiday centre
market as it increases the number of prime target guests, namely families, for holiday centres over the short to
medium term.

Mintel believes the government’s existing railcard discount scheme for 16 to 25-year-olds (offering a 30%
discount) which was extended to those aged between 26 and 30 in the spring of 2018, should incentivise 26 to 30year-olds to visit more UK destinations for breaks.

**_Multiple Holiday Taking and Trend Towards Shorter Breaks_**

Prior to COVID-19, the trend towards shorter breaks remained steady with the UK short break market (1-3
nights) outperforming the UK domestic market as a whole. According to the GBTS, short breaks comprising
between one to three nights accounted for almost two-thirds of the total UK domestic tourism market over 2015 to
2018, and the volume of breaks of up to 7 days increased by 1.4% over the same period. In 2019, according to
GBTS, 67% of domestic breaks in Great Britain were for a period of 1-3 nights, an increase of 8.2% from 2018,
with a further 29% being for 4-7 nights. In 2019, according to GBTS, 34% of domestic trips were taken by families.

**_Domestic Holiday Behaviour and Destination_**

According to the GBTS, the number of domestic holidays taken grew by 4.4% to 60.5 million trips in 2019
from 57.9 million in 2018, while holiday expenditure rose by 1.3% to £14.5 billion. Mintel’s research indicates that
62% of the UK adult population took a domestic holiday in the year to November 2019, versus 50% who took a
holiday overseas.

Domestic holiday participation has risen since the Brexit referendum in 2016, which, according to Mintel,
shows that holidaying is among the highest priorities of British nationals. As shown in the chart below, the number
of domestic countryside holidays has historically remained broadly the same, reflecting stable demand for holiday
offerings in natural surroundings.

(1) Percentage calculations based on total holiday volumes consisting of the sum for the following categories: Seaside, City/large town, Small
town and Countryside/village. The sum of the four destination types exceeds total market volume reported in the December 2020 Domestic
Tourism report as there are a proportion of holidays which combine more than one destination type.

According to Mintel a “digital detox” trend is accelerating, where city dwellers seek to escape their
smartphones and computers. Thus, there is a growing need for holiday brands to encourage those in the 16 to 34year-old age bracket to disconnect and de-stress in the countryside. Increased screen time as a result of COVID19 has increased the value of breaking free of the virtual world, and therefore, Mintel suggests rural escapes that
involve digital detox activities and breaks are likely to appeal to more consumers than prior to COVID-19.

**Market Segmentation and Product Offering**

While Center Parcs believes that it has a unique product offering, it is sometimes considered to be part of
the UK holiday centres market. The UK holiday centres market is divided into three distinct segments: (a)
traditional holiday centres; (b) holiday parks (large caravan/chalet parks offering an extensive range of holiday
centre facilities); and (c) forest villages (also considered as holiday centres but aimed more at rural quiet rather
than holiday bustle). These segments compete with each other to a certain extent within the UK holiday centres
market. However, while traditional holiday centres and holiday parks tend to be coastal sites, dominated by
guests mainly from the C1-C2 socio-economic category, forest villages are based in woodland sites and attract
mainly ABC1 families looking for active forest village breaks and premium lodge park accommodation.

According to Mintel, nearly half of parents believe it is important to stay in a resort with family-friendly
elements such as pools, children’s activities and entertainment. This is now becoming a strong selling point for family
holidays in the context of rising childhood obesity, increasing amounts of time spent by children on technology
devices, and a perceived lack of safe public spaces for children to play outside the home. Leading overseas holiday
brands are investing heavily in their own bespoke family resort brands. In the domestic UK market, leading holiday
centre brands such as Center Parcs, Butlins and Haven offer a similar experience. Moreover, the focal point of Center
Parcs’ villages is its Sub-tropical Swimming Paradise which, together with Center Parcs’ premium product offering
(accommodation, leisure activities, food and beverage, retail and Aqua Sana spa), underpins the attractiveness of the
Center Parcs’ concept for ABC1 guests.

_Traditional holiday centres comprise the traditional brands such as Butlins, Warner and Pontins (a smaller_
UK operator), which were originally based on a 1950s “holiday camp” formula. They have evolved over time
(now fewer in numbers and individually larger in scale) and have invested significantly in recent years in
improving their accommodation and range of activities. These traditional centres are generally in beach locations
and therefore tend to primarily complement a family beach holiday. They are characterised by permanent
accommodation (rather than mobile homes) in blocks or detached buildings. Their offering may be full board
or self-catering, but generally includes free family-oriented entertainment, variety shows and leisure facilities,
such as swimming pools, amusement arcades, fairground-type rides and outdoor sports facilities, such as five-aside football, a climbing wall and crazy golf.

_Holiday parks_ constitute the largest sector within the UK holiday centres market, both by number of
locations and volume of holidays sold and comprise brands such as Parkdean Resorts, Haven and Hoseasons.
However, within the holiday park segment, it is difficult to distinguish between what are essentially larger
caravan parks with few facilities, and those parks with amenities and activities that are sophisticated enough to
be categorised as a traditional holiday centre. As consumer expectations increase, there is more demand for
holiday parks to provide a greater range of value- added services such as pools, restaurants, children’s clubs and
entertainment. Holiday parks cater to customers looking for three types of services: (a) hiring mobile homes or
fixed caravans; (b) purchasing these mobile homes; and (c) hiring space for towed caravans and tent campers.
Although they vary considerably in size, holiday parks are generally smaller in scale than the traditional holiday
centres. Holiday parks are often situated in coastal locations, often in scenic areas.

_Forest villages_ differ from traditional holiday centres and holiday parks which are part of the tradition of
the British seaside holiday. Forest villages are based inland, in woodland and water settings, with an explicitly

122


-----

environmental ethos (a car-free, family-friendly environment), marketed primarily and explicitly to affluent family
groups in the ABC1 SEGs, as compared with the broader targeting of the traditional holiday centres. The
accommodation in forest villages is permanent and generally more spacious than traditional holiday centres. Forest
village accommodation provides self- catering facilities and open-plan living, with luxurious top-end
accommodation standards. The focus is activity-based, with a wide range of sporting, creative and spa/therapeutic
activities geared towards both adults and children. Unlike most traditional holiday centres, which include a wide
range of entertainment and activities as part of the basic holiday package, forest village holiday providers offer a
customised approach and charge extra for individual activities. Furthermore, forest villages operate 365 days per
year, offering guests a high-quality experience under all types of weather through a wide range of indoor and
outdoor activities and amenities.

**Business Overview**

Center Parcs is a leading UK short-break holiday business, attracting over 2.1 million guests in the 52-week
period ended 27 February 2020. Center Parcs operates five specially constructed holiday villages in the United
Kingdom: Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Elveden Forest in Suffolk, Whinfell
Forest in Cumbria (the “Original Villages”) and Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire. Each village is set in a forest
environment amongst approximately 400 acres of forest around a lake and is open 365 days per year.

Woodland, water and a natural environment make up the essential environment of a Center Parcs break.
Within this comfortable, quiet, car-free and family-friendly setting, each of the Center Parcs villages provides guests
with high quality accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. In total, as of 31 December 2020, there
were 4,335 units of accommodation across its five villages, which could accommodate approximately 22,958 guests
per day at 100% occupancy. The focal point and key attraction of each village is an all-weather indoor sub-tropical
swimming paradise, featuring a selection of water activities including a wave pool, river slides and rides, children’s
pools and Jacuzzis. Center Parcs’ on-site experiences also include outdoor activities such as cycling, boating and zip
wires; indoor activities such as ten-pin bowling, badminton and pottery; and amenities such as spas, food and beverage
and retail. A significant proportion of Center Parcs’ revenue is generated from guests’ on-site spending, including for
leisure and spa activities, food and beverage and retail, representing 39.2% of total revenue in financial year 2020.

Center Parcs has a well-established brand in the UK, renowned for providing high quality experiences and
facilities, targeting a primary guest base of affluent families. Center Parcs benefits from strong guest loyalty with
approximately 34% of guests returning within 14 months and approximately 54% of guests returning over a five-year
period as of financial year 2020. In addition, Center Parcs believes that its business model is difficult to replicate due
to the lack of suitable locations for the development of holiday parks and high development costs while Center Parcs
is well positioned to continue to grow its business.

Center Parcs’ villages typically draw on a regional population of guests who are attracted to the convenience
of being within a relatively short driving distance from home. Over 90% of the UK population lives within a 2.5 hour
drive of at least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two hour drive of
the village they choose to visit. Center Parcs believes that the proximity of the majority of guests to its villages
combined with the easy accessibility of the villages by car make Center Parcs a popular and convenient short break
holiday option. Occupancy levels at Center Parcs’ villages have been consistently high: 97.6% in financial year 2018,
97.1% in financial year 2019, and 97.3% in the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. Occupancy levels have
averaged approximately 96% in the last 15 years to 27 February 2020, and approximately 97% in the last eight years
to 27 February 2020, despite the expansion of existing accommodation offerings at Center Parcs’ Original Villages

and the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014. However, as a result of village closures and occupancy restrictions in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall occupancy level at Center Parcs’ villages for the 36-week period
ended 31 December 2020 was 30.5%.

For the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, Center Parcs had revenue of £496.3 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of £239.4 million, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.2%.

In each of the financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have been
broadly evenly split amongst Center Parcs’ villages, reflecting both the individual strength of each village and the
diversity of Center Parcs’ asset base.

The map below shows the location of each of Center Parcs’ villages as of 31 December 2020.

With the exception of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have
consistently grown over the past ten years. Total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were £496.3 million and
£239.4 million, respectively, for the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. Adjusted EBITDA margins grew from
42.4% in financial year 2008 to 48.2% in the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020.

**History of the Center Parcs Group**

The Center Parcs concept was pioneered by Piet Derksen in the late 1960s in the Netherlands as a new form
of self-catering, high-comfort holiday village, complemented with heated bungalows, open fires, central heating,
colour TVs and covered swimming pools. Derksen expanded the chain over the course of the following two decades
into Belgium, France and Germany, and, in 1987, the first Center Parcs opened in the United Kingdom at Sherwood
Forest. The first British village was closely followed by a second at Elveden Forest in 1989. In 1994, Center Parcs

126


-----

further expanded with the creation of the third village, Longleat Forest, near Bath. In 2001, Center Parcs acquired the
Oasis Holiday Village (now called Whinfell Forest) in the northwest of England from the Bourne Leisure Group, thus
enhancing Center Parcs’ geographic footprint in the UK. In 2001, the continental European “Center Parcs” business
was separated from the United Kingdom “Center Parcs” business and the two have been under separate ownership
from that point onward. In November 2010, Center Parcs received reserved matters planning approval of its plan to
develop and build a fifth village situated near Woburn in Bedfordshire. The development of Woburn Forest
commenced in May 2012 and opened to guests in June 2014.

The Blackstone Funds bought the operating business in May 2006 and subsequently delisted it from the
London Stock Exchange where it had been listed on the AIM in 2003 and on the Main Market in 2005. Shortly
thereafter, Blackstone Funds purchased the property companies owning the four Original Villages in June 2006. In
August 2015, certain funds managed by affiliates of Brookfield Management Inc. (the “Brookfield Funds”) acquired
Center Parcs from the Blackstone Funds.

Since 2006, Center Parcs has implemented programmes to upgrade accommodation and to upgrade and
expand on-site offerings. In July 2019, Center Parcs opened its sixth village, Longford Forest, in County Longford,
Republic of Ireland. Longford Forest is Center Parcs’ first village outside of the United Kingdom. Longford Forest is
outside of the Obligor Group.

**Key Strengths**

**Unique, market-leading short break holiday business.**

Center Parcs believes that it provides a unique product in the UK holiday market in terms of scale, quality
and standard of accommodation and amenities. Each Center Parcs village is set in approximately 400 acres of forest
around a lake, with numerous retail and food and beverage offerings, as well as more than 150 leisure and spa related
activities and an indoor sub-tropical swimming paradise. Each village has on average 867 units of accommodation
with capacity for approximately 4,590 guests. Center Parcs believes that it is the only large-scale UK business offering
this type of high quality family-focused, year-round, all-weather, short-break package, in a forest environment. Center
Parcs believes that it is well-positioned to benefit from pent-up demand for domestic travel as a result of the COVID19 pandemic lasting for over a year, with its villages typically drawing on a regional population of guests who live
within a relatively short driving distance. In a recent customer survey of approximately 4,000 guests on 5 March 2021,
only 3% of respondents stated that they did not intend to take a domestic holiday or short break in the next twelve
months. Further, the design of Center Parcs’ villages lends itself well to social distancing, as most guests travel to the
villages in their own cars, the lodges provide for self-catering, the villages are spread out over a large open footprint
and many of the activities are outdoors.

**Difficult to replicate concept with well-known brand and loyal, affluent customer base.**

The Center Parcs villages are characterised by a number of qualities that Center Parcs believes make its
business model difficult to replicate in the United Kingdom. These include:

    - limited appropriate sites for villages, which require large forested areas near major population
centres;

    - long lead time needed to develop new villages due to the stringent requirements for obtaining
planning permits;

    - significant initial investment cost in addition to on-going capital expenditure required for further
development and operations of the business; and

    - a wide range of specialised operations and planning expertise required to develop and operate a
village.

Center Parcs’ unique product offering has generated strong brand recognition and guest loyalty. Center Parcs
believes that it has high brand recognition in the UK and is considered among the top brands for high quality short
breaks in the UK.

Center Parcs’ “intention to return” score was 95% in financial year 2020. Approximately 34% of Center
Parcs’ guests return within 14 months and approximately 54% return over a five-year period. Center Parcs’ active
marketable guest base was approximately 309,000 households in 2020.

In 2020, Aqua Sana Whinfell Forest was awarded Best Community Spa by Good Spa Awards. Aqua Sana
Longleat Forest and Aqua Sana Woburn Forest also won accolades from the Professional Beauty Awards, with Aqua
Sana Longleat Forest being awarded South West and Wales Spa of the Year and Large Spa of the Year, and Aqua
Sana Woburn Forest winning South East Spa of the Year. In 2019, three of Center Parcs’ Aqua Sana spas were
shortlisted for Good Spa Awards, and Aqua Sana Sherwood Forest was awarded Best Destination Spa in the UK.
Aqua Sana Sherwood Forest had previously been awarded Best Spa in the East Midlands and the East in November
2018.

Center Parcs’ guest profile has remained stable over time and consists of the highest earning categories of
the UK population. According to management estimates, Center Parcs ranked significantly over index in a number of
the Experian high end consumer classifications, with 57% of guests in financial year 2019 identified under the
Experian Mosaic classification as “Domestic Success”, “Prestige Positions” or “Aspiring Homemakers” based on
postcode analysis.

**Resilient growth through economic cycles.**

Resilient performance through economic cycles, during both downturns and recoveries, and also through
additions in capacity, has resulted in Center Parcs’ occupancy levels averaging over 90% over the last 20 years to
27 February 2020, approximately 96% in the last 15 years to 27 February 2020 and approximately 97% in the last
eight years to 27 February 2020, with occupancy levels of 97.6%, 97.1% and 97.3% in financial years 2018 and 2019
and the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, respectively. Occupancy at each of the villages has historically
remained high even after the opening of Woburn Forest in 2014 despite an approximately 20% increase in Center
Parcs’ accommodation available, demonstrating the depth of demand for Center Parcs’ villages. Despite the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic conditions as well as on guests’ willingness to travel, and the restrictions on
Center Parcs’ ability to operate at full capacity following the initial re-opening of the villages on 13 July 2020, demand
for Center Parcs’ villages remains resilient and is already exceeding expected operating capacity for some breaks. As
of 16 April 2021, bookings for financial year 2022 were 52.1% sold, including bookings that have been moved from
the Closure Periods, as compared to 41.6% of bookings for financial year 2020 as at the same point in April 2019 (and
36.2% in April 2020, which was impacted by COVID-19-related cancellations). Historically, at the end of each
financial year, approximately 40% of the bookings for Center Parcs’ villages for the following financial year have
been sold. Therefore, the current rate of bookings for financial year 2022 is ahead of Center Parcs’ historical
expectations.

High occupancy levels drive a significant proportion of revenue from guests’ on-site spending, which
represented 39.2% of Center Parcs’ total revenue in financial year 2020.

ADR on average also consistently grew above inflation between financial year 2008 and the 52-week period
ended 27 February 2020, at a CAGR of 3.6%. During this period, Center Parcs’ RevPAL growth was approximately
twice the growth in inflation and UK RevPAR during the period. The growth in Center Parcs’ ADR has been driven
by yield management initiatives, demand and on-site investment, including in new types of accommodation and
upgrades to existing accommodation.

The following table shows RevPAL and ADR for Center Parcs as compared to UK RevPAR and the CPI for
financial years 2008 to 2019 and the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020.

**Consistent revenue growth with strong visibility through forward-booking model.**

With the exception of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in financial years 2020 and 2021, Center Parcs
experienced revenue growth each year over the previous ten years, with revenue growing at a CAGR of 5.5% from
financial year 2008 to the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. In addition, Center Parcs’ Adjusted EBITDA has
grown at a CAGR of 6.6% from financial year 2008 to the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020. Center Parcs
places a strong emphasis on advance prepaid bookings, which result in significant revenue visibility, with an average
of 19 weeks’ booking-to-arrival time in financial years 2018 to 2020. For each of financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020,
an average of approximately 43% of the available accommodation nights had been booked by the beginning of the
financial year, an average of 59% by the end of the first quarter, an average of 76% halfway through the financial
year, and an average of 95% two months before the end of the financial year.

Under its standard terms and conditions, Center Parcs collects 30% of the accommodation cost at the time of
booking if completed more than ten weeks in advance of the short break. The balance of the cost is collected ten weeks
prior to the start of the break. If a guest books less than ten weeks prior to the arrival date, the accommodation cost is
payable in full on booking. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some changes have been made to these conditions,
but a reversion to standard terms and conditions is expected. Similarly, in the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020,
more than 64% of leisure and spa activities were pre-booked and pre-paid prior to arrival. This significant revenue
visibility allows Center Parcs to optimise its cost structure according to anticipated occupancy levels and demand
throughout the year.

**Sustainable cash flow generation.**

With the exception of the periods impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs’ EBITDA margins
have been underpinned by high occupancy levels and consistent growth in ADR. Relatively high EBITDA margins

129


-----

combined with the negative working capital characteristics of the business due to its forward-booking model and the
relatively low maintenance capital expenditure requirements, which averaged £21.1 million per financial year from
financial year 2008 to financial year 2020, has enabled Center Parcs to be highly cash generative, with cash conversion
(defined as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure plus working capital and non-cash movements
(less difference between the pension charge and contribution), expressed as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA) in
excess of 85% in each of financial years 2018 and 2019 and the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, at 94.1%,
91.2%, and 87.4%, respectively. In addition, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, all guests impacted by a closure
have had the option to change dates with £100 discount or cancel and claim a full refund. The £100 discount offer has
continued to see a high level of uptake, with over 50% of guests over the course of the most recent lockdown from 21
December 2020 to 11 April 2021 choosing this option rather than cancelling their booking. During the COVID-19
pandemic, Brookfield reiterated its commitment to Center Parcs through equity contributions of £120.0 million,
comprising £41.5 million received in April 2020, £27.5 million received in May 2020 and £51.0 million received in
February 2021 and the Intercompany Account Advance of £70 million received on 14 July 2020. These commitments
are part of a total of £230 million of financial support available to Center Parcs that has been approved by the
Brookfield funds, with the balance of £40 million available to Center Parcs and CP Ireland, if required.

**Well-invested, diversified and high-quality asset base.**

Center Parcs owns all five of its UK villages on either freehold titles or long leasehold titles, and with
remaining lease terms of between 53 years and 980 years, Center Parcs’ asset base has a long life and is diversified
and stable. In financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have been broadly
evenly split amongst its villages, located in different parts of the UK, reflecting both the individual strength of each
village and the diversity of Center Parcs’ asset base.

Center Parcs has an on-going capital expenditure programme to maintain and enhance the quality of its asset
base, pursuant to which it has invested approximately £724 million from financial year 2008 through financial year
2020. Of this investment, £279 million represents maintenance capital expenditures. The remainder represents
investment capital expenditure, of which £212 million was invested to upgrade existing accommodation, £100 million
was invested to build new developments, £116 million was invested in on-site development, including new leisure
activities, food and beverage offerings and facilities upgrades and £17 million was invested in its Digital Roadmap
project. In addition, Center Parcs incurred approximately £250 million of total initial development costs in respect of
building Woburn Forest.

Since the acquisition of Center Parcs by the Brookfield Funds in August 2015, the amount of total capital
expenditure has increased from £43 million (of which investment capital expenditure: £19 million) in financial year
2015 to £84.5 million (of which investment capital expenditure: £59 million), £66.1 million (of which investment
capital expenditure: £39 million) and £52.8 million (of which investment capital expenditure: £25 million) in financial
years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, reflecting Brookfield’s commitment to the business and focus on a range of
capital investment opportunities to further grow the business. In financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, the construction
of new build accommodation comprised approximately £25 million, £10 million and £6 million, respectively, of
investment capital expenditure, while a range of ongoing village refurbishments of accommodation, restaurants, retail
outlets, spas and other offerings and facilities comprised the remainder.

**Experienced management team with a track record of innovation.**

Center Parcs has an experienced management team with a proven ability to execute its business plans and
achieve results. In addition, Center Parcs’ management team has a track record of innovation reflected in its yield
management initiatives, innovation in on-site activities and food and beverage offerings, as well as development of
new types of accommodation to help drive ADR. In 2014, the management team successfully opened Woburn Forest
on time and on budget. With an average length of service of over 15 years by individual members of its management
team, the management team is highly experienced in providing the services that set Center Parcs apart from other UK
leisure and holiday providers. Center Parcs also benefits from the operational expertise, relationships, and
management experience of Brookfield.

**Strategy**

**Continue to grow revenue through yield management, flexible pricing, targeted marketing and customer**
**relationship management.**

Center Parcs actively manages pricing across its villages to maintain its high level of occupancy and to
optimise yield during periods of high demand. All bookings are made directly with Center Parcs, with approximately
87% of accommodation bookings made online in financial year 2020. Together with its strong emphasis on advance
bookings (average 19 weeks’ booking-to-arrival time period in financial years 2018 to 2020), this provides Center
Parcs with significant operational information, allowing it to respond quickly to customer trends in order to optimise
its pricing. Center Parcs will continue to operate a flexible pricing model to further grow revenue, and to develop its
customer relationship management initiatives to increase demand from the affluent families that form its core guest
base. Following the reopening of the villages on 12 April 2021, Center Parcs’ villages were operating at approximately
75% capacity as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Capacity levels will be reviewed in due course pursuant
to government guidelines and health and safety considerations, and Center Parcs is currently targeting a return to
nearly full capacity by the end of summer 2021.

Center Parcs’ guest database of approximately 309,000 active guests allows it to undertake targeted
marketing campaigns using a range of channels, including direct mailings, online and digital marketing, television
campaigns and email programmes focused on both existing customers and targeted acquisition of new affluent
families.

**Continue to invest in revenue-enhancing upgrades of Center Parcs accommodation offering and to expand**
**available capacity.**

Center Parcs plans to continue to invest in upgrading the accommodation and facilities in its villages, and to
introduce new accommodation and on-site activities. Since 2007, Center Parcs has opened over 230 new units of
accommodation at its Original Villages, and significantly upgraded all units of accommodation at the Original Villages
at an average estimated cost of approximately £50,000 per lodge. Following the upgrade of all existing units of
accommodation, Center Parcs has started a cycle of refurbishment for such accommodation which is important to
maintain quality and generate repeat business and 2,347 units of accommodation have been upgraded as of the date
of this Offering Memorandum.

There is also capacity for additional new builds of premium lodges at Center Parcs’ villages, which typically
achieve a premium over the rate achieved on standard lodges. Center Parcs believes that such premium lodges attract
affluent guests who are more likely to be high on-site spenders. Center Parcs currently has planning permission to
build a further 103 units of accommodation. The new units of accommodation are expected to include waterside
lodges, apartments and other executive lodges.

**Disciplined investment in village experience.**

Center Parcs believes that there are several substantial development projects that could profitably expand
Center Parcs’ offering, including Project Atlantis, which involves the strategic enhancement of the signature subtropical swimming paradise that features at each village. Center Parcs spent approximately £38 million between 2012
and 2020 on implementing Project Atlantis. Improvements included the addition of a new raft ride, the Tropical
Cyclone, and a new play area featuring numerous slides and water feature at Elveden Forest, Longleat Forest and
Sherwood Forest. Over the next two years, Center Parcs plans to make similar upgrades to the pool facilities at
Whinfell Forest. Center Parcs has also invested approximately £6.5 million in the refurbishment and expansion of the
Aqua Sana spa facility at Longleat Forest.

Center Parcs also intends to introduce new leisure activities at each village on a regular basis, as well as
innovate upon its existing offering of leisure activities. Development opportunities include introducing zip wires,
electric boats and expanding indoor climbing activities to all villages. Center Parcs believes that such investments
provide an enriched holiday experience particularly for the affluent families that form its core guest base, and that an
improved on-site unique offering helps to drive both accommodation and on-site revenue.

**Grow on-site spend.**

Center Parcs generated 40.3%, 39.5% and 39.2% of its total revenue from on-site spend in the financial years
2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. As Center Parcs’ guests typically remain on-site for the duration of their stay,
Center Parcs believes that there are opportunities to grow on-site spend further. For example, Center Parcs has

131


-----

continued to develop a programme of enhanced differentiation in pricing where prices of various offerings are
expected to become flexible across seasons, days of the week and times of day to more accurately reflect guest demand.

Center Parcs has franchise, licensing and concession agreements with various providers. These concession
partners enable guests to benefit from high street brand offerings and Center Parcs to increase profitability through
increased on-site spend. Center Parcs reviews these agreements periodically to ensure that they remain economically
attractive and meet its guests’ requirements.

**Continue to increase profitability through controlling costs.**

Center Parcs benefits from having a flexible cost base. Because of the high level of forward booking visibility
of the business, Center Parcs is typically able to manage its cost base effectively to meet its business requirements. As
part of the strategy to seek profitable growth, it intends to continue to generate cost savings through increased
efficiency at each village and at its head office.

During the closure of Center Parcs’ villages, Center Parcs ensured stringent cost controls and implemented
strict cash management procedures to conserve liquidity, including the rephasing of capital investment projects and
cessation of non-essential operating activities. Center Parcs reduced capital expenditure by ceasing and rephasing nonessential capital projects as closures were announced. Center Parcs estimates that approximately 37.5% of its total
capital expenditure has been rephased for financial year 2021. In addition, Center Parcs also participated in a number
of UK government support measures for businesses to reduce the impact of the closures on its liquidity. Center Parcs
deferred VAT payments and furloughed up to 90% of its employees in accordance with the UK government’s CJRS
scheme. Center Parcs also utilised the 12-month business rates holiday available to retail, hospitality and leisure
businesses and expects to utilise the further 3-month business rates holiday from April 2021 to June 2021, and the
maximum £2.0 million of business rate relief from July onwards. Together, these actions reduced operating expenses
by approximately £14 million on average per four-week period, or approximately 70%, to approximately £6 to £7
million on average per four-week period from 24 April 2020 to 18 June 2020 and 21 December 2020 to 25 February
2021, representing a closed period, as compared to approximately £20 million on average per four-week period from
26 April 2019 to 27 February 2020, representing a typical operating period. Operating expenses gradually increased
in the lead up to the re-opening of the villages on 12 April 2021.

Following the reopening of Center Parcs’ villages on 12 April 2021, Center Parcs expects to continue to
focus on cost efficiency and optimisation while complying with new regulations and ensuring the safety of its guests
and employees. Center Parcs expects its operating costs to be higher in the short-term due to the implementation of
additional health and safety procedures pursuant to government guidelines related to COVID-19.

**Business Description**

**Product Offering**

Center Parcs’ focus is on the short-break holiday market. Center Parcs’ guests can choose from three predefined break durations: the weekend (Friday to Monday), mid-week (Monday to Friday) or a week (Friday to Friday
or Monday to Monday, comprised of a weekend break and mid-week break). Guests can also book combinations of
these breaks. Accommodation is charged on a per-break rather than per-sleeper or per-night basis (with the exception
of the spa suites which are sold on a per-night basis). Approximately 96% of holidays booked in the 52-week period
ended 27 February 2020 and in financial year 2020, with the exception of spa breaks, spa suites and corporate
bookings, were for three or four night breaks.

Although located near urban centres, Center Parcs villages are each set within approximately 400 acres of
forest around a lake and offer year-round, all-weather holidays in a car-free natural environment.

Center Parcs generated 59.7%, 60.5%, and 60.8% of its total revenue from accommodation in financial years
2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. For the 36-week period ended 31 December 2020 and the 36-week period ended
2 January 2020, Center Parcs generated approximately 69.0% and 61.8% of its revenue from accommodation
respectively. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in March 2020, Center Parcs’ occupancy
rates have averaged approximately 96% in the last 15 years. As of 16 April 2021, bookings for financial year 2022
were 52.1% sold, including bookings that have been moved from the Closure Periods as compared to 41.6% of
bookings for financial year 2020 as at the same point in April 2019 (and 36.2% in April 2020, which was impacted
by COVID-19-related cancellations). Historically, at the end of each financial year, approximately 40% of the
bookings for Center Parcs’ villages for the following financial year have been sold. Therefore, the current rate of
bookings for financial year 2022 is ahead of Center Parcs’ historical expectations.

Each village offers more than 150 leisure and spa related activities, along with on average 16 bars and
restaurants and 5 shops. Center Parcs generated 40.3%, 39.5% and 39.2% of its total revenue from on-site spend in
financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The proportion of revenue from on-site spend in the 52-week
periods ended 27 February 2020 and 28 February 2019 was broadly consistent with that in financial years 2018, 2019
and 2020.

**Accommodation**

Accommodation is a critical part of the overall guest experience at Center Parcs and the key financial driver,
representing 60.5% of total revenue, or £290.6 million, in financial year 2019 and 60.8% of total revenue, or
£269.9 million, in financial year 2020. As of 31 December 2020, Center Parcs offered 4,335 units of accommodation
across its five villages. Investment, maintenance and refurbishment are on-going to keep all accommodation up to
date, fresh and contemporary.

Accommodation at each village comprises a range of one to four bedroom lodges (with six-bedroom lodges
at Sherwood Forest, Whinfell Forest and Woburn Forest), and luxury spa suits, one and two bedroom apartments and
hotel rooms, some of which include self-catering facilities. Each village offers a range of different grades of
accommodation, from entry level woodland units to exclusive lodges and treehouses with Jacuzzis, steam rooms and
an assortment of premium facilities, as well as a small number of apartments and hotel rooms. Center Parcs recently
completed the upgrade of all of its accommodation at the Original Villages and, following the upgrade of all existing
units of accommodation, Center Parcs has started a new cycle of refurbishment. 2,347 units of accommodation have
been upgraded as of the date of this Offering Memorandum under the current refurbishment cycle.

Between financial years 2007 and 2020, Center Parcs added over 230 new units of accommodation at the
Original Villages, in addition to the 706 units of accommodation added when Woburn Forest opened in 2014 together
with 92 additional units at Woburn Forest following its opening. In addition, Center Parcs has planning permission to

The Sub-tropical swimming paradise is the core leisure offer of each Center Parcs village and is free to guests.
The pools are heated all year and have slides, water playgrounds for toddlers and a variety of other features, such as
family raft rides at Elveden Forest, Sherwood Forest and Woburn Forest. Across the five villages, the indoor water
park averages over 5,500 square metres in size, with an average capacity of over 1,400 people in the pool and changing
areas. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, the pool areas are not available for guests to use. Center Parcs

additional activities are also available for a surcharge, including scuba diving and aqua jetting. Guests can also hire a
private cabana with seating, a television and complimentary soft drinks.

In 2011, Center Parcs commenced Project Atlantis, a strategic enhancement of its pool offer. The review
covers facility maintenance as well as opportunities to add new features. Project Atlantis is an investment capital
expenditure program pursuant to which approximately £38 million was spent between 2012 and 2020 at the Original
Villages in order to enhance the offering and guest experience. In autumn 2012, a new raft ride, the Tropical Cyclone,
was introduced at Elveden Forest and in June 2013, a family play area including numerous slides and water features
was also opened at Elveden Forest. These concepts, including high adrenaline raft rides and water slides, were included
at Woburn Forest upon its opening in 2014 and extended to Longleat Forest in August 2017 and Sherwood Forest in
2019. The extension at Sherwood Forest includes two new raft rides in addition to a new children’s play area.

**Outdoor Activities**

Outdoor activities offered by Center Parcs vary from adventure golf and nature walks to high adrenaline
activities such as high ropes, tree trekking and zip wires. All villages have a lake which offers a wide range of water
sports and boats for hire, including electric boats. All villages also provide access to a boathouse and beach, where
paddle boats and activities such as canoeing and sailing are on offer. All the villages have an outdoor activity centre
providing activities such as Segways®, archery, quad biking and laser combat. Sherwood Forest and Whinfell Forest
also have nature centres which allow guests to learn about the village’s wildlife as well as provide activities such as
falconry, woodland walks and educational tours. Center Parcs also offers festive-themed activities from November
through the Christmas period as villages are transformed into “Winter Wonderland”. Center Parcs’ focus on capacity
management has enabled extra sessions for guests, further increasing profitability. New outdoor activities recently
introduced include zip wires, mini tree trekking for younger children, woodland wheelers, off road explorers, a vertical
drop challenge “The Drop”, an inflatable “Aqua Parc” and a children’s boating experience “Mini Captain’s
Adventure”.

**Indoor Activities**

Indoor activities include traditional activities, such as badminton, ten pin bowling, snooker, pool and table
tennis, all of which are consistently popular with guests and accordingly, have generated consistent revenue streams.
Access to a gymnasium and arcade are also available across all villages. Classes are offered for activities such as
fencing and climbing. Pottery painting was introduced initially at Longleat Forest in 2010 and has been rolled out to
all villages. It caters to all age groups and is a popular activity which has seen significant revenue growth. Certain
indoor activities are not available to guests as of Center Parcs’ reopening on 12 April 2021. The availability of indoor
activities will continue to be reviewed in line with the broader planned changes in the UK Government’s 4-step plan
to easing restrictions.

and Woburn Forest and one location at each other village.

teenagers. In addition to the “Activity Den”, classes for younger guests are offered in sports including football and
cricket. Roller skating and junior archery are also popular.

**Cycle Hire**

The car-free environment makes cycling a key feature of the Center Parcs experience. Each village has a fleet
of cycles. Center Parcs reviews its fleet regularly and invests significantly in new ranges of cycles to replace older
models. In line with the initiative to pre-book more activities, pre-booking of cycles represented more than half of
total cycle bookings in financial year 2018, reducing queuing times and improving planning.

**Aqua Sana — Spa and Treatments**

The award-winning Aqua Sana spa is open to outside guests as well as to village guests, with most bookings
made in advance and pre-paid prior to arrival. Aqua Sana comprised 5.6% of total revenue and 14.2% of total on-site
revenue, or £26.9 million, in financial year 2019 and comprised 5.7% of total revenue and 14.6% of total on-site
revenue, or £25.4 million, in financial year 2020.

Each village has between 15 and 25 treatment rooms and extensive spa facilities with a variety of different
“experience rooms”, hydrotherapy pools, saunas and meditation areas. Treatments range from massage through to
more advanced facials and beauty treatments for both men and women.

Aqua Sana facilities have benefited from on-going refurbishment and upgrades, with approximately
£7.4 million invested in the last three financial years. Retail shops offer a wide variety of beauty products from wellknown brands, including Elemis and Decleor. The Aqua Sana offer at all villages includes a “Vitalé Café Bar” food
and beverage offer serving light meals and refreshments. In 2017, Center Parcs launched the refurbished Aqua Sana
spa with a total capital expenditure of more than £3 million. In January 2020, Center Parcs completed a £6.5 million
upgrade of the Aqua Sana spa in Longleat Forest. In 2020, Aqua Sana Whinfell Forest was awarded Best Community
Spa by Good Spa Awards. Aqua Sana Longleat Forest and Aqua Sana Woburn Forest also won accolades from the
Professional Beauty Awards, with Aqua Sana Longleat Forest being awarded South West and Wales Spa of the Year
and Large Spa of the Year, and Aqua Sana Woburn Forest winning South East Spa of the Year. The Aqua Sana spas
at Whinfell Forest, Woburn Forest and Sherwood Forest were shortlisted for the 2019 Good Spa Awards, and Aqua
Sana Sherwood Forest was awarded Best Destination Spa in November 2019. Aqua Sana Sherwood Forest had
previously been awarded Best Spa in the East Midlands and the East in November 2018.

A new concept of spa suites was introduced at Elveden Forest in 2011. They provide a package of an
overnight stay combined with access to the Aqua Sana. Four units were opened and unlike other accommodation can
be booked on a nightly basis. Woburn Forest opened with six spa suite units and a further two have been subsequently
added.

Revenue from outside guests has been an area of growth, comprising 43% of Aqua Sana revenue in financial
year 2020. The business continues to work towards ensuring the right offer for both village guests and outside guests.

Online booking is available for Aqua Sana and a new website was introduced in December 2016. Aqua Sana
receives dedicated operational and sales and marketing support. Center Parcs will continue to refurbish and upgrade
facilities and invest in system enhancements at the Aqua Sana spas.

**Conference Facilities**

Sherwood Forest, Elveden Forest, Longleat Forest and Woburn Forest offer purpose built conference and
meeting facilities. Woburn Forest provides the largest conference facilities and can accommodate up to 400 delegates.
Each of the villages offers an extensive range of leisure activities, which can be used during conferences for
teambuilding purposes, such as raft building, tree trekking or aerial adventures. The use of these conference and
meeting facilities are booked through Center Parcs’ Corporate Events division. Following the re-opening of Center
Parcs’ villages on 12 April 2021, Center Parcs is hopeful that corporate events can re-commence before the end of
calendar year 2021.

**On-site Food and Beverage**

Center Parcs seeks to provide its guests with an extensive range of dining experiences, with on-site food and
beverage sales comprising 16.3% of total revenue and 41.3% of total on-site revenue, or £78.2 million, in financial
year 2019 and comprising 16.3% of total revenue and 41.7% of total on-site revenue, or £72.5 million, in financial
year 2020.

Each village has an average of 15 restaurants and bars. This provides a choice of restaurants, some targeted
at families, with play areas and children’s menus while others offer premium dining. Center Parcs believes that these

136


-----

on-site food and beverage facilities are popular with its guests and have enabled higher sustained pricing and limited
promotional activity compared with restaurants located on high streets. Menus are reviewed regularly and restaurants
have been refurbished and upgraded on a rolling cycle to ensure that standards and the experience are maintained to a
high standard. In financial years 2016 to 2020, Center Parcs carried out major refurbishments at “Sports Café” at
Sherwood Forest, Whinfell Forest, Longleat Forest and Elveden Forest, “Leisure Bowl” at Longleat Forest and
Elveden Forest and “Huck’s” at Sherwood Forest, Elveden Forest, Longleat Forest and Whinfell Forest and “Rajinda
Pradesh” at Whinfell Forest.

Concession partners operate certain outlets and account for approximately one third of on-site spend on food
and beverage. Approximately one-sixth of the outlets are operated under a concession agreement with The Big Table
Group. Under this concession agreement, the concession fees payable by The Big Table Group to Center Parcs is the
greater of a set minimum fee or a specified percentage of their respective revenue. Revenue generated by The Big
Table Group prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was above the minimum guaranteed. During the Closure Periods, rents
payable under concession agreements were not enforced. Since the reopening on 12 April 2021, rents payable under
concession agreements have been reduced given the restricted capacity of the villages but will be increased over time
as the capacity of the villages increases. Concession partners bring industry operational expertise to Center Parcs and
have brought high street brand names such as Café Rouge, Las Iguanas, Strada and Bella Italia to the villages.

The food and beverage offer includes the following:

    - Starbucks is operated as a franchise in all villages under licence, with 13 units in operation as of the
date of this Offering Memorandum;

its guests. Each village has an average of five main retail outlets and a number of satellite retail offers. Center Parcs
has also recently signed an agreement with Joules for retail shops to be opened at each of Center Parcs’ sites. Joules’

137


-----

retail shops were first opened at Woburn Village on 12 April 2021, with retail shops at Center Parcs’ other villages
scheduled to be opened thereafter.

The on-site supermarket, the ParcMarket, provides guests with a full range of products comparable to a high
street convenience store for guests’ self-catering requirements. The shop includes a range of fresh foods, fresh breads
and pastries baked on-site, and a wide range of wines, beers and spirits as well as a comprehensive grocery offer.
Prices are monitored against comparably sized outlets in the surrounding areas.

Each village also has a confectionery shop, a gift shop with a wide variety of gifts and souvenirs and a toy
store catering for children of all ages. There is also a shop within the cycle centre.

Since 2008, the World Duty Free Group (formerly known as the Nuance Group) has been Center Parcs’
strategic retail partner. The World Duty Free Group’s management of these retail units has allowed Center Parcs to
develop a partnership with an operator with a well-established retail network. The presence of the concession partners
enables guests to benefit from high street brand offerings and Center Parcs to leverage industry expertise.
Approximately 40% of all retail shops at Center Parcs are currently operated under concession agreements with the
World Duty Free Group.

every five years. Rent reviews are upwards only but limited by reference to revenue increase relative to whichever of
the preceding review periods has the greatest revenue. The remainder of the property (an outdoor activity centre) at
Longleat Forest is held under a lease between The Most Honourable Alexander George Seventh Marquis of Bath,
including his heirs and successors, and Longleat Property Limited. The term of this lease is 64 years, one month and
25 days from 1 January 2009 to 25 February 2073 for a current passing rent of £20,000 per annum. This lease is
subject to a rent review mechanism on similar terms as the above-mentioned two underleases.

**Whinfell Forest**

Whinfell Forest was initially built by Rank and opened in 1997. It was subsequently sold to Bourne Leisure
and then acquired by Center Parcs in 2001. Whinfell Forest comprises approximately 415 acres of land and is home
to one of the UK’s last remaining colonies of red squirrels, which can be seen regularly throughout the village. In
financial year 2019, Whinfell Forest generated £91 million in revenue and £47 million Adjusted EBITDA. In financial
year 2020, Whinfell Forest generated £85 million in revenue and £41 million Adjusted EBITDA.

**Location**

The property is located between Penrith and Temple Sowerby on the A66. Penrith is the closest town
(population approximately 15,000) and is approximately four miles west of the village.

**Transport Links**

The M6 motorway is approximately seven miles to the west of the village, providing motorway access to
Scotland and the northwest of England, as well as to the Midlands and the south of England. The closest rail facilities
are located in Penrith, which provides connections to major centres, including Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester,
Birmingham and London.

**Catchment Area**

Whinfell Forest is the most northerly of the Center Parcs’ villages and it therefore tends to attract guests from
Scotland, the north of England and north Wales. The main catchment areas include Glasgow and the west coast of
Scotland, Newcastle and the north east, Liverpool, Manchester and the North West. However, due to the proximity of
the village to the Lake District, this facility also has a higher proportion of long distance guests.

**Tenure**

The property is held under three separate titles - one being freehold and two being long leasehold. The
leasehold titles are held under two leases scheduled to expire in 2120 for a total passing rental of £1,000 per annum.
A premium of £3,288,500 (plus VAT) was previously paid in instalments for one lease, and a premium of £112,000
was paid in respect of the other lease.

**Woburn Forest**

The fifth village in Center Parcs’ portfolio comprises approximately 357 acres of mature forested land in
Woburn, Bedfordshire and was opened to paying guests on 6 June 2014. Woburn Forest was built with the same core
offer as the Original Villages but introduced modern and contemporary accommodation designs and has a higher
proportion of premium accommodation offerings. As of 31 December 2020, Woburn Forest had 800 units of
accommodation comprising 717 lodges, a 75 room hotel and 8 spa suites. There are 415 units of executive
accommodation, representing 52.0% of the total, a higher percentage than any other village. This is designed to service
the anticipated demand of its affluent guest base in the south of England.

As part of a further development phase, 57 additional premium and executive lodges opened in autumn 2017,
three treehouses opened in July 2018, 12 lodges opened during financial year 2020 and two lodges opened during
financial year 2021.

In financial year 2019, Woburn Forest generated £95 million in revenue and £50 million Adjusted EBITDA.
In financial year 2020, Woburn Forest generated £87 million in revenue and £42 million Adjusted EBITDA.

**Location**

Woburn Forest is located approximately 60 miles north of London in Bedfordshire.

**Transport Links**

Woburn Forest is six miles from the M1 motorway. The village also has convenient rail links, with a journey
time of 45 minutes by train from London St. Pancras to Flitwick train station, located approximately two miles away.

**Catchment Area**

Woburn Forest is the only Center Parcs village within a 90-minute drive time of London households. Woburn
Forest also has the highest volume of core target households within that drive time. For much of this population, the
penetration for Center Parcs has historically been low.

**Tenure**

The property is held in leasehold title under the terms of a lease with Woburn Estate Company Limited and
Bedford Estates Nominees Limited. The term of the lease is 99 years from 24 December 2010 for a current passing
rent of £641,412 (payable from March 2018) per annum. A premium of £3,540,600 was paid to the lessor. The lease
contains a rent review clause with an upwards only review to take place every 5 years (with the next review due on

141


-----

31 March 2023) by reference to the greater of an increase in rent in line with the retail price index, a fixed percentage
increase in the passing rent or the historic increase in revenue at Woburn Forest.

**Village Development**

The first step in the development of a new Center Parcs village is the identification of an appropriate site.
There are limited appropriate sites for villages as the Center Parcs’ model requires large forested areas near major
population centres. Following the identification of the site, planning permits for the development of the village need
to be obtained. The development of a new village has a long lead time due to the stringent requirements for these
permits. In addition, a wide range of specialised operations and planning expertise are required to develop a new
village, including cost plans and budgets as well as studies assessing the economic, geological and ecological impact
of the new village. The planning phase is followed by tender and procurement processes for the construction. These
processes are then followed by the actual construction and pre-opening training of village staff. From time to time,
Center Parcs evaluates suitable locations for new villages to develop or acquire and is currently finalising negotiations
for an option agreement for a potential sixth site in the UK.

There are significant costs associated with the development of a village. For example, the development cost
for Woburn Phase 1 was approximately £250 million. The actual building of the village involved the construction of
706 units of accommodation in addition to the Village Square, the Indoor Plaza, the Subtropical Swimming Paradise
and other activity and leisure areas. Center Parcs estimates that the current cost of developing a new village would be
approximately £350 million.

In July 2019, Center Parcs opened its sixth village, Longford Forest, in County Longford in the Republic of
Ireland. Longford Forest is Center Parcs’ first village outside of the United Kingdom. Longford Forest is outside of
the Obligor Group. The 400-acre Longford Forest village includes 466 lodges and 30 apartments, which can
accommodate approximately 2,700 guests, more than 100 indoor and outdoor family activities including the
Subtropical Swimming Paradise and the Aqua Sana spa and a range of restaurants and shops. The development of
Longford Forest cost approximately €265 million. Center Parcs believes the development of Longford Forest resulted
in the creation of approximately 750 jobs during the construction and approximately 1,000 permanent jobs after
Longford Forest’s opening.

**Village Operations**

**Operational Management**

Each of Center Parcs’ villages is managed by a Village Director and a deputy Village Director, who oversee
the events manager, guest services manager and on-village revenue manager. Other individuals responsible for the
management of the village are the technical services manager, housekeeping manager, leisure services manager,
village financial controller, human resources manager, security manager, village duty managers and food and beverage
manager. As of 26 March 2021, Center Parcs had an average of approximately 1,480 employees at each village. Center
Parcs’ villages are akin to small towns with their own infrastructure, including gas, water and power provision.

One of the key focus points of village operations is guest satisfaction. 96% of guests rated their break as
“excellent” or “good” in financial year 2020. Center Parcs uses the “Delivering Excellent Service” metric to measure
service provision across offerings. Guest feedback, particularly the monitoring of “Delivering Excellent Service”
scores through guest surveys, forms a central part of the internal review and improvement process for each village.
Each operating unit at a village has target “Delivering Excellent Service” scores as part of its bonus schemes.

**Risk Management**

Each village’s Village Director is supported by an independent health and safety team at the head office.
Each village has regular risk meetings throughout the year. Center Parcs’ risk management policy focuses on health
and safety including guest safety, food safety, lodge safety, employee safety, fire safety and child protection. Center
Parcs also centrally monitors enterprise risk and key performance indicators.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs has taken extensive steps to mitigate the risk of
infection, including social distancing and enhanced cleaning measures, and remains focused on keeping guests and
employees safe and ensuring Center Parcs’ compliance with UK government health and safety regulations. Center
Parcs expects to undertake ongoing risk management and compliance efforts as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.

-----

**Supply Chain**

Center Parcs primarily has a centralised procurement function to ensure quality, competitiveness, regulatory
and ethical policy compliance, continuity and consistency across its five villages. Center Parcs mainly uses national
suppliers that service all five villages, ensuring economies of scale and commercial leverage, and therefore controlling
overall costs. Center Parcs’ villages also use local suppliers for certain goods and services to ensure provenance and
speed of service as well as to support corporate social responsibility initiatives. Altogether, Center Parcs manages
approximately 1,400 suppliers centrally and purchased approximately £154 million of goods and services in financial
year 2020. Center Parcs has a dedicated sourcing team focusing on utilities, food and beverage, fixtures, fittings and
inventory, technical and ground services, laundry services and leisure goods and services.

**Guest Profile**

Over 90% of the UK population lives within a 2.5 hour drive of at least one of Center Parcs’ villages, and
the majority of Center Parcs’ guests live within a two hour drive of the village they choose to visit.

In the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, 80% of Center Parcs’ guests were families, with families
with pre-school children, families with school age children and families with mixed age children comprising 31%,
28% and 21% of all guests, respectively.

According to management estimates, Center Parcs ranked significantly over index in a number of the
Experian high end consumer classifications, with 57% of guests in financial year 2019 identified under the Experian
Mosaic classification as “Domestic Success”, “Prestige Positions” or “Aspiring Homemakers” based on postcode
analysis.

**Marketing**

Center Parcs is positioned as a relatively upmarket, high quality short-break holiday option for affluent
families wanting to spend time together, away from the stresses and routine of everyday life. Brand value and integrity
underlies Center Parcs’ marketing strategy.

Center Parcs engages directly with guests, with approximately 87% of bookings made online in financial
year 2020 and the remaining through its in-house contact centre. Center Parcs does not deal with online affiliates or
travel agents. As such, there are no commission payments made to third parties selling Center Parcs to consumers.

Center Parcs’ accommodation pricing strategy is based on a dynamic demand driven model, where prices
start at a low level in order to generate demand and generally rise as sales increase along with demand as the shortbreak holiday dates approach. This approach rewards and encourages early booking (Center Parcs has an 18-month
booking horizon) and has helped Center Parcs increase revenues through economic cycles and has allowed it to
maintain and improve occupancy rates. This is reflected in “intention to return” scores of 95% in financial year 2020.

The dynamic demand-driven pricing model, overseen by its dedicated pricing team, enables management to
optimise accommodation revenues by linking price to demand throughout the year. The pricing model utilises granular
data, mapping holidays by length of break, accommodation type (with over 180 different types across the villages for
the purposes of the pricing model), time of year as well as by village and incorporates the previous year’s average
price as a base, adjusted for inflation and other factors (including the time of week, whether the period is peak or offpeak and high occupancy versus quieter occupancy periods). This allows Center Parcs to smooth out its pricing across
the seasons, adapt its accommodation pricing to guest demand and facilitate its yield management. Prices are reviewed
daily and any changes can be updated on the Center Parcs website within 30 minutes. Any prices can be benchmarked
against other villages, to adapt the progression of bookings against the expected booking profile.

Center Parcs’ on-site pricing is generally less variable than its accommodation pricing. All activities except
for the Subtropical Swimming Paradise are booked on a pay-per-use principle, and all activities are available for prebooking. In the 52-week period ended 27 February 2020, more than 64% of on-site activities were pre-booked and
pre-paid. Center Parcs maintains clear price lists for its activities to increase transparency.

Center Parcs maintains a guest database of approximately 309,000 active guests as of 31 December 2020 (i.e.
those who had a Center Parcs break in the last 26 months or have an active booking). Over 34% of guests return within
14 months, and approximately 54% of guests return within five years as of financial year 2020. Given the cost
effectiveness of targeting guests who have previously stayed at a Center Parcs village, a significant proportion of the
Center Parcs marketing budget is focused on communicating with its existing guest base, targeting repeat visits and
the sale of on-site activities. When making a booking all guests create a Center Parcs account, which allows them to

143


-----

store their information and party details and simplify their ongoing booking process with Center Parcs. This is also an
opportunity for Center Parcs to track and analyse data for insight over time. The retention strategy focuses on an email
programme that maintains communication with guests, from initial enquiry for information, through booking of
accommodation, pre-arrival booking of activities, to the post-visit Welcome Home and Anniversary emails.
Constantly evolving communications methods in line with consumer behaviour, Center Parcs are moving to eradicate
paper communications. Recently the Village Life magazine was moved to an online digital communication rather than
paper, with content complementing the ongoing lifestyle blog, “Under The Treetops”. A series of pre-arrival emails
to guests encourages them to plan and book their itinerary of activities and restaurant bookings well in advance and,
again, this has moved to be purely via digital channels. In addition, Center Parcs constantly monitors on-going guest
feedback through its online guest service questionnaire, which has been completed by approximately 33% of guests
in financial year 2020, as well as through various quantitative and qualitative research projects (including surveys and
focus groups), website behavioural tracking and social media reporting and monitoring to review the various elements
of its business. Guest questionnaires are also exclusively online delivering industry-leading response percentages and
therefore rich guest feedback. Such research helps guide marketing communications, and has also been the basis of
improvements in both guest service and product development (for example, accommodation refurbishment, pool
upgrades, new leisure activities and software developments). Center Parcs also offers a “come back soon” price
guarantee to guests when they leave thus incentivising guests to return and quickly rebook within a month of their
visit.

In addition to its retention strategy, Center Parcs integrates acquisition marketing activities across a mix of
available marketing channels such as TV, radio, web, email, newspapers and magazines, outdoor and social media,
all aimed primarily towards a more affluent market to bring in new affluent guests that have the potential to provide
repeat business and good lifetime value through multiple return visits. Typically, Center Parcs runs an integrated crosschannel media campaign, led by television and internet advertising and search, supplemented by email, social media
and other forms of public relations activities, all of which are seasonally, geographically and demographically targeted
for optimal effects. The largest spend of the year is focused upon the key booking period from late December through
to late February, when large numbers of UK consumers are in the market for holidays and short-breaks and the
propensity to book is higher.

Center Parcs operates a service programme called “Delivering Excellent Service” to enhance the level of
service it provides to its guests. All staff have been trained under the Making Memorable Moments Programme. This
effort has yielded improved results, as measured by responses to guest questionnaires.

**Information Technology**

Center Parcs’ has a modern information technology platform utilising proprietary and third-party hardware
and software, including market-standard booking and customer relationship management tools, firewalls and data
protection mechanisms, off-site servers, and dedicated on-site IT staff. Center Parcs uses price variability between
seasons and across villages in order to respond to changes in demand, local economic conditions, and guest spending
profiles.

Center Parcs maintains a sophisticated customer database with fully integrated accommodation and on-site
spend data, designed to improve customer analytics, full social media and customer relationship management and a
robust online platform recognising individuals and profile segments. As a result, Center Parcs is building the future
opportunity to (i) improve its ability to identify and target the most profitable guest profiles and customer lifetime
value; (ii) develop and facilitate access to guest data for guest-facing service departments and provide more targeted
guest services, such as differentiating between first-time guests and repeat guests and recognising differing family
make ups, such as children’s ages; (iii) boost individual guest identification indicating individual preferences to enable
Center Parcs to better tailor guest services; and (iv) allow for an improved user booking experience by providing a
seamless, consistent and more responsive process across its booking systems.

**Bookings Systems**

Center Parcs’ pre-arrivals booking systems comprise a telephone-based in-house contact centre and an online
service via its website. Center Parcs significantly improved cost efficiency and efficiency of email and call handling
through the consolidation of its call centre operations to its head office in 2010. Guests are able to book leisure
activities in advance through these booking systems. In addition to benefiting guests, these pre-arrivals booking
systems help optimise yield management and give Center Parcs greater planning time to ensure it meets demand
through extra sessions/capacity. A dedicated revenue management team ensures that accommodation demand and

144


-----

capacity are constantly monitored to ensure revenue optimisation. In financial year 2020, more than 64% of activities
were pre-booked and pre-paid prior to arrival. All bookings are made directly with Center Parcs, with approximately
87% of accommodation bookings made online in financial year 2020. Guests can book either online (using Center
Parcs’ website or mobile site) or on-site using purpose built on-site booking points.

(1) As of 23 April 2020, approximately 90% of Center Parcs employees were furloughed pursuant to the UK government’s CJRS.

As of 26 March 2021, 42% of the Group’s employees were housekeepers, 20% of employees were employed
in leisure activities and 24% of employees were employed in food and beverage outlets.

Center Parcs is a large local employer in the locations where it operates and its strong brand awareness helps
it attract new employees. Center Parcs uses a centralised online recruitment system, in addition to references from
current employees. All new employees go through an induction programme that introduces them to Center Parcs’
customer service initiatives. Employees also have access to on-the-job training including a management training
course for employees looking to transition into management roles. Center Parcs also offers apprenticeships, diploma
courses and over 200 technical and professional courses each year to its employees.

**Maintenance and Inspection**

Center Parcs uses both planned preventative maintenance and reactive maintenance regimes to ensure that
its accommodation, facilities, amenities, plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings are inspected and maintained to a
standard acceptable to its target guest base.

The planned preventative maintenance regime helps to ensure that Center Parcs has visibility of the total cost
of maintaining its assets and the cost of replacing end of life assets. The reactive maintenance regime ensures that
Center Parcs has a technical services team on call to attend to any maintenance issue 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
The technical services teams are complimented by external experts, technicians and engineers as required.

The Director of Operations and the senior management team of each village meet regularly. The Director of
Operations and CEO undertake an annual inspection of standards and maintenance related issues and there is an annual
asset review undertaken with the CEO, Development Director, Head of Assets, Director of Operations and Village
Director.

**Insurance**

Center Parcs maintains insurance of the types it believes to be commercially reasonable and available to
businesses in its industry, and in amounts exceeding the statutory minimums. It maintains insurance policies that
provide coverage for property related risks, business interruption following loss of or damage to property, employers’
liability and public and product liability.

Center Parcs’ current insurance policies expire on 30 June of each year. While insurance premiums have
remained relatively stable over recent years, Center Parcs expects its insurance premiums to increase materially as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those for directors and officers insurance, public liability insurance,
employers’ liability insurance and travel insurance. Center Parcs cannot predict the level of the premiums it may be
required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage or the level of insurance available.

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, Center Parcs has been and is involved in disputes and litigation related to its business and
operations.

In particular, the nature of the leisure activities which it provides and the industry in which it operates tend
to expose Center Parcs to claims by guests for personal injuries. Center Parcs investigates such claims thoroughly and,
depending on the circumstances, will settle or defend the claim accordingly. Center Parcs may also be subject to
investigations and prosecution for alleged violations of health and safety laws and regulations. For example, Center
Parcs was party to proceedings involving an alleged health and safety violation in connection with an employee injured
on site at Woburn Forest in 2014. In March 2018, Center Parcs was party to proceedings involving an alleged health

146


-----

and safety violation in connection with a guest’s injury at Woburn Forest in 2015. As of 13 July 2020, these disputes
have been resolved and related costs paid.

Center Parcs is not currently party to any actual or threatened legal proceedings or disputes which may have
a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.

**Regulation and Environment**

The villages operated by Center Parcs are subject to a number of national and local laws relating to the
operation of holiday breaks, including those regarding the sale of alcohol and offering of entertainment. Operating in
forested areas with endangered wildlife, the villages are also required to adhere to strict environmental codes.

Center Parcs’ operations are subject to increasingly stringent national and local environmental laws and
regulations, including laws and regulations governing air and noise emissions; wastewater and storm water discharges
and uses; oil spillages; the maintenance of storage tanks and the use, release, storage, disposal, handling and
transportation of, and exposure to, chemicals and hazardous substances; and otherwise relating to health, safety and
the protection of the environment and natural resources and the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater.
Center Parcs achieved its previous carbon reduction target of a 20% reduction by 2020 ahead of schedule and is now
setting a new target to achieve further reductions by 2030.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Center Parcs’ operations have been and may continue to be subject
to additional regulations, including health and safety requirements such as required social distancing, use of personal
protective equipment, and mandatory closure of certain activities. Center Parcs has implemented these regulations as
well as increased cleaning of communal areas and touch points (door handles, handrails, table tops etc), order and pay
technology to reduce face to face interactions and cashless to remove payment by notes and coins. Center Parcs has
also benefited from UK governmental support initiatives, such as the CJRS, the VAT reduction and business rates’
holiday. See “Risk Factors—The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect
_Center Parcs’ business, financial condition and results of operations” and “Risk Factors—Governmental regulation_
_may adversely affect Center Parcs’ existing and future operations and results” and “Management’s Discussion and_
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results Of Operations—The_
_COVID-19 pandemic.”_

Center Parcs is subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to its relationship with its employees,
including minimum wage requirements, child labour laws, health benefits, and overtime and working condition
requirements. In addition, Center Parcs is subject to the Equality Act 2010.

Center Parcs was the first UK organisation to receive the Wildlife Trust’s “Biodiversity Benchmark” across
all of its sites, with all of the villages retaining their certification as of October 2018.

named above was £2.0 million (including cash compensation for salary, bonuses, pensions and other benefits). The
remaining members of the Board of Directors do not receive any compensation from Center Parcs for their services.

**Pension Schemes**

Center Parcs currently operates two pension arrangements, namely: (a) the Center Parcs Group Pension Plan
(“GPP”), a personal pension plan open to all employees and in which employees are automatically enrolled; and
(b) the Center Parcs Senior Pension Scheme (“FS **Scheme”), an occupational final salary (defined benefit)**
arrangement with seven members, of which one senior employee is an active member. The eight members also include
four pensioners who are in receipt of a pension. As of 31 December 2020, the GPP had approximately 4,400 members
representing approximately 50% of all employees. As at 31 July 2017, the date of the last tri-annual valuation, the FS
Scheme assets amounted to 79% of its liabilities with a deficit of approximately £3.6 million on an on-going basis. As
of 31 July 2017, the cost of buying out the members’ benefits would have been approximately £10.9 million. The next

**Corporate Governance**

Center Parcs manages risks through the Risk Committee, which is made up of the executive management
committee and other selected senior managers and meets quarterly to evaluate risks that have occurred, new and
emerging risks, and the effectiveness of mitigating controls. On a day-to-day basis, Center Parcs’ Fire, Health and
Safety Steering Committee oversees the safety and well-being of the guests and meets every ten weeks, chaired by the
Operations Director. Matters not resolved by the Fire, Health and Safety Steering Committee are escalated to the Risk
Committee. Center Parcs’ Data Protection Governance Committee meets six-monthly to consider and review data
protection risks and issues, including significant new projects or data breaches, and is chaired by the HR and
Commercial Services Director.

Center Parcs has a team of internal auditors based across all five villages that operates independently from
village operations. The audit team looks at trends across the business to ensure that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements. Before the commencement of each financial year, the
directors and senior management are consulted to prepare an audit plan for the year, highlighting areas that raise
concern. Audits are then performed at each village by the team of internal auditors and the resulting report is circulated
to the directors. Recommendations arising from the reports are discussed with the relevant management personnel to
ensure that controls are improved in a manner that results in efficient and secure procedures.

**Management Employment Contracts**

All members of the Operating Board have permanent employment contracts of indefinite terms, terminable
on 12 months’ notice by the employer and 6 months’ notice by the relevant employee. The contracts include a standard
commitment not to compete during their employment as well as a 6-month non-compete post-contractual restrictive

existing villages.

CP Opco also grants CP Ireland a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable and perpetual
licence to use and reproduce any brands or trademarks owned or licensed by CP Opco and used by any of the existing
villages (including the core “Center Parcs” brand and trademarks) for the purposes of running the business of Longford
Forest which is described in further detail below. This IP licence is terminable only in certain limited circumstances
as described below.

The Longford Management Services Agreement, but not the licence of the intellectual property rights, may
be terminated in the following circumstances: (i) if CP Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates, by either CP Opco
or CP Ireland providing two years’ written notice; and (ii) by either CP Opco or CP Ireland for non-payment, subject
to an aggregate grace period for payment of 15 days. If CP Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates, CP Opco may
terminate the Longford Management Services Agreement and the licence of the intellectual property rights by written
notice if CP Ireland does or omits to do anything which causes a material adverse effect to the value of the core “Center
Parcs” brand and trademarks (taken as a whole). In addition, if CP Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates: (i) CP
Ireland may terminate the licence of the intellectual property rights only by six months’ written notice and (ii) CP
Opco may terminate the licence of the intellectual property rights only by three months’ written notice if CP Ireland
ceases to brand Longford Forest as a “Center Parcs” site. The licence of CP Opco’s intellectual property rights
(excluding the marks referred to below) is a royalty free, non-exclusive and non-transferable (subject to the terms of
the Longford

Management Services Agreement) licence whereas the licence of the trademarks (which includes the core
Center Parcs brand and trademarks, and any other brands or trademarks owned or licensed by CP Opco and used by
any of the existing villages) is a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable (subject to the terms of the Longford
Management Services Agreement) and (unless terminated in accordance with the Longford Management Services
Agreement) irrevocable and perpetual licence.

Where a notice of termination has been served by CP Opco due to CP Ireland doing or omitting to do anything
which causes a material adverse effect on the value of the core “Center Parcs” brand and trademarks (taken as a whole)
the licence of the intellectual property rights will terminate on the date on which CP Ireland receives the written notice
of termination whereas, in respect of the other provisions of the Longford Management Services Agreement, CP Opco
shall provide exit services to CP Ireland for a period of 12 months from the date of the written notice of termination.
If CP Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates and either CP Opco or CP Ireland provides two years’ written notice
to the other to terminate, CP Opco shall provide exit services to CP Ireland for six months prior to the end of the two
year notice period. Such exit services include the handover of data (to the extent permitted by law) required to honour
future bookings of Longford Forest and market to past and existing guests of Longford Forest and assistance with the
handover or replacement of third party supplier contracts, shared IT services and equipment, payroll and HR systems,

151

and the phasing out of the use of CP Opco’s intellectual property rights. The exit services will be provided in return
for a service charge of a sum equal to CP Opco’s cost of providing the exit services, such amount being increased by
20% if CP Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates. At any time when exit services are provided, CP Opco and CP
Ireland will not be affiliates and the termination events which lead to CP Opco being required to provide exit services
only apply once CP Opco and CP Ireland cease to be affiliates.

The liability of CP Opco to CP Ireland whether arising from negligence, breach of contract or otherwise shall
not exceed an aggregate cap of £15 million. CP Opco may also be liable to CP Ireland where it causes damage to any
physical property up to an aggregate cap of £10 million provided that CP Ireland must first recover any loss for damage
to physical property from insurance proceeds. Neither CP Opco nor CP Ireland limits its liability for fraud, death or
personal injury arising from its negligence or that of its employees, agents or subcontractors. Neither CP Opco nor CP
Ireland shall be liable to each other for: (i) loss of profits, revenues or contracts, business interruption, or loss or
corruption of data; or (ii) indirect, special or consequential loss or damage, even if such loss was reasonably
foreseeable and whether arising from negligence, breach of contract or otherwise.

**Intercompany Account Agreement**

On 10 July 2020, CP Opco entered into the Intercompany Account Agreement with BSREP II Center Parcs
Jersey Ltd. (the **_Lender) pursuant to which the Lender has made available an intercompany account of up to_**

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following summary of the material terms of the Class A2 Notes, the Class A4 Notes, the Class A5 Notes,_
_the Liquidity Facility Agreement, Topco Payment Undertaking, Topco Share Security Agreement and CP Cayman_
_Security Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the_
_underlying documents._

**Class A Notes**

The Issuer issued the Class A2 Notes on the Closing Date and issued the Initial Class A4 Notes on the Second
Issue Date. On the Fourth Closing Date, the Issuer issued the Further Class A4 Notes, which were consolidated and
form a single series with the Initial Class A4 Notes, following the date on which the Temporary Global Note issued
in respect of the Further Class A4 Notes was exchanged for the Permanent Global Note representing the Class A4
Notes. On the Fifth Closing Date, the Issuer issued the Second Further Class A4 Notes, which were consolidated and
form a single series with the Initial Class A4 Notes and the Further Class A4 Notes, and the Class A5 Notes. The
Second Further Class A4 Notes, together with the Further Class A4 Notes and the Initial Class A4 Notes are referred
to as the “Class A4 Notes”. The Class A2 Notes, the Class A4 Notes and the Class A5 Notes are referred to as the
“Class A Notes”.

On the Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Class A2 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make an
advance to the Original Borrowers pursuant to the terms of the Original Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in
an aggregate principal amount of £440.0 million (the “Class A2 Loan”). On the Second Closing Date, the proceeds
of the issue of the Initial Class A4 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make an advance to the Borrowers pursuant to
the terms of an amended and restated Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (the “First Amended and Restated
**Class A IBLA”) in an aggregate principal amount of £140.0 million (the “Initial Class A4 Loan”). On the Fourth**
Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Further Class A4 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make an advance
to the Borrowers pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (the
“Second Amended and Restated Class A IBLA”) in an aggregate principal amount of £100.0 million (the “Further
**Class A4 Loan”). On the Fifth Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Second Further Class A4 Notes and the**
Class A5 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make two advances to the Borrowers pursuant to the terms of an amended
and restated Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (the “Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement” or the
“Class A IBLA”) in an aggregate principal amount of (x) £100.0 million in respect of the Second Further Class A4
Notes (the “Second Further Class A4 Loan” which was consolidated with the Initial Class A4 Loan and the Further
Class A4 Loan and together designated the “Class A4 Loan”) and (y) £379.5 million in respect of the Class A5 Notes
(the “Class A5 Loan”).

The Original Borrowers used the Class A2 Loan to refinance existing debt facilities (and the payment of
related fees and expenses), and for general corporate purposes. The Borrowers used the Class A3 Loan and the Initial
Class A4 Loan to refinance the loan of £300,000,000 (the “Class A1 Loan”) advanced by the Issuer to the Borrowers
under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Facility and for the purchase of CP Woburn Opco. The Borrowers used the Further
Class A4 Loan, together with the proceeds of the Class B3 Loan and the Class B4 Loan to (i) repay the Class B2 Loan
(including the payment of any prepayment premium and any accrued and unpaid interest); (ii) make a distribution out
of the Restricted Group, the proceeds of which were used to fund the development of Longford Forest, Center Parcs’
sixth village in County Longford, Republic of Ireland; (iii) make a distribution to shareholders; and (iv) pay fees, costs
and expenses related to the transactions. The Borrowers used the Second Further Class A4 Loan and the Class A5
Loan to (i) repay the loan of £350,000,000 (the “Class A3 Loan”) advanced by the Issuer to the Borrowers under the
Class A Issuer/Borrower Facility (including the payment of any prepayment premium and any accrued and unpaid
interest); (ii) to make a distribution to shareholders, (iii) to pay fees, costs and expenses related to those transactions;
and (iv) for general corporate purposes.

The economic terms and conditions of the Class A2 Loan, the Class A4 Loan, and the Class A5 Loan
(together, the “Class A Loans”) (including, among other things, in relation to the payment of interest and the
repayment and prepayment of principal) are broadly similar to the economic terms and conditions of the Class A2
Notes, the Class A4 Notes, and the Class A5 Notes, respectively.

The obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Class A Notes will rank equally in respect of security and as to
payment of interest and repayment and prepayment of principal but in priority to the obligations of the Issuer in respect
of the Class B Notes in point of security and as to payment of interest and repayment and prepayment of principal.

154


-----

The Class A2 Notes bear interest at the rate of 7.239% per annum from (and including) the Closing Date up
to (but excluding) 28 February 2024 and 7.919% from (and including) 28 February 2024 up to (but excluding) 28
February 2042. The Class A4 Notes bear interest at the rate of 3.588% per annum from (and including) their respective
dates of issuance up to (but excluding) 28 August 2025 and 4.244% from (and including) 28 August 2025 up to (but
excluding) 28 February 2042. The Class A5 Notes bear interest at the rate of 3.690% from (and including) the Fifth
Closing Date up to (but excluding) 28 August 2028 and 4.190% from (and including) 28 August 2028 up to (but
excluding) 28 February 2047.

**Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement**

**_Repayments and Prepayments_**

The Class A2 Loan Expected Maturity Date is 23 February 2024 (the “Class A2 Loan Expected Maturity
**Date” or the “Class A2 EMD”), the Class A4 Loan Expected Maturity Date is 22 August 2025 (the “Class A4 Loan**
**Expected Maturity Date” or the “Class A4 EMD”), and the Class A5 Loan Expected Maturity Date is 23 August**
2028 (the “Class A5 Loan Expected Maturity Date” or the “Class A5 EMD”). The Borrower must repay each of
the Class A2 Loan and the Class A4 Loans in full on 25 February 2042 and the Class A5 Loan in full on 25 February
2047, to the extent not repaid, prepaid or otherwise discharged in full prior to that date.

In certain circumstances the Borrowers will be required to prepay the Class A Loans in full, including if it
has become unlawful for the Issuer or the Borrower to perform any of their respective obligations under the relevant
documents or if a Borrower is, or will be, required to pay to the Issuer a tax payment as a result of a change in law or
in any published practice or concession of any relevant tax authority.

In addition, the Borrowers may, by giving the relevant notice to the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee,
voluntarily prepay (or ensure that a Borrower prepays) all or part (if applicable) of any outstanding Class A Loan
provided that certain conditions are satisfied.

**_Representations_**

The Class A IBLA has standard representations and warranties made by each Obligor. These representations
include (subject, in some cases, to agreed exceptions and qualifications as to materiality and reservations of law) the
following representations:

(a) its due incorporation, valid existence, power and authority to own its assets and carry on its business
as it is being conducted;

(b) it has the power to enter into and perform the senior finance documents;

(c) it has not breached any judgment, law, regulation, order or decree applicable to it;

(d) its obligations under the senior finance documents are legal, valid, binding and enforceable;

(e) no default or termination event is outstanding;

(f) no litigation, arbitration or administrative proceedings against any member of the Obligor Group
has been started or, to its knowledge, threatened;

(g) it has a good, valid marketable title to, or valid leases or licences of, and all appropriate authorisation
to use, the assets necessary for it to carry on its business as presently conducted at each of the
properties except for non-material defects;

(h) no insolvency event has occurred and is continuing in relation to it;

(i) there are no agreements, arrangements or resolutions with any of its affiliates which: (i) call for a
further issue or allotment of any share or loan note (or any equivalent by), or for the benefit of, an
Obligor; or (ii) allow any other person to directly participate in the Obligor Group’s profits;

(j) matters relating to insurances;

(k) no contingent liabilities or commitments not disclosed in relevant financial statements;

(l) matters relating to centre of main interest;

(m) matter relating to intellectual property rights; and

155


-----

(n) absence of litigation, arbitration or administrative proceedings.

**_Security_**

The obligations of the Obligors under the Class A IBLA are secured by the Obligors in favour of HSBC
Corporate Trustee Company (UK) Limited (the “Borrower Security Trustee”) for the benefit of the borrower secured
creditors by way of fixed and floating charges created by a borrower deed of charge (the “Borrower Deed of Charge”)
and by a deed of charge entered into by CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited (the “Woburn Deed of Charge”,
and together with the Borrower Deed of Charge, the “Class A Borrower Deed of Charge”). The security from each
of the Obligors include first-ranking mortgages or first fixed charges over their freehold and leasehold interests in the
villages, their bank accounts and the share capital of their subsidiaries.

**_Financial Covenants_**

In addition to the general covenants described below, the Class A IBLA contains a financial covenant that
requires the Borrowers to maintain a ratio (expressed as a percentage) of free cash flow to class A total debt service
charges (the “Class A FCF DSCR”) equal to or greater than 110% on each Financial Covenant Test Date. The
Borrowers will have the benefit of certain cure rights in the event that the Class A FCF DSCR is less than 110%.

A waiver has been granted with respect to the requirement to comply with the Class A FCF DSCR covenant
for the Financial Covenant Test Dates falling in August 2020, February 2021 and August 2021; and, the basis on
which the Class A FCF DSCR covenant is calculated for the purposes of the Financial Covenant Test Date falling in
February 2022 has been amended to ensure that such calculation is not adversely affected by any enforced closure of
or operational restrictions in respect of the holiday villages during the 12-month look-back period in respect of the
Financial Covenant Test Date falling in February 2022.

If on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the Obligors fail to pay the full amount due on such date in respect of
the Class B Loans, the waivers and/or amendments in respect of the Class A FCF DSCR covenant will cease to have
any effect, with effect from the day immediately preceding the Financial Covenant Test Date occurring prior to such
Loan Interest Payment Date.

**_Class A Restricted Payments_**

The Class A IBLA prohibits any Obligor from, at any time, making any payment of dividend, or other
distribution in respect of shares, or any redemption in respect of share capital, or any repayment of principal or
payment of interest in respect of any financial indebtedness owed by an Obligor to an entity that is not an Obligor, or
granting a loan in cash or in kind, or any purchase of any debt owed by an Obligor to an entity which is not an Obligor
(such restricted payment a “Class A Restricted Payment”) to any entity that is an affiliate of the Borrower group but
not an Obligor at any time unless the Class A Restricted Payment Condition (as defined below) was satisfied as at the
most recent date which is seven Business Days before each loan interest payment date (the “Financial Covenant Test
**Date”).**

The Obligors will not make any Class A Restricted Payments with effect from the date on which the waiver
in respect of the Class A FCF DSCR covenant becomes effective up to the earlier of: (i) the date on which a Waiver
End Date Certificate is delivered to the Borrower Security Trustee; and (ii) the Financial Covenant Test Date occurring
in February 2022.

In addition, the Borrowers must not make any payment in respect of the Class B Loans or purchase any Class
B Notes if the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is not then satisfied, unless such payment is made using new
equity funds of any Borrower received for this purpose or, on or prior to the Financial Covenant Test Date occurring
in February 2022, if a Waiver End Date Certificate has not been delivered to the Borrower Security Trustee the
proceeds of a Class B Loan (provided that the aggregate amount of the proceeds of any Class B Loan that is applied
to pay interest in respect of the Class B Loans may not exceed £75 million).

Notwithstanding that the Class A Restricted Payment Condition is not satisfied, on or prior to the Financial
Covenant Test Date occurring in February 2022, and so long as a Waiver End Date Certificate has not been delivered
to the Borrower Security Trustee, the Borrowers may use the proceeds of any Class B Loan to make payments in
respect of the Class B Loans or purchase any Class B Notes (subject to a cap of £75 million for the purposes of
payments of interest in respect of the Class B Loans).

For these purposes:

156


-----

The “Class A Restricted Payment Condition” is the condition which will be satisfied if:

(i) as at the most recent Financial Covenant Test Date, the Class A FCF DSCR calculated as

**_Original Class B Notes_**

The Issuer issued £280,000,000 11.625% Class B Fixed Rate Notes due 2042 (the “Original Class B Notes”)
on the Closing Date. On the Closing Date, the Issuer, the Original Borrowers, the Guarantors and the Borrower
Security Trustee, among others, entered into a junior loan agreement (the “Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
**Agreement”). Pursuant to the Original Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer made available to the**
Original Borrowers a subordinated secured facility in an aggregate principal amount of £280.0 million (the advance
thereunder, the “Original Class B Loan”). The Original Class B Loan and the Original Class B Notes were refinanced
in full (together with accrued interest and any Class B make-whole payment due in respect of the Original Class B
Notes) by using the proceeds from the issuance of the Class B2 Notes (described below).

**_Class B2 Notes_**

The Issuer issued the Class B2 Notes on the Third Closing Date.

On the Third Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Class B2 Notes were applied by the Issuer to
make advances to the Third Initial Borrowers pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of £560.0 million. Pursuant to the Second
Amended and Restated Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer provided to the Third Initial Borrowers
a secured facility (the “Class B2 Loan”) which was contractually subordinated in terms of payments and security to
the Class A Loans (other than the Topco Share Security).

The Center Parcs Group refinanced the Class B2 Loan and the Issuer redeemed the Class B2 Notes on the
Fourth Closing Date using the proceeds from the issuance of the Further Class A4 Notes, the Class B3 Notes and the
Class B4 Notes.

**_Class B3 Notes_**

The Issuer issued the Class B3 Notes on the Fourth Closing Date.

On the Fourth Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Class B3 Notes were applied by the Issuer to
make advances to the Third Initial Borrowers pursuant to a secured facility (the “Class B3 Facility”) under the Third
Amended and Restated Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of £480.0 million
(“the Class B3 Loan”).

The Issuer intends to redeem the Class B3 Notes in full on the Seventh Closing Date using the proceeds from
the issuance of the Class B6 Notes.

**_Class B4 Notes and Class B5 Notes_**

On the Fourth Closing Date the Issuer issued the Class B4 Notes. On the Sixth Closing Date the Issuer issued
the Class B5 Notes.

The proceeds of the issue of the Class B4 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make advances to the Third
Initial Borrowers pursuant to a secured facility (the “Class B4 Facility”) under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of £250.0 million (the “Class B4 Loan”). The proceeds of the issue of
the Class B5 Notes were applied by the Issuer to make advances to the Third Initial Borrowers pursuant to a secured
facility (the “Class B5 Facility”) under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in an aggregate principal amount

160


-----

of £250.0 million (the “Class B5 Loan”). Each of the Class B Loans is contractually subordinated to the Class A
Facilities pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Third Initial Borrowers must repay the Class B4 Loan in full on the Loan Interest Payment Date in
February 2047 (the “Class B4 Loan Final Maturity Date”) to the extent not repaid, prepaid or otherwise discharged
in full prior to that date. The Third Initial Borrowers must repay the Class B5 Loan in full on the Loan Interest Payment
Date in August 2050 (the “Class B5 Loan Final Maturity Date”) to the extent not repaid, prepaid or otherwise
discharged in full prior to that date

The Class B4 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full on 28 August 2025 (the “Class B4 Note Expected
**Maturity Date”). The Class B5 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full on 28 August 2026 (the “Class B5 Note**
**Expected Maturity Date”),**

The Class B4 Notes accrue interest at the rate of 4.875% per annum from (and including) the Fourth Closing
Date up to (but excluding) 28 August 2025 and, thereafter, 4.875% per annum and the Class B5 Notes accrue interest
at the rate of 6.500% per annum from (and including) the Sixth Closing Date up to (but excluding) 28 August 2026
and, thereafter, 6.500% per annum.

The Class B4 Loan is expected to be redeemed in full by 25 August 2025 (the “Class B4 Loan Expected
**Maturity Date”) and the Class B5 Loan is expected to be redeemed in full by 25 August 2026 (the “Class B5 Loan**
**Expected Maturity Date” and together with the Class B4 Loan Expected Maturity Date, each a “Class B Loan**
**Expected Maturity Date”). If, on the relevant Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date, the relevant Class B Loan**
remains outstanding, the relevant Class B Noteholders can enforce their rights under the Topco Share Security
Agreement and the CP Cayman Security Agreement, each as described in more detail below.

In respect of the Class B4 Notes, from (and including) the Class B4 Note Expected Maturity Date, the Issuer
will not make payments of interest in respect of the Class B4 Notes. Instead, interest will accrue on the Class B4 Notes
at the applicable rate (as set out above) but will be deferred and will be payable only on the earlier of (a) the date on
which the Class A Notes are repaid in full and (b) 28 February 2047. Interest will accrue on such deferred interest at
the rate otherwise payable on unpaid principal of the Class B4 Notes at such time.

In respect of the Class B5 Notes, from (and including) the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date, the Issuer
will not make payments of interest in respect of the Class B5 Notes. Instead, interest will accrue on the Class B4 Notes
at the applicable rate (as set out above) but will be deferred and will be payable only on the earlier of (a) the date on
which the Class A Notes are repaid in full and (b) 28 August 2050. Interest will accrue on such deferred interest at the
rate otherwise payable on unpaid principal of the Class B5 Notes at such time.

The economic terms and conditions of the Class B4 Loan and Class B5 Loan (including, among other things,
in relation to the payment of interest and the repayment and prepayment of principal) are broadly similar to the terms
and conditions of the Class B4 Notes and Class B5 Notes.

From 28 August 2020, the Third Initial Borrowers may prepay all or a part of the Class B4 Facility on any
one or more occasions at a specified prepayment price (expressed as a percentages of principal amount depending on
the year in which such prepayment is made), plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, on the
Class B4 Facility prepaid, to the applicable date of prepayment. Upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax law,
the Third Initial Borrowers may prepay all of the Class B4 Facility at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued
and unpaid interest.

At any time prior to 28 August 2021, the Third Initial Borrowers may, at their option, prepay all or part of
the Class B5 Facility on any one or more occasions at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the Class B4 Facility prepaid, plus the applicable premium and accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to the date of prepayment.

On or after 28 August 2022, the Third Initial Borrowers may prepay all or a part of the Class B5 Facility on
any one or more occasions at a specified prepayment price (expressed as a percentages of principal amount depending
on the year in which such prepayment is made), plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, on
the Class B5 Facility prepaid, to the applicable date of prepayment.

The Third Initial Borrowers may prepay all or part of the Class B5 Loan at any time on or after 28 August
2022 at the prepayment prices specified herein. Prior to 28 August 2022, the Borrowers may prepay the Class B5 Loan
in whole or in part at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid

161


-----

interest, and additional amounts, if any, up to the prepayment date plus the applicable “make-whole” premium, as
described herein. Prior to 28 August 2022, the Borrowers may prepay up to 10% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Class B5 Loan in each calendar year at a prepayment price equal to 103% of the principal amount of
the Class B5 Loan prepaid. In addition, prior to 28 August 2022, the Borrowers may use the net proceeds of specified
equity offerings to prepay up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Class B5 Loan at a prepayment price
equal to 106.500% of the principal amount of the Class B5 Loan prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and
additional amounts, if any, up to the prepayment date, provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Class B5 Loan remains outstanding following the prepayment. Additionally, the Borrowers may prepay
all, but not less than all, of the Class B5 Loan at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any,
and additional amounts, if any, up to the prepayment date upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax
law.

Upon certain events constituting a change of control, the Borrowers may be required to make an offer to
repurchase all the Class B5 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, deferred interest amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and additional
amounts, if any, up to the purchase date.

Under the Class B IBLA, the Obligors are required to give certain representations and become subject to
certain covenants in respect of the Class B4 Loan and the Class B5 Loan, which are substantially the same as those in
respect of the Class B6 Loan and described in more detail in the section entitled “Description of the Class B6 Loan”.

**Share Enforcement Event**

No event of default may occur with respect to the Class B Notes or Class B Loans while the Class A Loans
or Class A Notes are still outstanding (until after an acceleration of the Class A Notes or Class A Loans, respectively).
However, upon the occurrence of any event that would otherwise constitute an event of default (each, a “Share
**Enforcement Event”), the Class B Noteholders have the ability to demand repayment by Topco pursuant to the Topco**
Undertaking and direct the security trustee to enforce the security granted pursuant to the Topco Security Documents.
The events that could lead to such a Share Enforcement Event or, in certain cases, an event of default, are customary
for high yield debt instruments and subject to customary grace periods. See “Description of the Class B6 Loan” for a
further description of the Share Enforcement Events.

If at any time no Class A Loans or Additional Class A Loans remain outstanding, or an acceleration of the
Class A Loan has occurred, any such Share Enforcement Event will also constitute a Class B Loan Event of Default.

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Class B Notes and any non-contractual obligations arising
out of or in connection with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Class B Notes are governed by
English law.

**Borrower Security Documents**

The obligations in respect of the Class B4 Loan and the Class B5 Loan benefit from the security described
in the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements – Borrower Security Documents”

**Liquidity Facility Agreement**

On the Second Issue Date, the Issuer entered into the Liquidity Facility Agreement with, among others,
Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, the Liquidity Facility Agent, the Cash Manager and the
Issuer Security Trustee, pursuant to which Barclays Bank PLC and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch agreed to
make a liquidity facility (the “Liquidity Facility”) available to meet certain liquidity shortfalls. On the Fourth Closing
Date, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch transferred its commitment under the Liquidity Facility to NatWest Markets
Plc and the Liquidity Facility Agreement was amended to be on the terms described below, with certain further
amendments, also reflected below, made on the Fifth Closing Date to reflect an increase in the size and extension of
the term of the Liquidity Facility.

In May 2019, NatWest Markets Plc transferred its commitment under the Liquidity Facility to HSBC UK
Bank Plc. Following various transfers between Barclays Bank PLC and HSBC UK Bank Plc, HSBC UK Bank Plc
and Barclays Bank PLC each have 50 per cent. of the commitments under the Liquidity Facility Agreement.
References to “Liquidity Facility Providers” below shall be to Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”) and HSBC UK
Bank Plc (“HSBC”).

162


-----

Under the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Liquidity Facility Providers will provide a 364-day
commitment in an aggregate amount equal to £90 million, with Barclays providing a £45 million commitment and
HSBC providing a £45 million commitment. The Issuer will be permitted to make drawings to service interest due on
the Class A Notes, together with certain senior ranking expenses owed to other transaction parties, in the event of
there being insufficient cash flow received from the Obligors under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

The Liquidity Facility Agreement provides that the amounts drawn by the Issuer (such amounts, a “Liquidity
**Loan Drawing”) and repaid to the Liquidity Facility Providers may be redrawn.**

Each Liquidity Facility Provider must be a bank, the long term unsecured, unsubordinated and unguaranteed
long term obligations of which must be rated, in the case of S&P BBB and, in the case of Fitch, BBB (or, in each case,
such other lower rating which is consistent with the published criteria (relevant for the applicable counterparty) of the
relevant Rating Agency) (the “Requisite Rating”).

The Liquidity Facility Agreement provides that: if (i) at any time the relevant rating of a Liquidity Facility
Provider falls below the Requisite Rating; or (ii) a Liquidity Facility Provider does not agree to renew such Liquidity
Facility prior to the expiry of the 364 day period, the Issuer shall, if it is unable to enter into a substitute liquidity
facility in accordance with the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement, draw the available commitment of such
Liquidity Facility Provider and place the same on deposit (such drawing, a “Standby Drawing” and, together with a
Liquidity Loan Drawing, a “Drawing”) in the relevant Liquidity Standby Account. The Issuer may only withdraw
amounts from such Liquidity Standby Account to enable the Issuer to service interest due on the Class A Notes,
together with certain senior ranking expenses owed to other transaction parties, in the event of there being insufficient
cash flow received from the Obligors under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

In addition, in the event that a Standby Drawing was made following the downgrade of a Liquidity Facility
Provider, the Issuer will use its reasonable endeavours to help such Liquidity Facility Provider to find a suitable
replacement Liquidity Facility Provider or guarantor (as applicable) with the Requisite Rating.

Interest accrues on any Drawing at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin equal to 1.50% per annum (together
with certain mandatory costs). Under the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Issuer is also required to pay
additional amounts if: (i) a withholding or deduction for or on account of tax is imposed on payments required to be
made to any Liquidity Facility Provider; or (ii) any Liquidity Facility Provider suffers an increase in the cost of
providing its Commitment under the Liquidity Facility. From the Year 5 Step-Up Date the rate of interest applicable
to any Drawing made in respect of the Liquidity Facility Agreement will increase, every six months, on a cumulative
basis by the Year 5 Step-Up Margin up to a maximum of 5% per annum for these purposes:

“Year 5 Step-Up Date” means the Note Interest Payment Date next following 1 June 2020.

“Year 5 Step-Up Margin” means 0.50% per annum, increasing by 0.50% on each Note Interest Payment
Date following the Year 5 Step-Up Date up to a maximum of 5.00% per annum.

The Issuer is intending to transition the floating rate provisions in the Liquidity Facility Agreement from
LIBOR to SONIA with such transition to take effect prior to the end of 2021.

Payments due under the Liquidity Facility will rank senior to interest and principal payments on the Class A
Notes and the Class B Notes, and after certain third party costs and expenses other than in relation to Liquidity
Subordinated

Amounts which rank junior to interest and principal payments on the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes.
The Liquidity Facility Providers will not be permitted to enforce the security granted by the Obligors under the
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreements.

For these purposes:

“Liquidity Subordinated Amounts” means all amounts payable under, or in any way in connection with,
the Liquidity Facility Agreement, other than:

(a) principal and interest in respect of any Drawing made under the Liquidity Facility Agreement,
except that:

(i) part of the interest (for the relevant interest period) on such Drawing which represents a
mandatory cost in excess of 0.20% per annum on the maximum amount drawn under the
Liquidity Facility Agreement from time to time; and

163


-----

(ii) in respect of a Drawing made on or after the Year 5 Step-Up Date, the Year 5 Step-Up
Margin;

(b) the commitment fee payable under the Liquidity Facility Agreement;

(c) any costs payable by the Issuer to an LF Finance Party under the Liquidity Facility Agreement as a
result of any increased costs of such LF Finance Party, including those arising from:

(i) the introduction of, or any change in, or any change in the interpretation, administration or
application of, any law or regulation; or

(ii) compliance with any law or regulation made after the date of the Liquidity Facility
Agreement.

In the event that the Issuer is unable to make any payment of amounts due pursuant to the Liquidity Facility
Agreement, such amounts will accrue default interest at a rate of 1% per annum higher than the rate which would have
been otherwise payable, up to but excluding the date of actual payment.

_Governing Law_

The Liquidity Facility Agreement is governed by English law.

**Intercompany Account Agreement**

On 10 July 2020, CP Opco entered into an intercompany account agreement (the Intercompany Account
**_Agreement) with BSREP II Center Parcs Jersey Ltd. pursuant to which CP Opco has made a drawing of £70,000,000._**

obligations and other security granted in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee for itself and each of the
other Borrower Secured Creditors under each Borrower Security Document and all notices of assignment or
charge given pursuant to any of the Borrower Security Documents and all acknowledgements given in respect
of such notices.

10.2 **Notice of assignment and acknowledgement — Borrower level**

deemed to constitute written notice to each Borrower Secured Creditor by each Second Obligor and
the Borrower Security Trustee of the assignment by each Second Obligor to the Borrower Security
Trustee of its right, title, interest and benefit, existing now or in the future, in, to, under or in respect

above for the purposes of Section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925.

The Borrower Security Trustee may from time to time accept as Borrower Security for the Borrower Secured

Security Trustee directed by the relevant Instructing Group.

representation, warranty and approval given by the Issuer Security Trustee, directed by relevant
Instructing Group, in any instruction delivered to it or agreement made with it without further
enquiry. When releasing the benefit of any Security Interests, right, obligation or other security
and/or, as the case may be, reassigning any property, the Borrower Security Trustee is not required
to consider whether any rights of or obligations owed to any Borrower Secured Creditor will be or
are likely to be prejudiced by such release or, as the case may be, reassignment. In any such case,
the Borrower Security Trustee will not incur any liability to any person for so relying or for so not
considering.

10.6 **Reinstatement**

Where any release or discharge (whether in respect of the obligations of any Obligor or any security for those
obligations or otherwise) is made in whole or in part or any arrangement is made on the faith of any payment,
security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored on insolvency, liquidation or otherwise,
the liability of such Obligor under the Borrower Security Documents to discharge the secured obligations (in
the form of a covenant to pay or otherwise) shall continue as if the release or discharge or arrangement had
not occurred and the Issuer Security shall to the greatest extent possible be restored.

10.7 **Discharge of Borrower Secured Liabilities**

Creditor (other than the Borrower Security Trustee) in respect of any Borrower Secured Liabilities, such
Borrower Secured Creditor must give written notice to the Borrower Security Trustee that such Borrower
Secured Liabilities have been discharged in full as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence
of such discharge. Such Borrower Secured Creditor will cease to be a Borrower Secured Creditor under the
ICA in respect of the relevant Borrower Secured Liabilities due to it and will, if no Borrower Secured
Liabilities remain outstanding to it, be deemed to have seceded as a party from the ICA in the relevant
capacity only.

10.8 **Release of Security on discharge of Borrower Secured Liabilities**

Upon all of the Borrower Secured Liabilities being irrevocably and unconditionally discharged in full and
none of the relevant Borrower Secured Creditors being under any further actual or contingent obligation to

(whether out of court or otherwise), the Borrower Security Trustee will upon receipt of such

(i) within four business days of receipt or presentation of the application for the appointment
of an administrator or, if the applicant has abridged the time for making the application,

of the other or others.

(b) If any Obligor becomes aware of any application for the appointment of an administrator of the
Issuer, a notice of intention to appoint an administrator of any Obligor or documents to be, or
actually filed with, a competent court or registrar for the administration of the Issuer, then it will
immediately inform the Issuer Security Trustee in writing of such application, notice or filing, and
if applicable, provide to the Borrower Security Trustee copies of all documentation and/or details
of any information that it has received and/or is aware of in relation to any such application, notice
or filing.

(c) For the purposes of paragraph (a), “business day” will have the meaning given to it in the Insolvency

the Borrower Security Trustee or a person appointed by it will attend the hearing of the application
to oppose the application or make such submissions in respect of the application as the Borrower

_administrator — Obligor level), the Borrower Security Trustee will agree that notwithstanding any_
other term of the ICA or any other Borrower Transaction Document, it is adequately indemnified
and secured to its satisfaction in respect of such appointment by virtue of its rights under the ICA

the circumstances referred to in paragraph 26.5 (Appointment of Receiver to block an administrator

appointment.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt:

(i) nothing in paragraph 26.5 (Appointment of Receiver to block an administrator — Obligor
level) or paragraph 26.6 (Indemnity is adequate — Obligor level) shall be construed so as
to impose on the Borrower Security Trustee any obligation to indemnify any administrative
receiver appointed by it pursuant to paragraph 26.5 (Appointment of Receiver to block an
administrator — Obligor level) except to the extent of (and from) the cash and assets
comprising the Borrower Secured Property held by the Borrower Security Trustee at such

Fitch; will not be monitored by Fitch and therefore will not be updated to reflect changed
circumstances or information that may affect the Ratings Assessment; and does not address other
matters falling outside of the Relevant Disposal (as defined in the Class A IBLA) that may be of

(b) If the Borrower Security Trustee (or its Representative) intends to enter into and/or give its consent
to a Relevant Disposal then the Borrower Security Trustee (or its Representative, as the case may
be) must promptly provide written notice of such intention to the Issuer, the Class A Note Trustee,

from service of a Disposal Intention Notice to the end of the applicable Class B Call Option Period.

(c) Within one Business Day of (i) the receipt of a Disposal Intention Notice and/or (ii) the occurrence
of a Class B Call Option Trigger Event as set out in paragraph (b) of the definition of that term,
above, the Issuer must publish (or cause the Principal Paying Agent in respect of the Class B Notes

242


-----

to publish) a notice (a “Class B Call Option Notice”) to the Class B Noteholders in accordance
with the Class B Conditions and on a Regulatory Information Service (with a copy to the Class A
Note Trustee and the Class B Note Trustee) detailing (I) the occurrence of the relevant Class B Call
Option Trigger Event, (II) the right of the Class B Noteholders to exercise the Class B Call Option
in accordance with the terms of the Class A Conditions, the Class B Conditions and the Intercreditor

(f) Payment must be made to Class A Noteholders in freely transferable funds to their account

of the purchase price by all relevant Class B Noteholders will be a condition precedent to the
obligation of any Class A Noteholders to transfer, or consent to the transfer, of the Class A Notes

**Topco Payment Undertaking**

Pursuant to an amended and restated deed of undertaking entered into on the Fourth Closing Date, Topco has

(a) the then principal balance of the Class B Loans;

(b) any accrued but unpaid interest outstanding in respect of the Class B Loans;

(c) any Additional Amounts; and

arising as a result of any amount (including without limitation, any principal amount or premium of a Class B Loan)
remaining outstanding (whether or not due and payable) under a Class B Loan as at the close of business on the Class
B Loan Expected Maturity Date of such Class B Loan and (ii) the date on which Topco receives a valid notice of
demand from the Borrower Security Trustee following the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event or Class B Loan
Event of Default.

Failure by Topco to pay such amount will give the right to the Borrower Security Trustee (on instruction
from the Class B Note Trustee or, as the case may be, the Class B Noteholders) to enforce the Topco Share Security
granted to the Borrower Security Trustee by Topco over the shares Topco holds in CP Cayman Limited and the share
security granted to the Borrower Security Trustee by CP Cayman Limited over the shares it holds in Center Parcs
(Holdings 1) Limited. The proceeds from the enforcement of this share pledge must be effected in the most tax efficient
manner at the relevant time as a subscription of shares in the Borrowers who then have to use the funds to prepay the
Class B Loans.

The Class B Payment Amount is also due if there is a Class B Loan Event of Default. The Borrowers will
then apply such amounts in payment and/or prepayment of amounts outstanding on the Class B IBLA.

The Issuer will apply all amounts received by it from the Borrowers or, as the case may be, Topco, in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. Topco will agree not to exercise any right of set-off or

interests of the holders of the Class B Notes then outstanding) determine, _inter alia, that any event which would_
otherwise constitute a Class B Note Event of Default, a Class B Loan Event of Default or Class B Loan Potential
Event of Default shall not be treated as such, provided that the Class B Note Trustee shall not exercise such powers in
contravention of any express direction given by a Class B Extraordinary Resolution of the holders of the Class B Notes
then outstanding or in contravention of a request in writing made by holders of not less than 30% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Class B Notes then outstanding.

_Modification_

The Class B Note Trustee may, without the consent or sanction of the Class B Noteholders, at any time and
from time to time, concur with the Issuer or any other person in making any modification (other than in respect of a
Class B Basic Terms Modification) to the Class B Conditions or the Transaction Documents (subject to the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement) provided that the Class B Note Trustee is of the opinion that such modification: (i) will
not be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class B Noteholders then outstanding; (ii) is made to correct a
manifest error; or (iii) is of a formal, minor, administrative or technical nature or to comply with mandatory provisions
of law. Any such modification shall be binding on the Class B Noteholders and shall be notified as soon as is
practicable thereafter by the Issuer to the Class B Noteholders in accordance with the Class B Conditions.

A variation of the Note Trust Deed is valid only if it is in writing, signed by or on behalf of each party thereto
and complies with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Note Trust Deed provides that, in connection with the exercise by it of any of its rights, duties, trusts,
powers, authorities or discretions under the Class B Conditions (including, without limitation, any modification,
waiver, authorisation, determination or substitution) or any other Transaction Document the Class B Note Trustee
shall have regard to the general interests of the Class B Noteholders of each class or sub-class as a class or sub-class,
without having regard to the effect of such action on individual Class B Noteholders.

_Action, proceedings and indemnification_

The Class B Note Trustee shall not be bound to take any actions, proceedings, or steps in relation to the Note
Trust Deed, the Class B Notes or any other Transaction Document unless directed to do so by the relevant Instructing
Group in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, and then only if it shall be indemnified and/or secured to its
satisfaction against any liabilities relating to such actions.

Only the Class B Note Trustee may enforce the provisions of the Class B Notes or the relevant provisions of
the Note Trust Deed and, in all cases, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Voting_

The Note Trust Deed contains provisions regulating the way in which voting in respect of matters to be
approved by Class B Noteholders is to be conducted, and also contains disenfranchisement provisions which result in
the Class B Notes for the time being held by the Issuer, Obligors, affiliates thereof or any other person for the benefit
of the Issuer or an Obligor not being counted in the quorum for a vote or being able to participate in any such vote.

_ICA voting requests_

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, on receipt of a request from the Obligor Group
Agent in respect of an ICA Proposal that gives rise to an Entrenched Right in respect of which the Issuer is an Affected
Secured Creditor, if the Class B Noteholders are affected by such Entrenched Right, the Class B Note Trustee shall
serve notice to pass a resolution to the holders of the Class B Notes then outstanding.

On receipt of a request from the Obligor Group Agent in respect of a General Matter or Discretion Matter or
other ICA Proposal, the Class B Note Trustee shall promptly send a copy of such notice to the Class B Noteholders.

or more global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons attached (the Class B Rule 144A Registered

represented by a global note in fully registered form without interest coupons attached (the Class B Regulation S
**_Registered Global Note and, together with the Class B Rule 144A Registered Global Notes, the Class B Global Notes)._**
The Class B Global Note in respect of the Class B4 Notes has been deposited on behalf of the subscribers of the

of Notes of the relevant class equal to the aggregate principal amount thereof for which it had subscribed and paid.

1.2 For so long as the Class B Notes are represented by a Class B Global Note and the Clearing Systems so
permit, the Class B Notes will be tradeable only in the minimum authorised denomination of £100,000 and higher
integral multiples of £1,000.

1.3 The Class B Registrar shall maintain a register in respect of the Class B Notes (the Class B Register) outside
the United Kingdom which shall be the sole register in respect of the Class B Notes in accordance with the provisions
of the Agency Agreement and shall record in the Class B Register the names and addresses of the Holders of the Class
B Notes, particulars of the Class B Notes and all transfers and redemptions thereof.

1.4 Title to the Class B Notes will pass by and upon registration in the Class B Register. The Holder of each
Class B Note shall (except as otherwise required by a court of competent jurisdiction or applicable law) be treated as

that Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg have been closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days
(other than by reason of holiday, whether statutory or otherwise) or have announced an intention permanently to cease
business or have in fact done so and, in any such case, no successor clearing system satisfactory to the Class B Note
Trustee is available or (b) by reason of a change in Tax law (or the application or official interpretation thereof), which
change becomes effective on or after the Fourth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B4 Notes), the Sixth Closing
Date (in respect of the Class B5 Notes) or the Seventh Closing Date (in respect of the Class B6 Notes), the Issuer has
or will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would not be suffered were the Class B Notes in definitive
form and a certificate to such effect signed by two directors of the Issuer has been given to the Class B Note Trustee,
then the Issuer will issue Class B Notes of the relevant class in definitive form (Class B Definitive Notes) in exchange
for such Class B Global Note (free of charge to the persons entitled to them) within 30 days of the occurrence of the
relevant event. These Class B Conditions and the Transaction Documents will be amended in such manner as the Class
B Note Trustee and the Issuer Security Trustee may require to take account of the issue of Class B Definitive Notes.

1.7 Class B Definitive Notes, if issued, will only be printed and issued in denominations of £100,000 and integral

any sub-class thereof in all respects (or in all respects except for the first payment of interest). Such Class B Further

relevant sub-class of Class B Notes. In addition, the Issuer may, from time to time, create and issue Class B New
Notes (in accordance with Condition 19.1 (Class B Further Notes and Class B New Notes)) having terms that differ
from the Class B4 Notes, the Class B5 Notes and the Class B6 Notes and do not form a single series with any of them.

initial issue of such Class B Notes.

Confirmation with respect thereto.

(f) The Class B Notes are solely the obligation of the Issuer and are not the obligation of, nor guaranteed by, any
of the Class B Note Trustee, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Issuer Account Bank, the Cash Manager, the

###### 4. CLASS B INTEREST

**Period of accrual**

4.1 Each Class B Note (or, in the case of the redemption of only part of a Class B Note, that part only of such
Class B Note) will cease to bear interest from (and including) the due date for redemption unless, upon due presentation
in accordance with Condition 6 (Payments), payment of the principal in respect of the Class B Note is improperly
withheld or refused or default is otherwise made in respect of the payment, in which event interest shall continue to
accrue as provided in the Note Trust Deed.

**Class B Interest Rate and Note Interest Payment Dates**

4.2 (a) The Class B4 Notes bear interest on their respective Principal Amount Outstanding (i) from (and including)

the Fourth Closing Date until (but excluding) the Class B4 Note Step-Down Date at 4.875% per annum and
(ii) from (and including) the Class B4 Note Step-Down Date to (and including) the Class B4 Note Final
Maturity Date, at 4.875% per annum (in each case, the applicable Class B4 Interest Rate). The Class B5
Notes bear interest on their respective Principal Amount Outstanding (i) from (and including) the Sixth
Closing Date until (but excluding) the Class B5 Note Step-Down Date at 6.500% per annum and (ii) from
(and including) the Class B5 Note Step-Down Date to (and including) the Class B5 Note Final Maturity Date,

on their respective Principal Amount Outstanding (i) from (and including) the Seventh Closing Date until
(but excluding) the Class B6 Note Step-Down Date at   % per annum and (ii) from (and including) the Class
B6 Note Step-Down Date to (and including) the Class B6 Note Final Maturity Date, at   % per annum (in
each case, the applicable Class B6 Interest Rate) and together with the Class B4 Interest Rate and the Class
B5 Interest Rate, the Class B Interest Rate.

(b) With respect to Class B4 Notes, the period from and including the Fourth Closing Date to (but excluding)
the Note Interest Payment Date occurring on 28 August 2017, with respect to the Class B5 Notes, the period
from and including the Sixth Closing Date to but excluding the Note Interest Payment Date occurring on 28
February 2021, and with respect to the Class B6 Notes, the period from and including the Seventh Closing
Date to but excluding the Note Interest Payment Date occurring on 28 August 2021, and each period from
(and including) a Note Interest Payment Date to (but excluding) the next succeeding Note Interest Payment
Date is called a Note Interest Period. For the purposes of the foregoing, the Note Interest Payment Dates will
be 28 February and 28 August of each year (each a Note Interest Payment Date), commencing on 28 August
2017 (in respect of the Class B4 Notes), 28 February 2021 (in respect of the Class B5 Notes) and 28 August
2021 (in respect of the Class B6 Notes). If, however, any such day is not a Business Day, the Note Interest
Payment Date will instead be the next Business Day in that calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding
Business Day (if there is not).

(c) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the Issuer receives a payment of interest (whether in whole or in part)
on the Class B4 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,
then the Issuer will be obliged to make a corresponding payment of interest (in whole or in part, as the case
may be) on the Class B4 Notes on the corresponding Note Interest Payment Date. If on any Note Interest
Payment Date, the amount received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B4 Loan is
not sufficient to pay the interest accrued on the Class B4 Notes during the immediately preceding Note
Interest Period in full, the amount of interest accrued up to any such Note Interest Payment Date that is not
paid by the Issuer on such Note Interest Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest
being a Class B4 **_Deferred Interest Amount) and such Class B4 Deferred Interest Amount shall continue to_**
accrue interest at the then applicable Class B4 Interest Rate until it is paid by the Issuer in full.

266


-----

(d) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date:

(i) the Issuer receives a payment of interest on the Class B4 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance
with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in excess of the amount of interest accrued on
the Class B4 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period; and

(ii) on such Note Interest Payment Date, a Class B4 Deferred Interest Amount in respect of any prior
Note Interest Period remains outstanding,

then the Issuer shall apply such excess to reduce the then outstanding Class B4 Deferred Interest Amount.
Any accrued but unpaid interest and the aggregate amount of all Class B4 Deferred Interest Amounts then
unpaid on the Class B4 Notes and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts (if
any) shall be due and payable by the Issuer in pounds sterling on the Class B4 Note Final Maturity Date.

(e) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the Issuer receives a payment of interest (whether in whole or in part)
on the Class B5 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,
then the Issuer will be obliged to make a corresponding payment of interest (in whole or in part, as the case
may be) on the Class B5 Notes on the corresponding Note Interest Payment Date. If on any Note Interest
Payment Date, the amount received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B5 Loan is
not sufficient to pay the interest accrued on the Class B5 Notes during the immediately preceding Note
Interest Period in full, the amount of interest accrued up to any such Note Interest Payment Date that is not
paid by the Issuer on such Note Interest Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest
being a Class B5 **_Deferred Interest Amount) and such Class B5 Deferred Interest Amount shall continue to_**
accrue interest at the then applicable Class B5 Note Interest Rate until it is paid by the Issuer in full.

(f) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date:

(i) the Issuer receives a payment of interest on the Class B5 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance
with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in excess of the amount of interest accrued on
the Class B5 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period; and

(ii) on such Note Interest Payment Date, a Class B5 Deferred Interest Amount in respect of any prior
Note Interest Period remains outstanding,

then the Issuer shall apply such excess to reduce the then outstanding Class B5 Deferred Interest Amount.
Any accrued but unpaid interest and the aggregate amount of all Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts then
unpaid on the Class B5 Notes and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts (if
any) shall be due and payable by the Issuer in pounds sterling on the Class B5 Note Final Maturity Date.

(g) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date, the Issuer receives a payment of interest (whether in whole or in part)
on the Class B6 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,
then the Issuer will be obliged to make a corresponding payment of interest (in whole or in part, as the case
may be) on the Class B6 Notes on the corresponding Note Interest Payment Date. If on any Note Interest
Payment Date, the amount received by the Issuer in respect of a payment of interest on the Class B6 Loan is
not sufficient to pay the interest accrued on the Class B6 Notes during the immediately preceding Note
Interest Period in full, the amount of interest accrued up to any such Note Interest Payment Date that is not
paid by the Issuer on such Note Interest Payment Date will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest
being a Class B6 **_Deferred Interest Amount) and such Class B6 Deferred Interest Amount shall continue to_**
accrue interest at the then applicable Class B6 Note Interest Rate until it is paid by the Issuer in full.

(h) If on any Loan Interest Payment Date:

(i) the Issuer receives a payment of interest on the Class B6 Loan from the Borrowers in accordance
with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in excess of the amount of interest accrued on
the Class B6 Notes during the immediately preceding Note Interest Period; and

267


-----

(ii) on such Note Interest Payment Date, a Class B6 Deferred Interest Amount in respect of any prior
Note Interest Period remains outstanding,

then the Issuer shall apply such excess to reduce the then outstanding Class B6 Deferred Interest Amount.
Any accrued but unpaid interest and the aggregate amount of all Class B6 Deferred Interest Amounts then
unpaid on the Class B6 Notes and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts (if
any) shall be due and payable by the Issuer in pounds sterling on the Class B6 Note Final Maturity Date.

**Calculation of Class B Interest**

###### 4.3 Interest in respect of the Class B Notes and interest payable in respect of any overdue amount of principal or
Class B4 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B6 Deferred Interest
Amounts (as applicable) shall be calculated by applying the applicable Class B Interest Rate to the aggregate Principal
Amount Outstanding of each sub-class of the Class B Notes or the aggregate amount of any overdue amount of
principal or Class B4 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B6 Deferred
Interest Amounts (as applicable) in respect of the Class B4 Notes, the Class B5 Notes and the Class B6 Notes, as the
case may be, and on the basis of (a) the actual number of days in the period from (and including) the date from which
interest begins to accrue (being the Fourth Closing Date (in respect of the first such period for the Class B4 Notes),
the Sixth Closing Date (in respect of the first such period for the Class B5 Notes), the Seventh Closing Date (in respect
of the first such period for the Class B6 Notes) or a Note Interest Payment Date (in respect of subsequent such period))
(the Class B Accrual Date) to (but excluding) the date on which it falls due divided by (b) the actual number of days
from (and including) the Class B Accrual Date to (but excluding) the next following Note Interest Payment Date
multiplied by two; provided that in respect of accrued interest to the first Note Interest Payment Date, interest shall be
calculated on the basis of (a) in respect of the Class B4 Notes: (x) the actual number of days from (and including) the
Fourth Closing Date to (but excluding) 28 August 2017 divided by (y) the actual number of days from (and including)
28 February 2017 to (but excluding) 28 August 2017 multiplied by two; (b) in respect of the Class B5 Notes: (x) the
actual number of days from (and including) the Sixth Closing Date to (but excluding) 28 February 2021 divided by
(y) the actual number of days from (and including) 28 February 2020 to (but excluding) 28 February 2021 multiplied
by two; and (c) in respect of the Class B6 Notes: (x) the actual number of days from (and including) the Seventh
Closing Date to (but excluding) 28 August 2021 divided by (y) the actual number of days from (and including) 28
February 2021 to (but excluding) 28 August 2021 multiplied by two. The resulting figure shall be rounded down to
the nearest penny.

###### 5. REDEMPTION, PURCHASE AND CANCELLATION

**Final Redemption**

5.1 (a) Unless previously redeemed in full as provided in this Condition 5 (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation),

the Issuer shall redeem:

(i) the Class B4 Notes at their aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding together with any accrued but
unpaid interest, any Class B4 Deferred Interest Amounts in respect of the Class B4 Notes and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B4 Note Final
Maturity Date;

(ii) the Class B5 Notes at their aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding together with any accrued but
unpaid interest, any Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts in respect of the Class B5 Notes and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B5 Note Final
Maturity Date; and

(iii) the Class B6 Notes at their aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding together with any accrued but
unpaid interest, any Class B6 Deferred Interest Amounts in respect of the Class B6 Notes and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B6 Note Final
Maturity Date

268


-----

(b) The Issuer may not redeem the Class B Notes in whole or in part prior to the Class B Note Final Maturity
Date except as provided below in Condition 5.2 (Redemption), Condition 5.3 (Optional Redemption for
_taxation or other reasons) or Condition 5.4 (Early redemption following a Class B Loan Enforcement Event)_
but without prejudice to Condition 9 (Class B Note Events of Default).

**Redemption**

5.2 (a) (i) The aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B4 Notes shall be repaid by the Issuer, if the

Issuer has sufficient funds to enable it to do so, on the Class B4 Note Expected Maturity Date, (ii) the
aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B5 Notes shall be repaid by the Issuer, if the Issuer has
sufficient funds to enable it to do so, on the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date, and (iii) the aggregate
Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B6 Notes shall be repaid by the Issuer, if the Issuer has sufficient
funds to enable it to do so, on the Class B6 Note Expected Maturity Date, subject to Condition 5.3 (Optional
_Redemption for taxation or other reasons), Condition 5.4 (Early redemption following a Class B Loan_
_Enforcement Event) and Condition 5.5 (Principal Amount Outstanding), as applicable._

(b) A failure of the Issuer to redeem in full the Class B4 Notes on the Class B4 Note Expected Maturity Date,
the Class B5 Notes on the Class B5 Note Expected Maturity Date or the Class B6 Notes on the Class B6
Note Expected Maturity Date, in each case, in accordance with these Class B Conditions and/or the
occurrence of a Class B Note Event of Default (or any event which would constitute a Class B Note Event
of Default but for Condition 9.2) will result in the Class B Note Trustee having the right (subject to the Note
Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement) at its discretion to, or shall, upon the instruction of holders of
at least 30% of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B Notes, direct the Borrower
Security Trustee to exercise its rights under the Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco Security
Documents (a Class B Trigger Event). The non-payment on any Class B Note Expected Maturity Date of
any principal amount which would otherwise be payable on such date under this Condition 5.2 (Redemption)
shall not constitute a Class B Note Event of Default pursuant to Condition 9 (Class B Note Events of Default)
including, for the avoidance of doubt, where such non-payment occurs as a result of the Issuer not receiving
any payment due under a Class B Loan on the relevant Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date. If the Issuer
receives (or is to receive) any monies from the Borrowers under the Topco Payment Undertaking or the
proceeds realised from any enforcement of the Topco Security Documents, the Issuer shall upon giving not
more than 10 nor less than 5 Business Days’ notice (which notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject
to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent) to the Class B Noteholders in accordance with
Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders), apply such monies to redeem on a pro rata basis the Class B
Notes at their respective Principal Amount Outstanding together with accrued but unpaid interest, Class B4
Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B6 Deferred Interest
Amounts (as applicable) and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any. In the
event that there are insufficient amounts to redeem all of the Class B Notes then outstanding, the Class B
Notes shall be redeemed on a pro rata basis in part in the proportion with which the repayment amount bears
to the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all the Class B Notes then outstanding.

(c) If the proceeds realised following a Class B Trigger Event are insufficient to satisfy all amounts scheduled
to be paid under paragraph (a) above, the Issuer will be obliged to apply any further amounts, if any, it
receives as a result of and pursuant to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement to repay any outstanding
amounts on the Class B Notes on a pro rata basis.

(d) In addition, promptly upon receipt by the Issuer of a notice of prepayment from a Borrower under the Class
B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement of its intention to make prepayment in whole or in part of any Class B
Loan in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer shall give not more than
60 nor less than 10 days’ notice to the relevant Class B Noteholders, the Class B Note Trustee and the
Principal Paying Agent that it will apply the principal funds received from the prepayment of the Class B
Loan to redeem a corresponding Principal Amount Outstanding of the relevant Class B Notes together with
accrued but unpaid interest, Class B4 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts
and/or Class B6 Deferred Interest Amounts (as applicable) in respect of the relevant sub-classes of Class B
Notes and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, on the aggregate Principal
Amount Outstanding of such Class B Notes at the applicable redemption prices set out in the Class B

**Optional Redemption for taxation or other reasons**

5.3 (a) If the Issuer at any time certifies to the Class B Note Trustee immediately prior to endeavouring to take the

reasonable measures available to it referred to below that:

(i) by reason of a change in tax laws or regulations (or the application or official interpretation thereof),
which change becomes effective on or after the Fourth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B4
Notes), the Sixth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B5 Notes) or the Seventh Closing Date (in
respect of the Class B6 Notes), on the next Note Interest Payment Date, the Issuer would be required
to deduct or withhold from any payment of principal, interest or other amounts due and payable
under the relevant Class B Notes, any amount for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or
assessed by the United Kingdom or Jersey or any political sub-division thereof or any authority
thereof or therein; or

(ii) by reason of a change in tax laws or regulations (or the application or official interpretation thereof),
which change becomes effective on or after the Fourth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B4
Notes), the Sixth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B5 Notes) or the Seventh Closing Date (in
respect of the Class B6 Notes), on the next Note Interest Payment Date, the Borrowers under the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement would be required to deduct or withhold from any
payment of principal, interest or other sum due and payable thereunder any amount for or on account
of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature
imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the United Kingdom or any political sub-division
thereof or any authority of either thereof or therein; or

(iii) by reason of a change in tax laws or regulations, which change becomes effective on or after the
Fourth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B4 Notes), the Sixth Closing Date (in respect of the
Class B5 Notes) or the Seventh Closing Date (in respect of the Class B6 Notes), it ceases to be a
“securitisation company” (as defined in the Taxation of Securitisation Companies Regulations

governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the
United Kingdom or any political sub-division thereof or any authority thereof or therein for any
amount that it is obliged to pay and satisfies the Class B Note Trustee that such change will result
in a material rise in the tax liabilities of the Issuer; or

(iv) on or after the Fourth Closing Date (in respect of the Class B4 Notes), the Sixth Closing Date (in
respect of the Class B5 Notes) or the Seventh Closing Date (in respect of the Class B6 Notes), it has
become or will become unlawful for the Issuer to make, fund or allow to remain outstanding all or
any advances made or to be made by it under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,

then the Issuer shall, in consultation with the Borrowers and the Class B Note Trustee, take reasonable
measures to avoid the effect of the relevant event described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, (including, without
limitation, appointing a Paying Agent in another jurisdiction and/or using its reasonable endeavours to
arrange the substitution of a company incorporated and/or tax resident in another jurisdiction (approved in
writing by the Class B Note Trustee) as principal debtor under the relevant Class B Notes and as lender under
the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement; provided that the Class B Note Trustee is satisfied that taking
such measures will not be materially prejudicial to the interests of the relevant Class B Noteholders.

(b) If the Issuer satisfies the Class B Note Trustee immediately before giving the notice referred to below, that
one or more of the events described in (a) above is continuing and that the effect of the relevant event cannot
be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it, then the Issuer may, on any Note Interest
Payment Date and having given not more than 60 nor less than 10 days’ notice (or, in the case of an event

271


-----

described in (a) above, such shorter period expiring on or before the latest date permitted by relevant law) to
the Class B Note Trustee and the Class B Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B
_Noteholders) (notice being irrevocable), redeem all, but not some, of the affected Class B Notes at their_
respective Principal Amount Outstanding together with accrued but unpaid interest, Class B4 Deferred
Interest Amounts and/or Class B5 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B6 Deferred Interest Amounts (as
applicable) and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, up to but
excluding the date of redemption. Prior to giving any notice of redemption pursuant to this Condition 5.3
(Optional Redemption for taxation or other reasons), the Issuer shall deliver to the Class B Note Trustee (A)
a certificate signed by two directors of the Issuer stating that (x) one or more of the events described in Clause
(a) above is continuing and that the effect of the relevant event cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking
reasonable measures available to it, and (y) the Issuer will have the necessary funds to pay all principal and
interest due, if any, in respect of the relevant Class B Notes on the relevant Note Interest Payment Date and
to discharge all other amounts required to be paid by it on the relevant Note Interest Payment Date in priority
to, or pari passu with, the Class B Notes under the Issuer Priorities of Payments; and (B) if required by the
Class B Note Trustee, an opinion (in form and substance satisfactory to the Class B Note Trustee) of
independent legal advisors of recognised standing opining on the relevant event described in (a)(i), (a)(ii),
(a)(iii), and/or (a)(iv). The Class B Note Trustee shall be entitled to accept such certificate (without enquiry
or liability) and (if applicable) such opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set out in (x) and (y) above, and it shall be conclusive and binding on the Class B Noteholders.

**Early redemption following a Class B Loan Enforcement Event**

5.4 If the Issuer receives (or is to receive) any monies from any Obligor following the service of a Class B Loan
Enforcement Notice in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement in repayment of all or any part of the Class B
Loans, the Issuer shall, upon giving not more than 10 nor less than 5 Business Days’ notice to the Class B Note
Trustee, the Issuer Secured Creditors and the Class B Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class
_B Noteholders), apply such monies in accordance with the Issuer Pre-Acceleration Priority of Payments or the Issuer_
Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable, and redeem (to the extent of such monies as are available in
accordance with the relevant Issuer Priorities of Payments) each relevant Class B Note then outstanding at its aggregate
Principal Amount Outstanding plus accrued but unpaid interest, Class B4 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B5
Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B6 Deferred Interest Amounts (as applicable) in respect of such Class B Note
and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, on the relevant date for payment. In the
event there are insufficient monies to redeem all the Class B Notes of a particular sub-class, each relevant sub-class
of the Class B Notes shall be redeemed in part in the proportion with which the repayment amount bears to the
aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of such sub-class of the Class B Notes then outstanding.

**Principal Amount Outstanding**

5.5 (a) The Principal Amount Outstanding of a Class B Note on any date shall be its original principal amount less

the amount of all principal payments (excluding premium payable in accordance with Condition 5.2
(Redemption)), in respect of such Class B Note which have been paid since the Fourth Closing Date (in the
case of the Class B4 Notes), the Sixth Closing Date (in the case of the Class B5 Notes) or the Seventh Closing
Date (in the case of the Class B6 Notes), except if and to the extent that any such payment has been improperly
withheld or refused.

(b) Each determination by or on behalf of the Issuer of the amount of any Class B Note principal payment and
the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of a Class B Note shall in each case (in the absence of wilful
default, bad faith or demonstrable or manifest error) be final and binding on all persons. As soon as
practicable following a determination of a Class B Note principal payment and/or the aggregate Principal
Amount Outstanding of a Class B Note, the Issuer will cause such determination of a Class B Note principal
payment and/or the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class B Note to be notified to the Class
B Note Trustee, the Class B Registrar and the Principal Paying Agent and will cause notice of each such
determination to be given to Class B Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B
_Noteholders)._

Participating FFI or otherwise exempt from withholding or deduction of any Taxes (as that term is defined in Condition
7 (Taxation) below) in respect of FATCA at a time when the Issuer would be required to withhold or deduct any

pursuant to FATCA) provided that:

(a) there will at all times be a person appointed to perform the obligations of the Principal Paying Agent and the

###### 7. TAXATION

All payments in respect of the Class B Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer shall be made without withholding
or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of
whatever nature (Taxes), unless the withholding or deduction of the Taxes is required by applicable law. In such event,
the Issuer shall account to the relevant authorities for the amount required to be withheld or deducted. In such event,
the Issuer will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the Class
B Noteholders after the withholding or deduction shall equal the respective amounts which would have been receivable
in respect of the Class B Notes in the absence of the withholding or deduction; provided that no such additional
amounts will be paid on account of:

(a) any Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any actual or deemed (pursuant to
applicable Tax law of the relevant Tax jurisdiction) present or former connection between the Class B
Noteholder (including, if applicable, a connection between partners (in the case of a partnership) or
shareholders (in the case of a corporation)) and the relevant Tax jurisdiction (including being a resident of
such jurisdiction for Tax purposes), other than holding of such Class B Note, the enforcement of rights under
such Class B Note or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Class B Note;

(b) any Taxes imposed as a result of the presentation of a Class B Note for payment more than 30 days after the
relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Class B Noteholder (except to the extent that the
holder would have been entitled to additional amounts had the Class B Note been presented on the last day
of such 30 day period);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, personal property, transfer or similar Taxes;

(d) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to, the Class
B Notes;

(e) any Taxes imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Class B Noteholder, to comply with any
reasonable written request of the Issuer or the Class B Paying Agent addressed to the Class B Noteholders
and made at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable to satisfy any
certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty,
regulation or administrative practice of a relevant Tax jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or
reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the relevant Tax jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, a certification that the Class B Noteholder is not resident in the relevant Tax
jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the Class B Noteholder or beneficial owner is legally entitled
to provide such certification or documentation;

(f) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment to the Class B Noteholder if such Class B Noteholder
is a fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that
Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had such Class B Noteholder been the sole beneficial
owner of such Class B Notes;

(g) any Taxes payable under FATCA; or

(h) any combination of items (a) through (g) above.

###### 9. CLASS B NOTE EVENTS OF DEFAULT

9.1 Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Class B Note Trustee at its absolute discretion may, and if so
directed in writing by the holders of at least 30% of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class B Notes

each case, to being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction in accordance with the Note Trust Deed) give a notice
(a Class B Note Acceleration Notice) to the Issuer declaring all of the Class B Notes immediately due and payable at
any time after the occurrence of any of the following events or circumstances specified below (each such event or

case of the Issuer Deed of Charge, the Issuer Security Trustee), capable of remedy, but which remains
unremedied for a period of 21 days following the giving of notice by the Class B Note Trustee (or the Issuer
Security Trustee, as applicable) to the Issuer requiring the same to be remedied and, in either case; provided
that the Class B Note Trustee shall have determined that such event is, in its opinion, materially prejudicial

9.2 Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, until the earlier of (i) the date on which all Class A Notes are
redeemed in full and (ii) the date on which the Class A Notes are accelerated, the occurrence of any of the events or
circumstances described in Condition 9.1 above, which otherwise give rise to a Class B Note Event of Default, will
not constitute a Class B Note Event of Default, but will constitute a Class B Trigger Event under Condition 5.2(b).

###### 10. ACCELERATION

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, upon delivery of a Class B Note Acceleration Notice, the Class B
Notes shall become immediately due and payable at their Principal Amount Outstanding together with accrued

Deferred Interest Amounts (as applicable) and any accrued interest thereon, Additional Amounts, if any, and any other

required to give a notice (the Class B Note Enforcement Notice) to the Issuer declaring the whole of the
Issuer Security to be enforceable.

**No Class B Note Events of Default**

11.2 The Issuer, pursuant to the terms of the Note Trust Deed, shall provide on a semi-annual basis written
confirmation to the Class B Note Trustee that no Class B Note Event of Default has occurred.

###### 12. LIMITED RECOURSE

12.1 Notwithstanding any other Condition or any provision of any Transaction Document, all obligations of the
Issuer to the Class B Noteholders are limited in recourse to the property, assets and undertakings of the Issuer that are
the subject of any security created by the Issuer Deed of Charge (the Issuer Secured Property). If:

(a) there is no Issuer Secured Property remaining which is capable of being realised or otherwise converted into
cash;

(b) all amounts available from the Issuer Secured Property have been applied to meet or provide for the relevant
obligations specified in, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Issuer Deed of Charge; and

(c) there are insufficient amounts available from the Issuer Secured Property to pay in full, in accordance with
the provisions of the Issuer Deed of Charge, amounts outstanding under the Class B Notes (including
payments of principal and interest),

which remain unpaid (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payments of principal and/or interest in respect of the
Class B Notes) and such unpaid amounts shall be discharged in full and any relevant payment rights shall be deemed
to cease.

amount owed to it by the Issuer in the insolvency of the Issuer.

13.2 No Class B Noteholder, nor any person acting on behalf of a Class B Noteholder (other than the Issuer
Security Trustee or any Receiver appointed by the Issuer Security Trustee), shall initiate or join any person in initiating
howsoever an Issuer Insolvency Event and it shall not be entitled to take any steps or proceedings which would result
in any of the provisions described in the Intercreditor Agreement or this Condition not being observed.

(g) impair the rights of any of the Class B Noteholders to institute a suit for the enforcement of any payment on
or with respect to any of the Class B Notes or the Topco Security;

(h) release Topco from its obligations under the Topco Payment Undertaking, except as provided in the Note

14.5 Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Class B Note Trustee may agree, or may direct the
Issuer Security Trustee to agree, without the consent of the Class B Noteholders, to any modification which, in the
opinion of the Class B Note Trustee is:

(a) to correct a manifest error or to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency of a formal, minor or technical
nature;

(b) to make any change that would provide the Class B Noteholders with any additional benefits or rights, or that
does not adversely affect the legal rights of any such holder in any material respect;

(c) to allow any member of the Group established or incorporated after the Closing Date to become an Obligor;

(d) to provide the issuance of Class B Additional Notes in accordance with Condition 19 (Further Notes and

of the Class B Noteholders, determine that a Class B Note Event of Default or a Share Enforcement Event shall not,
or shall not subject to specified conditions, be treated as such.

14.7 Any such modification, waiver, authorisation or determination shall be binding on the Class B Noteholders
and, unless the Class B Note Trustee agrees otherwise, any such modification shall be notified to the Class B
Noteholders as soon as practicable thereafter in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders).

14.8 The Class B Note Trustee shall be entitled to take into account, for the purpose of exercising or performing
any right, power, trust, authority, duty or discretion under or in relation to these Class B Conditions or any of the
Transaction Documents, among other things, to the extent that it considers, in its sole and absolute discretion, it is
necessary and/or appropriate, and/or relevant, any Rating Agency Confirmation (whether or not such confirmation is
addressed to, or provides that it may be relied upon by, the Class B Note Trustee and irrespective of the method by
which such confirmation is conveyed).

14.9 Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement in connection with any such substitution of principal
debtor as is referred to in Condition 5.3 (Optional Redemption for taxation or other reasons), the Class B Note Trustee
and the Issuer Security Trustee may also agree, without the consent of the Class B Noteholders, to a change in the
laws governing the Class B Notes, these Class B Conditions and/or the Transaction Documents, provided that such
change would not, in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Class B
Noteholders.

14.10 Where the Class B Note Trustee is required to have regard to the interests of the Class B Noteholders, it shall
have regard to the interests of such Class B Noteholders as a class and, in particular but without prejudice to the
generality of the foregoing, shall not have regard to, or be in any way liable for, the consequences of such exercise for
individual Class B Noteholders resulting from their being for any purpose domiciled or resident in, or otherwise
connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any particular territory, and the Class B Note Trustee shall not be
entitled to require, nor shall any Class B Noteholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer to any other person, any
indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Class B
Noteholders.

14.11 If and wherever the Issuer shall have issued and have outstanding more than one sub-class of Class B Notes,
the provisions of this Condition 14 shall have effect subject to the following modifications:

(a) a resolution which, in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee, affects only one sub-class of Class B Notes
shall be deemed to be duly approved if approved through a single vote of the holders of that sub-class of
Class B Notes;

279


-----

(b) a resolution which, in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee, affects the holders of more than one sub-class
of Class B Notes but does not give rise to a conflict of interest between the holders of any sub-class of Class
B Notes so affected shall be deemed to have been duly approved if approved through (as a single Class) a
vote of the holders of all the sub-classes of Class B Notes so affected;

(c) a resolution which, in the opinion of the Class B Note Trustee, affects the holders of more than one sub-class
of Class B Notes and gives or may give rise to a conflict of interest between the holders of one sub-class of
Class B Notes so affected and the holders of another sub-class of Class B Notes shall be deemed to have been
duly approved only if approved through a separate vote of the holders of each of the sub-classes of Class B
Notes;

(d) in respect of all approvals all the preceding provisions of this Condition shall apply _mutatis mutandis as_
though references to Class B Notes and Class B Noteholders were references to the sub-class of Class B
Notes in question or to the holders of such sub-class of Class B Notes, as the case may be; and

(e) no Class B Extraordinary Resolution involving a Class B Basic Terms Modification (other than where such
Class B Basic Terms Modification affects only one sub-class of Class B Notes) that is approved by the holders
of one sub-class of Class B Notes shall be effective unless it is approved by a Class B Extraordinary
Resolution of the holders of each other sub-class of Class B Notes (to the extent there are Class B Notes
outstanding in each such other sub-class).

###### 15. INDEMNIFICATION AND EXONERATION OF THE CLASS B NOTE TRUSTEE AND THE ISSUER SECURITY TRUSTEE

15.1 The Note Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement contain provisions governing the responsibility (and
relief from responsibility) of the Class B Note Trustee and the Issuer Security Trustee, respectively, and providing for
their indemnification in certain circumstances, including provisions relieving them from taking enforcement
proceedings or, in the case of the Issuer Security Trustee, enforcing the Issuer Security unless indemnified and/or
secured to their satisfaction.

15.2 The Note Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement also contain provisions pursuant to which the Class B
Note Trustee and the Issuer Security Trustee and their related companies are entitled, amongst other things, to (a)
enter into business transactions with the Issuer and/or any other party to any of the Transaction Documents and to act
as trustees for the holders of any other securities issued or guaranteed by, or relating to, the Issuer and/or any other
party to any of the Transaction Documents, (b) exercise and enforce its rights, comply with its obligations and perform
its duties under or in relation to any such transactions or, as the case may be, any such trusteeship without regard to
the interests of, or consequences for, the Class B Noteholders, and (c) retain and not be liable to account for any profit
made or any other amount or benefit received thereby or in connection therewith.

###### 16. REPLACEMENT OF CLASS B NOTES

If any Class B Note is mutilated, defaced, lost, stolen or destroyed, it may be replaced at the specified office
of the Paying Agent. Replacement of any mutilated, defaced, lost, stolen or destroyed Class B Note will only be made
on payment of such costs, by the respective Class B Noteholder, as may be incurred in connection therewith and on
such terms as to evidence and indemnity as the Issuer may reasonably require. Mutilated or defaced Class B Notes
must be surrendered before new ones will be issued.

###### 17. NOTICE TO CLASS B NOTEHOLDERS

17.1 Any notice shall be deemed to have been duly given to the Class B Noteholders if sent to the Clearing Systems
for communication by them to the holders of the Class B Notes and shall be deemed to be given on the date on which
it was so sent and shall also be published in the following manner. In respect of Class B Definitive Notes, any notice
to the Class B Noteholders shall be validly given if published in a leading daily newspaper printed in the English
language and with general circulation in London and Ireland (which is expected to be the Financial Times and in the
Irish Times, respectively) and (so long as the relevant Class B Notes are admitted to trading on and listed on an

280


-----

exchange), any notice shall also be published in accordance with the relevant listing rules and regulations of such
exchange.

17.2 Class B Noteholders will be deemed for all purposes to have notice of the contents of any notice given to the
holders of Class B Notes in accordance with this Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders).

17.3 A copy of each notice given in accordance with this Condition 17 (Notice to Class B Noteholders) shall be
provided to the Rating Agencies, and to the Irish Stock Exchange, for so long as the Class B4 Notes are listed on the
Irish Stock Exchange (to the extent required by the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange) and to The
International Stock Exchange for so long as the Class B5 Notes and the Class B6 Notes are listed on The International
Stock Exchange to the extent required by the listing rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited.

17.4 The Class B Note Trustee shall be at liberty to sanction some other method of giving notice to the Class B
Noteholders if, in its opinion, such other method is reasonable having regard to market practice then prevailing and to
the requirements of the stock exchange on which the relevant Class B Notes are then admitted to trading and listed
and provided that notice of such other method is given to the Class B Noteholders in such manner as the Class B Note
Trustee shall require.

###### 18. NOTIFICATION

As soon as practicable after becoming aware that any part of a payment of interest or principal on the Class
B Notes will be deferred or that a payment previously deferred will be made in accordance with these Class B
Conditions, the Issuer will give notice thereof to the Class B Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notice to
_Class B Noteholders), and to the Irish Stock Exchange, for so long as the Class B4 Notes are listed on the Irish Stock_
Exchange (to the extent required by the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange).

###### 19. FURTHER NOTES AND NEW NOTES

**Class B Further Notes and Class B New Notes**

19.1 (a) The Issuer may, without the consent of the Class B Noteholders, but subject always to the provisions of these

Class B Conditions and the Note Trust Deed, at its option, raise further funds, from time to time, on any date
by the creation and issue of:

(i) further Class B Notes carrying the same terms and conditions in all respects (or in all respects except
in relation to the first Note Interest Period and first Note Interest Payment Date, the issue date, first
coupon and initial Principal Amount Outstanding) as, and so that the same shall be consolidated and
form a single series and rank _pari passu with, any sub-class of the Class B Notes (the_ **_Class B_**
**_Further Notes); and/or_**

(ii) new Class B Notes which may equally have terms and conditions that differ from the Class B4
Notes, the Class B5 Notes and the Class B6 Notes and which do not form a single series with the
Class B4 Notes, the Class B5 Notes or the Class B6 Notes (the Class B New Notes).

(b) It shall be a condition precedent to issue any Class B Further Notes and/or Class B New Notes (together, the
**_Class B Additional Notes) that:_**

(i) the aggregate principal amount of all such Class B Additional Notes to be issued on such date is not
less than £5.0 million;

(ii) in respect of any Class B Further Notes, the Rating Agencies have confirmed that such Class B
Further Notes are assigned the same ratings (or better) as are then applicable to the Class B Notes
with which they are to be consolidated and form a single series;

281


-----

(iii) the Rating Agencies have provided a Rating Agency Confirmation in respect of the Class B Notes
in relation to the issue of Class B Further Notes or, as the case may be, Class B New Notes (provided
that no such Rating Agency Confirmation is required on the then existing Class B Notes where the
purpose of the Class B New Notes and the related loan to the Borrowers under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement is to refinance a Class B Loan and a sub-class of Class B Notes
in full);

(iv) an amount equal to the gross proceeds of such Class B Further Notes or, as the case may be, the
Class B New Notes (with an amount in respect of any issue expenses or commissions agreed to be
paid by way of fee by the Borrowers pursuant to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) is
applied by the Issuer to make a loan to the Borrowers pursuant to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement and the conditions precedent therein for an advance under any Additional Class B
Facilities are satisfied;

(v) the Class B Note Trustee has received a legal opinion satisfactory to it in relation to, inter alia, the
issue of the Class B Further Notes, or as the case may be, the Class B New Notes from a reputable
international law firm; and

(vi) no Class B Note Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (which has not been waived) or
would occur as a result of such issue.

###### (c) Nothing in this Condition 19 (Class B Further Notes and Class B New Notes) prohibits the Issuer from issuing
Class A Further Notes and/or Class A New Notes in accordance with the Class A Conditions.

**Deeds and Security**

19.2 Any such Class B Additional Notes will be constituted by a further deed or deeds supplemental to the Note
Trust Deed and have the benefit of the security constituted by the Issuer Deed of Charge. Any of the Transaction
Documents may be amended as provided in Condition 2.1(c) (Status and relationship between the Class B Notes) or
otherwise, and further Transaction Documents may be entered into, in connection with the issue of such Class B
Additional Notes and the claims of any of the parties to any amended Transaction Document or any further Transaction
Document may rank pari passu with or behind, the Class B Notes, provided, in each case, that the conditions set out
in Condition 19.1(a) have been satisfied, mutatis mutandis.

###### 20. CLASS B CALL OPTION

20.1 The Class B Notes are issued with the benefit of the Class B Call Option (as defined in and set out in the
Intercreditor Agreement).

20.2 If a Class B Call Option Trigger Event occurs, then subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Class
B Call Option and the other terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Class B Noteholder will be entitled (but not
obliged) to purchase all (but not some only) of the then outstanding Class A Notes at a price equal to the then aggregate
Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class A Notes together with accrued but unpaid interest.

20.3 Following notification of the occurrence of any Class B Call Option Trigger Event by or on behalf of the
Issuer to the Class B Noteholders (such notification, the Class B Call Option Notice), any Class B Noteholders who
wish to exercise the Class B Call Option must comply with the terms (as to procedures and timing for payment and
settlement) set out in the Class B Call Option Notice in order to purchase the Class A Notes in such proportions as the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement may specify.

###### 21. SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE

21.1 The Class B Notes of a sub-class, and the rights of the Class B Note Trustee and the Class B Noteholders
under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Issuer Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect as to all outstanding Class B Notes of such sub-class when (1) (i) all the Class B Notes of such sub-class have

282


-----

become due and payable or (ii) are scheduled to be redeemed at the relevant Class B Note Expected Maturity Date in
accordance with Condition 5.2(a) (Redemption) within one year, or (iii) will become due and payable at the relevant
Class B Note Final Maturity Date within one year or (iv) are to be called for redemption or prepayment within one
year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Class B Note Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by
the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Issuer Security Trustee (or another entity
designated or appointed as agent by the Issuer Security Trustee for this purpose), an amount in Sterling sufficient to
pay and discharge the entire outstanding principal amount on the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes, together with
any redemption premium, if any, accrued and unpaid interest, Class B4 Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B5
Deferred Interest Amounts and/or Class B6 Deferred Interest Amounts (as applicable) in respect of such sub-class of
Class B Notes, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, to the date of deposit (in the case of Class B Notes
that have become due and payable), or to the relevant Class B Note Expected Maturity Date, the relevant Class B Note
Final Maturity Date or prepayment date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under the Class B Conditions with respect to the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes; (4) the Issuer has
delivered an irrevocable notice of redemption to the relevant Class B Noteholders and has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Issuer Security Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Issuer Security
Trustee for this purpose) to apply the funds deposited towards the payment of the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes,
at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Issuer Security
Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate (which the Issuer Security Trustee may rely on without further inquiry and without
liability) to the effect that all conditions precedent under these Class B Conditions relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes have been complied with.

###### 22. NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of Topco or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Topco, Issuer or any Guarantor under
the Class B Finance Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
creation. Each Class B Noteholder by accepting a Class B Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Class B Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public
policy.

###### 23. RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES

No rights are conferred on any person under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any
term of the Class B Notes or these Class B Conditions, but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party
which exists or is available apart from the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

###### 24. GOVERNING LAW

Each of the Transaction Documents, the Class B Global Notes and these Class B Conditions (and, in each
case, any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the relevant document) are governed by, and
shall be construed in accordance with, English law (other than the Issuer Jersey Corporate Services Agreement, the
Issuer Deed of Charge (to the extent governed by Jersey law), the Security Interest Agreement and the Topco Share
Security Agreement, which will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, Jersey law and Cayman Islands
law, respectively).

###### 25. JURISDICTION

The courts of England are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute including any dispute as to
any non-contractual obligations that may arise out of or in connection with the Class B Notes and the Transaction
Documents (save to the extent governed by Jersey law) to which the Issuer is party and, accordingly, any legal
action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Class B Notes and/or the Issuer Transaction
Documents may be brought in such courts. The Issuer has in each of the Issuer Transaction Documents to which it is
a party irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE CLASS B6 LOAN**

_Under the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer agreed to make available to the_
_Borrowers on the Seventh Closing Date the facilities as described below. The following is a summary of certain_
_provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. It is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed_
_provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. Capitalised terms used, but not defined in this_
_“Description of the Class B6 Loan” shall have the meaning given to them in the section “Description of Certain_
_Financing Arrangements” or “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes” set out in this Offering Memorandum, as_
_applicable._

On the Seventh Closing Date, the proceeds of the issue of the Class B6 Notes will be applied by the Issuer to
make advances to the Borrowers in an aggregate principal amount of £255,000,000, pursuant to the terms of the Class
B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the Issuer will provide to the Borrowers secured
facilities in an aggregate principal amount of £255,000,000 with the proceeds of the issue of the Class B6 Notes (the
“Class B6 Facility” and the advance thereunder, the “Class B6 Loan”), which will be contractually subordinated to
the Class A Facilities pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The economic terms and conditions of the Class B6 Facility (including, among other things, in relation to the
payment of interest and the repayment and prepayment of principal) will be broadly similar to the terms and conditions
of the Class B6 Notes.

On the Fourth Closing Date, the Issuer issued the Class B3 Notes and the Class B4 Notes. The Class B3
Notes are expected to be redeemed in full with the proceeds of the issue of the Class B6 Notes. On the Sixth Closing
Date, the Issuer issued the Class B5 Notes. Pursuant to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Issuer
provided to the Borrowers secured facilities in an aggregate principal amount of £480,000,000 with the proceeds of
the issue of the Class B3 Notes (the “Class B3 Facility” and the advance thereunder the “Class B3 Loan”), in an
aggregate principal amount of £250,000,000 with the proceeds of the issue of the Class B4 Notes (the “Class B4
**Facility” and the advance thereunder, the “Class B4 Loan”) and in an aggregate principal amount of £250,000,000**
with the proceeds of issue of the Class B5 Notes (the “Class B5 Facility” and the advance thereunder, the “Class B5
**Loan”), which are each contractually subordinated to the Class A Facilities pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor**
Agreement.

The Class B4 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full by 28 August 2025 (the “Class B4 Note Expected
**Maturity Date”). The Class B5 Notes are expected to be redeemed in full by 28 August 2026 (the “Class B5 Note**
**Expected Maturity Date”). The Class B4 Loan is expected to be redeemed in full by 25 August 2025 (the “Class B4**
**Loan Expected Maturity Date”) and the Class B5 Loan is expected to be redeemed in full by 25 August 2026 (the**
“Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date” and together with the Class B4 Loan Expected Maturity Date and the
Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date (as defined below), each a “Class B Loan Expected Maturity Date”).

**REPAYMENT**

The Borrowers must repay the Class B6 Loan in full on the Class B6 Loan Final Maturity Date to the extent
not repaid, prepaid or otherwise discharged in full prior to that date.

The occurrence of the Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date does not in and of itself result in any
outstanding principal amounts under the Class B6 Loan becoming due. However, if, on the Class B6 Loan Expected
Maturity Date the Class B6 Loan remains outstanding, Topco will be required, under the terms of the Topco Payment
Undertaking, to procure the payment of an amount equal to the aggregate of:

(a) the then outstanding aggregate principal balance on the Class B Loans;

(b) accrued but unpaid interest then outstanding in respect of the Class B Loans;

(c) any Additional Amounts; and

(d) all other amounts due and payable (including, without limitation, premium and interest on overdue
amounts) by the Obligors to the Issuer under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

Failure by Topco to pay such amount will give the right to the Borrower Security Trustee (on instruction
from the Class B Note Trustee as directed by the Class B Noteholders) to enforce the Topco Security granted to it (on
trust for the Issuer) by Topco over the shares Topco holds in Holdco and the shares Holdco holds in Intermediate
Holdco, in each case in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

284


-----

**PREPAYMENT**

**Optional prepayment**

At any time prior to 28 August 2023, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions prepay up to 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Class B6 Loan at a prepayment price equal to    % of the principal amount of
the Class B6 Loan prepaid upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of prepayment (subject to the rights of the Issuer to receive interest on the
relevant Loan Interest Payment Date), with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the initial Class B6 Loan remains outstanding
immediately after the occurrence of such prepayment; and

(2) the prepayment occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

Prior to 28 August 2023, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions prepay during each calendar year
up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Class B6 Loan (including the original principal amount
of any Additional Class B6 Loan), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price of
103.000% of the principal amount of the Class B6 Loan so prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable prepayment date (subject to the right of the Issuer to receive
interest due on the relevant Loan Interest Payment Date).

In addition, at any time prior to 28 August 2023, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions, at their
option, prepay all or a part of the Class B6 Loan upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a
prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Class B6 Loan prepaid, plus the Applicable Premium
and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of prepayment (subject to the rights of
the Issuer to receive interest due on the relevant Loan Interest Payment Date).

Except as described in the first, second and third paragraphs above and set out under “— Taxes — Repayment
_for taxation reasons”, the Class B6 Loan will not be pre-payable at the Borrowers’ option prior to 28 August 2023._

On or after 28 August 2023, the Borrowers may on any one or more occasions prepay all or a part of the
Class B6 Loan upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at the prepayment prices (expressed as
percentages of principal amount) set out below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest
Amount, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B6 Loan
prepaid, to (but excluding) the applicable date of prepayment, if prepaid during the 12-month period beginning on 28
August of the years indicated below, subject to the rights of the Issuer to receive interest on the relevant Loan Interest
Payment Date:

**Year** **Redemption Price**
2023.................................................................................................. %
2024.................................................................................................. %
2025 and thereafter ........................................................................... 100.000%

Unless the Borrowers default on the payment of the prepayment price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Class B6 Loan or portions thereof called for prepayment on the applicable prepayment date.

Any prepayment or notice may, at the Borrowers’ discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent.

Upon any prepayment of the Class B6 Loan pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer will redeem a pro rata
portion of the Class B6 Notes in accordance with the Class B Conditions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale
Offer for the Class B6 Notes, if not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B6
Notes are validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and purchased pursuant to such tender offer, Change of Control
Offer or Asset Sale Offer (as applicable) by a Borrower, the Borrowers may prepay the remaining principal amount
of the Class B6 Loan, in whole, but not in part, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (and provided
that such notice is delivered no later than 60 days following the purchase date in respect of such tender offer, Change
of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer (as applicable)), at a price equal to the purchase price offered to holders of the
Class B6 Notes pursuant to the tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer (as applicable) (which may

285


-----

be less than par) plus accrued and unpaid interest, Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amount, if any, and any accrued
but unpaid interest thereon, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B6 Loan prepaid to (but excluding) the
applicable date of prepayment. In accordance with the Class B Conditions, in determining whether at least 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Class B6 Notes have been validly tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) pursuant to any tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable, Notes owned by
an Affiliate of a Borrower or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of a Borrower, or any successor thereof,
shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer,
as applicable.

**Mandatory Prepayment**

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Borrowers shall, within one Business Day of receipt of any
monies received by the Borrowers under the Topco Payment Undertaking, apply such monies to prepay the maximum
amount of the Class B Loans (together with all accrued and unpaid interest, Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amounts,
if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, and Additional Amounts, if any) that may be prepaid with such
monies.

**INTEREST**

**Calculation of interest**

The rate of interest on the Class B6 Loan for each Loan Interest Period (as defined below) is the percentage
per annum as follows:

(1) in respect of any Loan Interest Period falling in the period starting on (and including) the Seventh
Closing Date and terminating on (and excluding) the Class B6 Loan Step-Down Date,   % per annum; and

(2) in respect of any Loan Interest Period falling after (and including) the Class B6 Loan Step-Down
Date up to (but excluding) the Class B6 Loan Final Maturity Date,   % per annum,

(each, the applicable “Class B6 Interest Rate”).

The period from (and including) the Seventh Closing Date to (but excluding) the first Loan Interest Payment
Date and each successive period from (and including) a Loan Interest Payment Date to (but excluding) the next
succeeding Loan Interest Payment Date, is called a “Loan Interest Period”.

**Payment of interest**

Subject to the following three paragraphs, the Borrowers must pay accrued interest on the Class B Loans on
each Loan Interest Payment Date.

From (and including) the Seventh Closing Date to (but excluding) the Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date
(as defined below), interest will accrue on any overdue amount of principal or interest (including Additional Amounts,
if any) in respect of the Class B6 Loan at the applicable Class B6 Interest Rate. For the avoidance of doubt, any failure
to pay interest on a Loan Interest Payment Date will not constitute a Class B Loan Event of Default for as long as any
Class A Notes remain outstanding but will constitute a Share Enforcement Event. The “Class B6 Loan Expected
**Maturity Date” will be the date falling three Business Days prior to the Class B6 Note Expected Maturity Date. The**
“Class B6 Note Final Maturity Date” will be the Note Interest Payment Date falling on 28 August 2051.

From (and including) the Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date, interest will accrue on the principal amount
of the Class B6 Loan at the applicable Class B6 Interest Rate until (but excluding) the Class B6 Loan Final Maturity
Date but such accruing interest will be deferred (any such accrued but deferred interest being a “Class B6 Loan
**Deferred Interest Amount”) and such Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amount shall accrue interest at the then**
applicable Class B6 Interest Rate until it is paid by the Borrowers in full. On each Loan Interest Payment Date, interest
accrued on the Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amount during the immediately preceding Loan Interest Period shall
be added to the then outstanding Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and thereafter paid at the times and in the
same manner as the Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amount. The Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon will be payable by the Borrowers only on the earlier of (x) the date on which the
Class A Loans are repaid in full (the “Initial Payment Date”) and (y) the Class B6 Note Final Maturity Date (as
defined above); provided that if on the Initial Payment Date, the Borrowers do not have sufficient cash to pay the
Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon in full on such date in accordance
with the Borrower Priorities of Payments, any unpaid Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but

286


-----

unpaid interest thereon will not fall due then but will continue to be deferred and will only fall due for payment on
any subsequent Loan Interest Payment Date to the extent of the cash available to the Borrowers for such purpose
determined in accordance with the Borrower Priorities of Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Class B6
Loan, any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, any Class B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amount and any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon may be repaid prior to the Class B6 Note Final Maturity Date using (A) New Equity Funds
received by the Borrowers, (B) funds available following the enforcement of the Topco Security, and/or (C) following
the enforcement of the Borrower Security Documents to the extent funds are available for this purpose pursuant to the
applicable Priorities of Payments (as described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —
_Intercreditor Agreement”)._

**PAYMENTS**

Unless a Class B Finance Document specifies that payments under it are to be made in another manner
(including any payments in specie pursuant to ConditionError! Reference source not found. 5.7 of the Class B
Conditions), all payments by any Obligor to the Issuer under the Class B Finance Documents must be made to the
Issuer Transaction Account (or such other account as the Issuer or, following a Class B Loan Event of Default, the
Borrower Security Trustee may specify to the Borrowers by not less than ten Business Days’ prior written notice).

**TAXES**

**Additional Amounts**

In the event that (i) any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes is required to be made
from payments made by the Issuer under or with respect to the Class B6 Notes and (ii) the Issuer is required under the
Class B Conditions to pay additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) on the Class B6 Notes such that the net
amounts received by each holder of Class B6 Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any such
withholding or deduction in respect of such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have
been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction, the Issuer shall promptly
give written notice of such requirement to the Borrowers and each Borrower will pay such Additional Amounts as
specified in such notice as may be necessary for the Issuer to comply with its obligations under the Class B Conditions.

Each Obligor must make all payments to be made by it under the Class B Finance Documents without any
Tax Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by law.

If an Obligor or the Issuer (or any permitted assignee) is aware that an Obligor must make a Tax Deduction
(or that there is a change in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction), it must promptly notify the other Parties.

If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by an Obligor, the amount of the payment due from the
Obligor will be increased by an amount (also an Additional Amount) that (after making the Tax Deduction) leaves an
amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.

If an Obligor is required to make a Tax Deduction, that Obligor must make the minimum Tax Deduction
allowed by law and must make any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction within the time allowed
by law.

Within 30 days of making either a Tax Deduction or a payment required in connection with a Tax Deduction,
the Obligor making that Tax Deduction or payment must deliver to the Issuer evidence satisfactory to the Issuer that
the Tax Deduction has been made or (as applicable) the appropriate payment has been paid to the relevant taxing
authority.

**Repayment for taxation reasons**

The Borrowers may repay the Class B6 Loan in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee (which notice will be irrevocable)
at a repayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, Class
B6 Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date fixed for
repayment (a “Tax Repayment Date”) (subject to the right of the Issuer to receive interest due on the relevant Loan
Interest Payment Date) and all Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Repayment
Date as a result of the repayment or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer, Borrowers or Guarantors determine in good faith
that the Issuer has the right to redeem the Class B6 Notes upon the occurrence of any of the events listed in Condition
5.3 of the Class B Conditions as set out in the Note Trust Deed. The Borrowers will promptly notify the Issuer and
the Borrower Security Trustee if they elect to repay the Class B6 Loan pursuant to this covenant. If the Borrowers so

287


-----

elect to repay the Class B6 Loan, the Borrowers will deliver to the Borrower Security Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
stating that it is entitled to effect such repayment and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right so to repay have been satisfied. The Borrower Security Trustee will accept such Officer’s
Certificate as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further
inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers and thereafter the Borrowers must repay
or prepay the Class B6 Loan in full on the date specified in the next paragraph below and the Issuer will redeem all of
the Class B6 Notes in accordance with the Class B Conditions.

The date for repayment or prepayment of the Class B6 Loan will be the earlier of:

(a) the relevant Loan Interest Payment Date in respect of the then current Loan Interest Period; or

(b) the date specified by the respective Borrowers in their notification.

**CLASS B CHANGE OF CONTROL**

If a Class B Change of Control occurs with respect to any sub-class of Class B Notes, the Borrowers will
make an offer to the holders of such sub-class of Class B Notes (a “Class B Change of Control Offer”) to repurchase
all or any part (equal to £100,000 or an integral multiple of £1,000 in excess thereof) of the Class B Notes held by
such holders. In the Class B Change of Control Offer, the Borrowers will offer a payment equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, the applicable Class B
Note Deferred Interest Amount, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, and Additional Amounts, if any,
on the Class B Notes of such sub-class repurchased to the date of purchase (the “Class B Change of Control
**Payment”), subject to the rights of holders of the Class B Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on**
the relevant interest payment date; provided, however, that the Borrowers will not be obliged to repurchase the Class
B Notes as described under this “— Class B Change of Control” covenant in the event and to the extent that any
Borrower has unconditionally exercised its right to prepay all of the Class B Loans as described under “— Prepayment
— Optional prepayment” or all conditions to such repurchase have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Borrowers have unconditionally exercised their right to repay the Class B Loans in full as set out
in “— _Prepayment_ — _Optional prepayment” (and all of the relevant Class B Notes have been correspondingly_
redeemed by the Issuer) or all conditions to such repayment have been satisfied or waived, within 30 days following
any Class B Change of Control, the Borrowers will be obliged to deliver a notice to the Issuer, the Class B Note
Trustee and each holder of the Class B Notes to which such Class B Change of Control applies in accordance with the
Class B Conditions, stating:

(1) that a Class B Change of Control Offer is being made and that all Class B Notes tendered will be
accepted for payment;

(2) the purchase price and the prepayment date, which shall be no earlier than 10 days and no later than
60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the “Class B Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) that any Class B Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) that, unless the Borrowers default in the payment of the Class B Change of Control Payment, all
Class B Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Class B Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest
after the Class B Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that holders of Class B Notes electing to have any Class B Notes purchased pursuant to a Class B
Change of Control Offer will be required to transfer the Class B Notes to the nominated account as specified in the
notice of the Class B Change of Control Offer;

(6) that holders of Class B Notes will be entitled to withdraw their election if they deliver notice to the
Borrower (at such facsimile number or address as specified in the notice of the Class B Change of Control Offer), not
later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Class B Change of Control Payment Date,
a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of Class B Notes, the principal amount of Class
B Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing its election to have the Class B Notes
purchased; and

(7) that holders of Class B Notes whose Class B Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued
new Class B Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Class B Notes surrendered, which
unpurchased portion must be equal to £100,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of £1,000 in excess thereof.

288


-----

The Borrowers will be required to comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent
those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the purchase of the Class B Notes as a result of a Class
B Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions
described in this section, the Borrowers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not
be deemed to have breached their obligations under the provisions described in this section by virtue of such
compliance.

On the Class B Change of Control Payment Date, to the extent lawful:

(1) the Borrowers will accept for purchase all or portions of Class B Notes properly tendered pursuant
to the Class B Change of Control Offer;

(2) the Borrowers will deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Class B Change
of Control Payment in respect of all or portions of the Class B Notes properly tendered by such holder for payment
into the account of each tendering holder of Class B Notes (as specified in such holder’s acceptance of the Class B
Change of Control Offer) no later than five days after the Class B Change of Control Payment Date and no later than
60 days from the date the notice set forth in the second paragraph of this covenant has been mailed to holders of Class
B Notes to which such Class B Change of Control applies; and

(3) the Borrowers will deliver or cause to be delivered to the Issuer (in satisfaction, prepayment and
discharge of a pro rata portion of each Borrowers’ liability under the Class B Loans) the Class B Notes properly
accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes being
purchased by the Borrowers and the Issuer shall then deliver such Class B Notes to the Principal Paying Agent and
shall take all other actions and deliver all documents and certificates as are required under the Note Trust Deed or
requested by the Principal Paying Agent to effect a cancellation of such Class B Notes.

The Borrowers will not be required to make a Class B Change of Control Offer with respect to any sub-class
of Class B Notes upon a Class B Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Class B Change of Control Offer for
such sub-class of Class B Notes in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set out
in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement applicable to a Class B Change of Control Offer made by the
Borrowers and purchases all Class B Notes of such sub-class properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Class B
Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of redemption with respect to such sub-class has been given pursuant to “—
_Prepayment — Optional prepayment”, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption_
price by the Borrowers in connection with the repayment of the relevant Class B Loans, or by the Issuer in connection
with the redemption of a pro rata portion of the relevant Class B Notes.

The Issuer will be required to cooperate with the Borrowers in connection with any Class B Change of Control
Offer (including, without limitation, by delivering such notices to the Class B Note Trustee and the holders of Class
B Notes to which such Class B Change of Control applies as the Borrowers may require in order to enable the
Borrowers to comply with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph), and the Borrowers will bear the cost of any
such Class B Change of Control Offer.

**CERTAIN COVENANTS**

**Class B Financial Covenant**

_Required Class B FCF DSCR_

Prior to the occurrence of the Existing Class B Loans Discharge Date, subject to “— Cure right” as set out
below, the Borrowers must ensure that, on each Financial Covenant Test Date (other than, so long as the Class B
Waiver End Date has not occurred, the Financial Covenant Test Dates occurring in August 2020, February 2021 and
August 2021), the ratio of Class B FCF to the Class B Total Debt Service Charges (such ratio, expressed as a
percentage, the “Class B FCF DSCR”) for the applicable FCF DSCR Period is equal to or greater than 100%.

In respect of the calculation of the Class B FCF DSCR on the first and second Financial Covenant Test Date
after the Fourth Closing Date, the Class B Total Debt Service Charges will be deemed to be equal to the actual
annualised Consolidated Interest Expense payable by Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries with effect from the Fourth
Closing Date.

For these purposes each of Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall set their relevant Accounting Periods
such that the end date of the Accounting Period immediately preceding each Financial Covenant Test Date shall be a
date which is not more than 12 weeks prior to such Financial Covenant Test Date.

289


-----

_Cure right_

If:

(1) as at a Financial Covenant Test Date (as described in this paragraph, the “Relevant Financial
**Covenant Test Date”), the Class B FCF DSCR is less than 100%;**

(2) within the period of 30 days thereafter, the Borrowers procure that either:

(A) the Class A Loans and/or the Class B Loans are prepaid in part; and/or

(B) funds are deposited into (or remain in) the Defeasance Account,

using or having been funded by New Equity Funds (the amount so prepaid or deposited, the “Class
**B Specified Amount”); and**

(3) the Recalculated Class B FCF DSCR is not less than 100%,

then for all purposes thereafter (including, without limitation, as to any determination of the occurrence of a Share
Enforcement Event or a Class B Loan Event of Default) the Class B FCF DSCR as at the Relevant Financial Covenant
Test Date shall be deemed to have been the same as the Recalculated Class B FCF DSCR.

The Borrower Security Trustee must, as soon as is reasonably practicable after being so requested, but in any
event not earlier than the Business Day immediately following the Relevant Financial Covenant Test Date, consent to
the release of funds from the Defeasance Account (deposited in the Defeasance Account pursuant to the preceding
paragraph) if and to the extent that, following such release, the Recalculated Class B FCF DSCR (disregarding the
Class B Specified Amount (if any) requested to be so released) remains at or greater than 100% (as certified by CP
Opco in the Class B Compliance Certificate to be provided in connection with such Relevant Financial Covenant Test
Date).

**Limitation on Financial Indebtedness**

Topco will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Financial
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), provided, however, that Topco and any Obligor may Incur Financial
Indebtedness if the Issuer obtains a Rating Agency Confirmation in respect of the Class B Notes.

The provisions described in the preceding paragraph will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following
Financial Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Financial Indebtedness”):

(i) Financial Indebtedness Incurred by any Obligor pursuant to any Credit Facility (including
letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created under any Credit Facility), and
any Refinancing Financial Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of
such Financial Indebtedness, in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding not exceeding (1) prior to the Existing Class B Loans Discharge Date, the
greater of £50.0 million and 25.0% of EBITDA or (2) on and after the Existing Class B
Loans Discharge Date, the greater of £60.0 million and 25.0% of EBITDA plus in the case
of any refinancing of any Financial Indebtedness permitted under this clause (i) or any
portion thereof, fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses
Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(ii) (A) Guarantees by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Financial
Indebtedness of Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in each case so long
as the Incurrence of such Financial Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of
the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement; or

(B) without limiting the provisions described in “— Limitations on Liens”, Financial
Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person
securing Financial Indebtedness of Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries so
long as the Incurrence of such Financial Indebtedness is permitted under the terms
of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(iii) Financial Indebtedness of Topco owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or
Financial Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by Topco or by any
Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

an Obligor, such Financial Indebtedness must be unsecured and expressly
subordinated to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement to the prior
payment in full of the Obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement;

(B) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which
results in any such Financial Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person
other than Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary of Topco; and

(C) any sale or other transfer of any such Financial Indebtedness to a Person other
than Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary of Topco,

shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Financial
Indebtedness by Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, not
permitted as described in this clause (iii);

(iv) any Financial Indebtedness represented by (A) the Class A Loans and the Class B Loans

acquisition or other transaction pursuant to which such Financial Indebtedness was deemed
to be Incurred (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be greater than 2.0 to 1.0 after
giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition
or other transaction on a pro forma basis;

(vi) Financial Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and
Commodity Hedging Agreements entered into for bona fide hedging purposes of Topco or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and not for speculative purposes (as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors or senior management of Intermediate Holdco);

B Permitted Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock
of any Person owning such assets and (c) any Refinancing Financial Indebtedness in
respect of (a) or (b), in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken
together with the principal amount of all other Financial Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to
this clause (vii) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any time the greater of (A) £50.0

subsequent changes in value), actually received by Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries
in connection with such disposition;

covenant that was outstanding on the Sixth Closing Date or the Seventh Closing Date;

(viii) all Financial Indebtedness outstanding on the Seventh Closing Date under the Class A
Loans and the Class B Loans shall be deemed initially Incurred on the Seventh Closing
Date under clause (iv)(A) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first
paragraph of this covenant or clause (iv)(B) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and
without limiting any permitted refinancing pursuant to clause (iv)(C) of the second
paragraph of this covenant, may not be reclassified pursuant to clause (vii) of this
paragraph; and

(ix) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption
or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortisation of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Financial Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends on Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Preferred
Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Financial Indebtedness
due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Financial Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant.
The amount of any Financial Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (i) the accreted value thereof in the case
of any Financial Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (ii) the principal amount or liquidation
preference thereof, in the case of any other Financial Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Financial Indebtedness of
such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of Topco as of such date (and, if such
Financial Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, Topco shall be in default
of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Financial Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of Financial Indebtedness denominated in
another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Financial
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Financial Indebtedness, or, at the option of Topco, first committed, in
the case of Financial Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; _provided_ that (i) if such Financial
Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Financial Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and
such refinancing would cause the applicable sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall
be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Financial Indebtedness
does not exceed the principal amount of such Financial Indebtedness being refinanced; (ii) the Sterling Equivalent of
the principal amount of any such Financial Indebtedness outstanding on the Fourth Closing Date shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Fourth Closing Date, the Sterling Equivalent of the
principal amount of any such Financial Indebtedness outstanding on the Sixth Closing Date (that was not outstanding

294


-----

on the Fourth Closing Date) shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Sixth
Closing Date and the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Financial Indebtedness outstanding on
the Seventh Closing Date (that was not outstanding on the Fourth Closing Date or the Sixth Closing Date) shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Seventh Closing Date; and (iii) if and for so
long as any such Financial Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which
such Financial Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Financial Indebtedness, the
amount of such Financial Indebtedness, if denominated in sterling, will be the amount of the principal payment
required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Sterling Equivalent of such amount plus the
Sterling Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency
Agreement. For purposes of calculating compliance with clause (i) of the second paragraph (of this covenant or for
calculating the amount of Financial Indebtedness outstanding under any Credit Facility, to the extent a Credit Facility
is utilised for the purpose of Guaranteeing or cash collateralising any letter of credit or Guarantee, such Guarantee or
collateralising and issuance of such letter of credit or Guarantee shall be deemed to be a utilisation of such Credit
Facility permitted under clause (i) of the second paragraph above.

Subject to the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, any Borrower may at any time serve
written notice to the Issuer with a copy to the Borrower Security Trustee requesting from the Issuer such further and/or
additional term loan facilities, each in a maximum aggregate principal amount not exceeding the principal amount of
any issue of Class B Additional Notes issued by the Issuer to fund its obligations under the Class B Issuer/ Borrower
Loan Agreement in respect of the relevant additional Class B Facility (each an “Additional Class B Facility”) if the
following conditions are satisfied (as certified by the Borrower), or will be satisfied by the time of such issue:

(1) the aggregate amount of any Additional Class B Facility is to be for a minimum aggregate principal
amount of £5.0 million;

(2) the conditions to the issue by the Issuer of the corresponding Class B Additional Notes have been
satisfied, or will be satisfied by the time of such issue;

(3) the payment of interest and principal with respect to any such Additional Class B Facilities will rank
pari passu with or after any then outstanding Class B Facility; and

(4) the Incurrence of Financial Indebtedness under such Additional Class B Facility is permitted under
“— Limitation on Financial Indebtedness”.

Notwithstanding the provisions described above, the maximum amount of Financial Indebtedness that Topco
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur under the provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement shall not
be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount
of any Financial Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Financial Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency
from the Financial Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable
to the currencies in which such Refinancing Financial Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of the
relevant refinancing.

**Class B Restricted Payments**

Topco will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately thereafter therefrom);

(2) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be greater than 2.0 to 1.0 after giving effect, on a pro forma
basis, to such Class B Restricted Payment; and

(3) the aggregate amount of such Class B Restricted Payment and all other Class B Restricted Payments
made subsequent to the Fourth Closing Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted
Payments permitted by clauses (v) (without duplication of amounts paid pursuant to any other clause
of the definition of Permitted Payments) and (x) (and prior to the Existing Class B Loans Discharge

first day of the Accounting Period during which the Fourth Closing Date occurs to the end of the
most recently ended Accounting Period for which internal financial statements are available at the
time of the proposed Class B Restricted Payment (or, in the case where EBITDA for such period is
a negative, minus the amount by which EBITDA is less than zero); plus

(2) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined in accordance
with the next succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or marketable securities, received by
Topco from the issue or sale of its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated

otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or
Designated Preference Shares) of Topco subsequent to the Fourth Closing Date (other than (x) Net
Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received from an issuance or sale of

Subsidiary of Topco or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by Topco or any
Subsidiary of Topco for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by Topco or any Restricted
Subsidiary) by Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the Fourth Closing Date of any
Financial Indebtedness that has been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock of Topco (other
than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding
(plus the amount of any cash, and the fair market value (as determined in accordance with the next
succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or marketable securities, received by Topco or any
Restricted Subsidiary upon such conversion or exchange); plus

(4) the amount equal to the net reduction in Restricted Investments made by Topco or any of its

Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary of any such Restricted Investment, repayments of loans
or advances or other transfers of assets (including by way of dividend, distribution, interest
payments or returns of capital) to Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(ii) the redesignation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries (valued, in each
case, as provided in the definition of Investment) not to exceed, in the case of any
Unrestricted Subsidiary, the amount of Investments previously made by Topco or any
Restricted Subsidiary in such Unrestricted Subsidiary, which amount, in each case under
this clause (4), was included in the calculation of the amount of Class B Restricted
Payments referred to in clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant;

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in the preceding clause (1) of this definition to_
the extent that it is (at Topco’s option) included under this clause (4); plus

(5) the amount of the cash and fair market value (as determined in accordance with the next succeeding
paragraph) of property or assets or of marketable securities received by Topco or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with:

(i) the sale or other disposition (other than to Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary or an employee
stock ownership plan or trust established by Topco or any Subsidiary of Topco for the
benefit of its employees to the extent funded by Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary) of
Capital Stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary of Topco; and

(ii) any dividend or distribution made by an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Affiliate to Topco or a
Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in the preceding clause (1) to the extent that it_
is (at Topco’s option) included under this clause (5); provided further, however, that such amount
shall not exceed the amount of Class B Restricted Payments made in connection with such
Unrestricted Subsidiaries since the Fourth Closing Date pursuant to clause (3) above.

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence shall be the
fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of Intermediate Holdco.

“Cumulative Interest Expense” means, in respect of any Class B Restricted Payment, the sum of the
aggregate amount of Consolidated Interest Expense of Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the period from and
after the first day of the Accounting Period during which the Fourth Closing Date occurs to the end of Topco’s most
recently ended Accounting Period for which financial statements are available at the time of the proposed Class B
Restricted Payment.

Intermediate Holdco);

(xiii) Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the

such Class B Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by Topco or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Class B Restricted Payment. The fair market value

Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors of Intermediate Holdco acting in good
faith. Unsecured Financial Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be subordinated or junior to secured Financial
Indebtedness by virtue of its nature as unsecured Financial Indebtedness.

**Anti-layering**

Topco will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Financial Indebtedness
(including Permitted Financial Indebtedness) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Class A
Loans unless such Financial Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to or ranks pari passu

**Limitations on Liens**

Topco will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur,
assume or otherwise suffer to exist any Lien which secures any Financial Indebtedness (other than in the case of any
assets or property of any Restricted Subsidiary, Permitted Liens or, in the case of any assets or property of Topco,
Permitted Topco Liens or, in the case of any property or assets constituting Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens) on
any of its assets or property, now owned or hereafter acquired.

**Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries**

Topco will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary
to:

(i) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or
pay any Financial Indebtedness or other obligations owed to an Obligor;

(ii) make any loans or advances to an Obligor; or

(iii) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to an Obligor;

_provided_ that (A) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (B) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary to other
Financial Indebtedness Incurred by Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions described in the paragraph above will not prohibit:

(i) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (A) any Credit Facility or (B) any other
agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Fourth Closing
Date, including the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Class B Issuer/Borrower

Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by Topco or
any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital
Stock or Financial Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any
portion of the funds utilised to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions
pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by Topco
or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into Topco or any Restricted
Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such
date;

refinancing of Financial Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances,
an agreement or instrument referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph or this clause
(iii) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other
modification to an agreement referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph or this clause
(iii); _provided,_ _however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such_
Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favourable
in any material respect to the holders of the Class B Notes, taken as a whole, than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to
which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of Intermediate Holdco);

(iv) any encumbrance or restriction:

301


-----

(A) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, licence or similar contract, or the
assignment or transfer of any lease, licence or other contract;

(B) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted
under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or securing Financial
Indebtedness of Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Class B

restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges,
charges or other security agreements; or

(C) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests
set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of Topco or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(v) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalised
Lease Obligations permitted under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, in each
case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property so acquired or any
encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions
on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

(vi) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its
property or assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect
sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such
Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending
the closing of such sale or disposition;

(vii) customary provisions in leases, licences, joint venture, concession or permit agreements
and other similar agreements and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of
business;

(viii) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any
applicable rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

any Financial Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Sixth Closing Date,
or with respect to the Class B6 Notes, the Seventh Closing Date, as described in “—
_Limitation on Financial Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in_
any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favourable to
the holders of the Class B Notes than (A) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in
the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement, together with the security documents associated therewith as in effect on the
Sixth Closing Date, or with respect to the Class B6 Notes, the Seventh Closing Date; (B)
any encumbrance or restriction contained in any Credit Facility, together with the security
documents associated therewith as in effect on the Sixth Closing Date, or with respect to
the Class B6 Notes, the Seventh Closing Date or (C) as is customary in comparable

substantially all of the properties and assets of Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole in one or more
related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(i) either:

(A) Topco is the surviving corporation; or

(B) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than

(I) a member state of Pre-Expansion European Union;

(II) Switzerland;

(III) Guernsey;

(IV) the Cayman Islands; or

otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to
Topco, (b) any Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or

not such Obligor is the surviving Person) or (B) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its assets to, another Person, unless:

(i) (A) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Class B Loan Default, Share
Enforcement Event or Class B Loan Event of Default, as the case may be, exists and (B)
the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by
or surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of such Obligor
under the Class B Notes, the Class B Loans, the Class B Issuer/ Borrower Loan Agreement,

(ii) To the extent required by the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the

part of its properties and assets to another Obligor or Topco and (ii) an Obligor may consolidate or otherwise combine
with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organised for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Obligor,

**Asset Sales**

Topco will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly make any Asset
Sale unless:

(i) Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to
be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors of Intermediate Holdco, of the shares and assets
subject to such Asset Sale (including for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Sale is a
Permitted Asset Swap); and

(ii) in any such Asset Sale, or series of related Asset Sales (except to the extent the Asset Sale
is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Sale
(excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Financial
Indebtedness) received by Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in
the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments. For the purposes of
this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(A) the assumption by the transferee of Financial Indebtedness of Topco or Financial
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of
Topco or an Obligor) and the release of Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary from
all liability on such Financial Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale;

(B) securities, notes or other obligations received by Topco or any Restricted
Subsidiary of Topco from the transferee that are converted by Topco or such
Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following
the closing of such Asset Sale;

(C) Financial Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that Topco and each other
Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such
Financial Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale;

(D) consideration consisting of Financial Indebtedness of Topco (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Fourth Closing Date and that is
cancelled from Persons who are not Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(E) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by Topco or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken
together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to
this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of £36.0
million and 2.0% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each item of
Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); and

(iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Sale is applied by
Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(A) to the extent Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is
required by the terms of any Financial Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary),
(1) to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase any Financial Indebtedness under the
Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, any Financial Indebtedness Incurred
under clause (i) of the second paragraph described under “— _Limitation on_
_Financial Indebtedness” (or any Refinancing Financial Indebtedness in respect_
thereof) or any other Financial Indebtedness secured by a first priority Lien on the
Collateral within 365 days from the later of (x) the date of such Asset Sale and (y)
the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection
with any prepayment or repayment of Financial Indebtedness pursuant to this

304


-----

clause (1), Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Financial
Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) (except in the case
of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) to be permanently reduced in
an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid or repaid; (2) to prepay, repay,
purchase or redeem Financial Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not
a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets which do not constitute
Collateral (in each case, other than Subordinated Indebtedness of Topco or a
Guarantor or Indebtedness that is owed to Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary); (3)
to purchase the Class B Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of the Class B
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount
of the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but
not including, the date of purchase, on such sub-class of Class B Notes; or (4) to
prepay, repay, redeem or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more
than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment or purchase;
_provided that Topco shall redeem repay or repurchase Pari Passu Indebtedness_
pursuant to this clause (4) only if the Borrowers make (at such time or
subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the holders of the Class
B Notes of each sub-class to purchase their Class B Notes in accordance with the
provisions set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer for an aggregate principal
amount of Class B Notes of the relevant sub-class at least equal to the proportion
that (i) the total aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes outstanding in such
sub-class bears to (ii) the sum of the total aggregate principal amount of Class B
Notes outstanding in such sub-class plus the total aggregate principal amount
outstanding of such Pari Passu Indebtedness as well as the total aggregate
principal amount of any other sub-class of Class B Notes; or

(B) to the extent Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary elects to invest in or commit to
invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional
Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by Topco or
another Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (1) the date of
such Asset Sale and (2) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; _provided,_
however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a
definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors
of Intermediate Holdco that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy
this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of
such 365th day; and provided further, that, if the Asset Sale relates to Collateral,
to the extent such Additional Assets are of the same type as any asset constituting
Collateral, such Additional Assets are substantially, simultaneously with their
acquisition, pledged under the Borrower Security Documents, with the security
interest on such Additional Assets securing the Class B Loans and the Class B
Notes with the same priority with respect to the Class B Loans and the Class B
Notes as the security interest on the Collateral subject to the Asset Sale, provided
that in the case of Net Available Cash received from an Asset Sale of Collateral,
none of the Obligors may apply such Net Available Cash to repay Financial
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not an Obligor; or

(C) consummate any combination of the foregoing,

_provided further_ that pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in
accordance with clauses (A), (B) or (C), Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
temporarily reduce Financial Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in
any manner not prohibited by the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

Prior to the Existing Class B Loans Discharge Date, any Net Available Cash from Asset Sales that is not
applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in clause (iii) above will be deemed to constitute
“Excess Proceeds” under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

305


-----

On and after the Existing Class B Loans Discharge Date:

(a) to the extent that the Consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeds 7.5 to 1.00, any Net Available Cash from
Asset Sales that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in
clause (iii) above;

(b) to the extent that the Consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeds 7.0 to 1.00 but does not exceed 7.5 to
1.00, 50% of any Net Available Cash from Asset Sales that is not applied or invested or committed
to be applied or invested as provided in clause (iii) above; or

(c) to the extent that the Consolidated Leverage Ratio does not exceed 7.0 to 1.00, 0% of any Net
Available Cash from Asset Sales that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or
invested as provided in clause (iii) above,

will be deemed to constitute Excess Proceeds under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement. On or
prior to the 366th day (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in clause (iii)(B) above has been entered
into) after the later of (A) an Asset Sale and (B) the receipt of Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement exceeds £20.0 million, the Borrowers will be required
to make an offer (or procure that an offer is made) (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of the Class B Notes and, to
the extent the Borrowers elect, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase, prepay or
redeem the maximum principal amount of the Class B Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset
Sale Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of each sub-class of
Class B Notes in an amount at least equal to (and, in the case of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no
more than) 100% of the principal amount of such sub-class of Class B Notes and 100% of the principal amount of
Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase, the applicable Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amount, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon,
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this covenant or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness,
as applicable, and in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

Each Asset Sale Offer will remain open for a period of at least 20 Business Days following its commencement
and not more than 30 Business Days, except to the extent that a longer period is required by applicable law (the “Offer
**Period”). No later than three Business Days after the termination of the Offer Period (the “Purchase Date”), the**
Borrowers will apply all Excess Proceeds (the “Offer Amount”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of Class
B Notes and, if applicable, any such Pari Passu Indebtedness (on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount of
Class B Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered, if applicable) or, if less than the Offer Amount has been
tendered, all Class B Notes and, if applicable, other Financial Indebtedness tendered in response to the Asset Sale
Offer. Payment for any Class B Notes and, if applicable, any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, so purchased will be made
in the same manner as interest payments are made. If the Purchase Date is on or after an interest record date and on or
before the related interest payment date, any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the Person in whose
name a Class B Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be
payable to holders of Class B Notes who tender Class B Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer.

Upon the commencement of an Asset Sale Offer, the Borrowers shall (or upon request of the Borrowers, the
Issuer shall) send, by first class mail, a notice to the Issuer and (for the purposes of information only) to the Borrower
Security Trustee. The notice, which will govern the terms of the Asset Sale Offer, will state:

(i) that the Asset Sale Offer is being made pursuant to this covenant and the length of time the
Asset Sale Offer will remain open;

(ii) the Offer Amount, the purchase price and the Purchase Date;

(iii) that any Class B Note not tendered or accepted for payment will continue to accrue interest;

(iv) that, unless the Borrowers default in making such payment, any Class B Note accepted for
payment pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Purchase
Date;

(v) that holders of Class B Notes electing to have a Class B Note purchased pursuant to an
Asset Sale Offer may elect to have Class B Notes purchased in integral multiples of £1,000
only (provided that Class B Notes of £100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and
not in part);

306


-----

(vi) that holders of Class B Notes electing to have Class B Notes purchased pursuant to any
Asset Sale Offer will be required to transfer the Class B Notes to the nominated account as
specified in the notice of the Asset Sale Offer;

(vii) that holders of Class B Notes will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Issuer and/or
the Borrowers receive (at such facsimile number or address as specified in the notice of the
Asset Sale Offer), not later than the expiration of the Offer Period, a facsimile transmission
or letter setting forth the name of the holder of Class B Notes, the principal amount of Class
B Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing its election
to have the Class B Notes purchased;

(viii) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness
surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the Offer Amount, the Borrowers will select the
Class B Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on
the principal amount of Class B Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered (with
such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Borrowers so that only Class B
Notes in denominations of £1,000, or integral multiples thereof, will be purchased
(provided that Class B Notes of £100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not
in part)); and

(ix) that holders of Class B Notes of any sub-class whose Class B Notes are being purchased
only in part will be issued new Class B Notes of such sub-class equal in principal amount
to the unpurchased portion of the Class B Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion
must be equal to £100,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of £1,000 in excess
thereof.

On or before the Purchase Date, the Borrowers will, to the extent lawful:

(i) accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Offer Amount of Class
B Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer, or if less than the
Offer Amount has been tendered, all Class B Notes tendered;

(ii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Issuer (in satisfaction, prepayment and discharge of
a pro rata portion of each Borrower’s liability under the applicable Class B Loans) the
Class B Notes properly accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating that such
Class B Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Borrowers in
accordance with the terms of this covenant and the Issuer shall then deliver such Class B
Notes to the Principal Paying Agent and shall take all other action and deliver all
documents and certificates required under the Note Trust Deed or required by the Principal
Paying Agent to effect cancellation of the Class B Notes; and

(iii) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the purchase price in respect
of all Class B Notes or portions of Class B Notes properly tendered by such holder for
payment into the account of each tendering holder of Class B Notes (as specified in such
holder’s acceptance of the Asset Sale Offer) no later than five days after the Purchase Date.

The Issuer shall cooperate with the Borrowers in relation to any Asset Sale Offer, and the Borrowers shall
bear the cost of such Asset Sale Offer (including, without limitation, by delivering such notices to holders of Class B
Notes as the Borrowers may require in order to enable the Borrowers to comply with the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph).

If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, Topco and its Restricted
Subsidiaries may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement. If the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes tendered into (or to be redeemed in connection
with) such Asset Sale Offer and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds
the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Class B Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis, based on the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes of each
sub-class and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds will be reset at zero.

307


-----

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Class B Notes is denominated
in a currency other than sterling, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Class B Notes shall not exceed the net
amount of funds in sterling that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into sterling.

Following any acceptance by the holders of Class B Notes of any Asset Sale Offer, the Borrowers will be
required to prepay the applicable Class B Loans at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any) in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any) of the relevant
sub-class of Class B Notes so tendered in such Asset Sale Offer.

**Transactions with Affiliates**

Topco will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to or sell, lease,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into
or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or Guarantee with, or for the
benefit of, any Affiliate of Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving
aggregate payments or consideration in excess of £10.0 million, unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favourable
to Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be
obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the
agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not
such an Affiliate; and

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of £25.0
million, the terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of
the Board of Directors of Intermediate Holdco.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (ii) of the
first paragraph of this covenant if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors.
If there are no Disinterested Directors, any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements
set forth in this covenant if Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to the Borrower
Security Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to Topco or such
Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that the terms are not materially less favourable to
Topco or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by
Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s length basis.

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the
provisions of the first paragraph of this covenant:

(i) any Class B Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the provisions described
in “— _Class B Restricted Payments”, any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to_
clause (ix)(B) of the definition of Permitted Payments) or any Permitted Investment (other
than Permitted Investments as defined in clauses (a)(ii), (b) and (o) of the definition
thereof);

(ii) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other
securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to,
or the funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting,
collective bargaining or benefit plan, programme, agreement or arrangement, related trust
or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or
other rights to purchase Capital Stock of Topco, any Restricted Subsidiary of Topco or any
Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans,
participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation,
health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans,
programmes or arrangements) or payments of customary fees and reimbursements of
expenses to, or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or
consultants approved by the Board of Directors, in each case in the ordinary course of
business;

(iii) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

308

(iv) any transaction between or among Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or entity
that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among
Restricted Subsidiaries;

(v) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and
pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of
Topco, any Restricted Subsidiary of Topco or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly
and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or
employees);

(vi) the entry into and performance of obligations of Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for
purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Fourth Closing
Date, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented,
extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of
this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the holders of the Class B Notes
in any material respect in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Topco or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary and the entry into and performance of any registration
rights or other listing agreement in connection with any Public Offering;

(vii) the execution, delivery and performance of any tax sharing agreement to the extent not
prohibited by the definition of Permitted Payments or the formation and maintenance of
any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the
ordinary course of business;

(viii) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, providers of employees or other
labour (including, without limitation, with respect to the management, development,
maintenance or refurbishment of real property and other related services), suppliers or
purchasers or sellers of goods or services (including, without limitation, with respect to
insurance and reinsurance services), in each case in the ordinary course of business, which
are fair to Topco or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of
the Board of Directors or the senior management of Topco or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favourable than those that could reasonably have been
obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(ix) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among Topco or any
Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of Topco that would constitute an Affiliate
Transaction solely because Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of Topco or
a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an Equity Interest
in or otherwise controls such Affiliate;

(x) (A) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated
Preference Shares) of Topco or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital
Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; _provided_ that the interest rate and other
financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of
the members of the Board of Directors in their reasonable determination and (B) any
amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder
Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement;

(xi) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (xii) hereof, (A)
payments by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to any Parent or Permitted Holder
(whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent) of customary annual
management, consulting, monitoring or advisory fees and related expenses and (B)
customary payments by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to any Parent or

Incurred by such Parent or Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect
investment in Topco and its Subsidiaries;

(xiii) the Incurrence or amendment of any Subordinated Shareholder Funding;

(xiv) transactions between any of the Obligors and any person, a director of which is also a
director of the relevant Obligor or any direct or indirect parent of such Obligor; provided,
_however, that such director abstains from voting as a director of the relevant Obligor or_
such direct or indirect parent, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other
person;

(xv) any Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisation;

(xvi) the Transaction Documents;

(xvii) any transaction that is, directly or indirectly, related to the Ireland Site or an Additional
Site and is otherwise permitted by the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

rights agreement or purchase agreement related thereto) to which it (or any Parent of the
Topco) is a party as of the Fourth Closing Date and any similar agreements which it (or
any Parent of Topco) may enter into thereafter; _provided_ that the existence of, or the
performance by the Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or such Parent) of
obligations under any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any
similar agreement entered into after the Fourth Closing Date shall only be permitted by this
clause (xx) to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not
otherwise disadvantageous in any material respect in the good faith judgment of Topco to
the Class B Lenders when taken as a whole; and

(xx) (i) the Transactions, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of Topco or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated
by, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument
in effect as of or on the Fourth Closing Date or described in “Certain Relationships and
_Related Party Transactions” in the 2017 Class B Notes Offering Memorandum, as these_
agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended,
renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of
this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Class B Noteholders in any
material respect, and (iii) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other
listing agreement.

**Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Certain Financial Indebtedness**

Topco will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to
Guarantee the payment of any Class A Loans, Additional Class A Loans or Financial Indebtedness Incurred under a
Credit Facility of a Guarantor or a Borrower (or, in each case, any Refinancing Financial Indebtedness Incurred in
respect thereof) unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers an accession agreement to the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement providing for the Guarantee of the payment of the Class B Loans and the
Class B Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Guarantee will be pari passu with or junior to such Restricted
Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such Class A Loans, Additional Class A Loans or Financial Indebtedness Incurred under a
Credit Facility (or, in each case, any Refinancing Financial Indebtedness Incurred in respect thereof).

Each such additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognise certain defences generally available

assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of
creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to any Guarantees of any Restricted Subsidiary:

(i) existing on the Fourth Closing Date; or

(ii) given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided
profits of not less than £250.0 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such Guarantee
was given, of at least “A” or the equivalent thereof by S&P and Fitch, in connection with
the operation of cash management programmes established for the benefit of the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Topco shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee
the payment of the Class B Loans or the Class B Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary
would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in:

(i) a violation of applicable law which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided
through measures reasonably available to Topco or such Restricted Subsidiary; or

(ii) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary.

**Reports**

For so long as any Class B Loan is outstanding, Topco will provide to the Borrower Security Trustee and the
Class B Note Trustee (for the benefit of the Class B Noteholders) the following reports:

(i) within 120 days after the end of Intermediate Holdco’s financial year, annual reports
containing the following information: (A) audited consolidated balance sheets of
Intermediate Holdco as of the end of the two most recent financial years and audited
consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of Intermediate Holdco for
the two most recent financial years, including complete footnotes to such financial
statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (B) pro
forma income information and balance sheet information of Intermediate Holdco (which,
for the avoidance of doubt shall not include the provision of a full income statement or
balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes,
for any material acquisitions or dispositions that represent greater than 20% of the
consolidated revenues, EBITDA, or assets of Intermediate Holdco or recapitalisations that
have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed financial year as to which
such annual report relates; (C) an operating and financial review of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity and capital resources of Intermediate Holdco, and a discussion of material
commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies and (D) a description of
material risk factors and material recent developments of the Group.

(ii) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three financial quarters in each
financial year of Intermediate Holdco, all quarterly reports of Intermediate Holdco
containing the following information: (A) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the
most recent quarter and year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance
sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods, together with condensed footnote
disclosure; (B) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of Intermediate
Holdco (which, for the avoidance of doubt shall not include the provision of a full income
statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions or dispositions that represents greater
than 20% of the consolidated revenues, EBITDA or assets of Intermediate Holdco or
recapitalisations that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant quarter, in each case
unless pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clauses (i)
and (iii) or this clause (ii); (C) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations and financial condition,

311


-----

EBITDA, and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of Intermediate Holdco;
and (D) material recent developments of Intermediate Holdco;

(iii) within ten days after the occurrence of (A) a material acquisition, disposition or
restructuring; (B) any senior management change at Topco; (C) any change in the auditors
of Intermediate Holdco; (D) the entering into an agreement that would result in a Class B
Change of Control; or (E) any material events that any Obligor announces publicly, in each
case, a report containing a description of such events; and

(iv) on each Semi-Annual Investor Reporting Date, CP Opco must provide details of a
telephone conference into which the Class A Noteholders and Class B Noteholders may
dial, on which the senior management of the Obligors must present their financial results
for the relevant period, provided that CP Opco shall only be required to hold telephone
conferences if so required under the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement,

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above will not be required to (A) contain any_
reconciliation to U.S. GAAP or (B) include separate financial statements for any Obligors or any Subsidiaries of
Intermediate Holdco that are not Obligors.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that material differences exist between the results of operations
or financial condition of Topco and Intermediate Holdco, the annual and quarterly reports shall give a reasonably
detailed description of such differences. Topco may at any time elect to become the reporting entity in place of
Intermediate Holdco, after which election, references to the “Intermediate Holdco” in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) and the
proviso above shall be deemed to refer to Topco.

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS. Except as provided for above, no report
need include separate financial statements for the Obligors or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations
or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the 2017 Class B Notes Offering Memorandum,
the 2020 Class B Notes Offering Memorandum or in this Offering Memorandum.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Borrower Security Trustee of the reports specified in
clause (i), (ii) and (iii) above, Topco shall (1) make available copies of all reports required on its website or (2)
otherwise provide substantially comparable public availability of such reports (as determined by the Board of Directors
of Intermediate Holdco in good faith).

For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Class B Note Trustee nor the Borrower Security Trustee shall be
responsible for monitoring or confirming the validity or accuracy of the reports or information delivered pursuant to
this covenant or compliance by Topco with its obligations under this covenant.

In addition, Topco shall furnish to the Class B Noteholders and to prospective investors, upon the request of
such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so
long as the Class B Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under
the Securities Act.

Subject to compliance with the immediately following paragraph of this covenant, in the event that, and for
so long as, the equity securities of Topco or any Parent or IPO Entity are listed on any Qualified Stock Exchange and
the listed entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted
to trading on such Qualified Stock Exchange, for so long as it elects, Topco will make available to the Borrower
Security Trustee and the Class B Note Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that it
or such Parent or IPO Entity is, or would be, required to file with such Qualified Stock Exchange. Upon complying
with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such requirements require Topco or any Parent or IPO Entity to
prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other reports with such Qualified Stock Exchange, Topco
will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Topco may also comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this covenant
by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent of Topco so long as such reports (if an
annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of the
first paragraph of this covenant as if references to the Intermediate Holdco therein were references to such Parent and
(b) include condensed consolidated financial information together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent; (ii)
Intermediate Holdco and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Parent on
a combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts. Upon complying with the

312


-----

foregoing requirement, Topco will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding
paragraphs.

**Conduct of Business/Business Activities**

The Obligors will not engage in any business other than a Class B Permitted Business, except to the extent
as would not be material to the Obligors, taken as a whole.

**Limitation on Holding Company Activities**

(i) (a) with respect to Topco, the ownership of Capital Stock of Holdco and (b) with respect
to Holdco, the ownership of Intermediate Holdco;

(ii) conduct of their business as holding companies, including the provision of administrative
services (excluding treasury services but including the on-lending of monies to their

customarily provided by a holding company to its Subsidiaries and the ownership of assets
necessary to provide such services;

(iii) activities undertaken with the purpose of fulfilling rights and obligations arising under the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party, asset and liabilities under the Transaction
Documents, and professional fees and administration costs in connection therewith and
otherwise in the ordinary course of business as a holding company;

(iv) credit balances in bank accounts and Investments in cash and Cash Equivalents;

(v) subject to the provisions described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant,
Incurring Financial Indebtedness as described in “— _Limitation on Financial_
_Indebtedness” (including activities reasonably incidental thereto, including performance of_
the terms and conditions of such Financial Indebtedness, to the extent such activities are
otherwise permissible under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) and the
granting of Liens as described in “— Limitations on Liens”;

(vi) making Investments in the Class B Notes or Financial Indebtedness as described in “—
_Limitation on Financial Indebtedness”;_

(vii) directly related or reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of its or
its Subsidiaries’ corporate existence or for the purpose of transferring such property and
assets to any Parent or other Person;

(viii) activities pursuant to or in connection with the Transactions; or

(ix) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are de minimis in nature or ancillary
to or related to those listed in this covenant.

Neither Topco nor Holdco will, directly or indirectly, Incur any Financial Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness, but excluding any outstanding intercompany Financial Indebtedness existing on the Fourth Closing
Date) other than (i) the Incurrence of obligations or liabilities arising by operation of law, (ii) the Incurrence of
liabilities to pay Taxes and paying Taxes, (iii) the Incurrence such as may arise of liabilities under the Topco Payment
Undertaking of the Topco Transaction Documents, and neither Topco nor Holdco will issue any Disqualified Stock.

Neither Topco nor Holdco will, directly or indirectly, create, Incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to
exist or become effective any Lien of any kind securing Financial Indebtedness upon any of its property or assets,
now owned or hereinafter acquired, except to secure any Permitted Topco Lien.

Neither Topco nor Holdco will take, or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which action or
omission would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the collateral granted under
the relevant Topco Security Documents (it being understood that the Incurrence of Liens on the Topco Security
permitted by the definition of Permitted Topco Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the
security interest with respect to the Topco Security) for the benefit of the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer,
and neither Topco nor Holdco will grant to any Person other than the Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the
Issuer and the other beneficiaries described in the Topco Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any

313


-----

Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in the Topco Security; provided that (a) nothing in this
provision shall restrict the discharge or release of the Topco Security in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement, the Topco Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and (b) Topco and Holdco may Incur Permitted Topco Liens; provided further, however, that, subject to
the foregoing, Topco Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified, replaced, or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking
over the same assets) unless Topco or Holdco, as applicable, contemporaneously with such amendment, extension,
replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, renewal or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the assets), delivers to the Borrower Security Trustee (i) a certificate from the Board
of Directors or chief financial officer of the relevant Person (acting in good faith) that confirms the solvency of the
Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, replacement, supplement, modification or release, or (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications),
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the Topco Payment
Undertaking created under the Topco Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
modified, replaced or released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to
immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or
release and retaking.

**Impairment of Security Interest**

Topco will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission would have the result of materially impairing the security
interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by
the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security
interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Borrower Security Trustee and the holders of the Class B
Notes, and Topco will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other
than the Borrower Security Trustee, for the benefit of the Borrower Security Trustee and the Class B Notes and the
other beneficiaries described in the Borrower Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this provision
shall restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement, the Borrower Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and (b) Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens; provided further, however, that,
subject to the foregoing, no Borrower Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced, or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets) unless Topco contemporaneously with such amendment, extension,
replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, renewal or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the assets), delivers to the Borrower Security Trustee (i) a certificate from the Board
of Directors or chief financial officer of the relevant Person (acting in good faith) that confirms the solvency of the
Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, replacement, supplement, modification or release, or (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications),
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the Class B Loans created
under the Borrower Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced
or released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation imperfection or new
hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking.

At the direction of Topco and without the consent of the holders of the Class B Notes, the Borrower Security
Trustee may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Borrower Security Documents to:

(i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein;

(ii) subject to compliance with the provisions described in the first paragraph of this covenant,
provide for Permitted Collateral Liens;

314


-----

(iii) add to the Collateral; or

(iv) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of
the Class B Notes in any material respect.

In the event that Topco complies with the provisions described in “— Impairment of Security Interest”, the
Borrower Security Trustee shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release with no need for instructions from
the holders of Class B Notes.

**Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Acquisitions**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Class B Loans, in each case in
connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Share
Enforcement Event or Class B Loan Default or Class B Loan Event of Default shall, at the option of Topco, be the
date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall
be calculated with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma provisions set
forth in the definitions of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Senior
Secured Leverage Ratio after giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and the other transactions to be
entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Financial Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to
consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any
basket or ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of
fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in EBITDA of Topco or the target company)
subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition
Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely
for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Acquisition is permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets
or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or related transactions;
provided further that if Topco elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive
agreement, any such transactions (including any incurrence of Financial Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
therefrom) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding
thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Class B Loans after the date of such agreement
and before the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition.

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

At the request of Topco, in connection with the Incurrence or refinancing by Topco or its Restricted
Subsidiaries of any Financial Indebtedness secured or permitted to be secured on the Collateral, Topco, the relevant
Restricted Subsidiaries and the Borrower Security Trustee shall enter into an intercreditor or similar agreement (an
“Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) with the creditors of such Financial Indebtedness (or their duly authorised
representatives) on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or on terms not materially less
favourable to the holders of the Class B Notes), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to the
application of the proceeds of the collateral held thereunder and the means of enforcement; _provided_ that such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Borrower Security Trustee or, in
the opinion of the Borrower Security Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the
Borrower Security Trustee under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement. As
used herein, the term Intercreditor Agreement shall include references to any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that
supplements or replaces the Intercreditor Agreement.

At the written direction of Topco and without the consent of the holders of the Class B Notes, the Borrower
Security Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to:

(i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement;

(ii) increase the amount or types of Financial Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that
may be Incurred by Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries that are subject to any such
agreement (provided that such Financial Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) (including the addition of provisions relating to
new Financial Indebtedness ranking junior or pari passu in right of payment with the Class
B Loans and the Class B Notes);

315


-----

(iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iv) further secure the Class B Loans (including any Additional Class B Loans) in accordance
with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(v) make provision for equal and rateable pledges of the Collateral to secure Class B
Additional Notes and any Additional Class B Loans or to implement any Permitted
Collateral Liens;

(vi) grant any Additional Class B Facility or amend any existing Class B Facility to provide for
further advances; and/or

(vii) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of
the Class B Notes in any material respect. Topco shall not otherwise direct the Borrower
Security Trustee to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the
consent of holders of the relevant sub-class of Class B Notes of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Class B Notes of such sub-class then outstanding, except as
otherwise permitted as described in “— Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the
terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and Topco may only direct the Borrower Security
Trustee to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any
personal obligations on the Borrower Security Trustee or, in the opinion of the Borrower
Security Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the
Borrower Security Trustee under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement relating to
the Class B Loans, the Class B Notes or any Intercreditor Agreement.

Each holder of the Class B Notes, by accepting a Class B Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of any Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the
future pursuant to the provisions described herein).

**SHARE ENFORCEMENT EVENT AND CLASS B LOAN EVENT OF DEFAULT**

**Share Enforcement Event**

For so long as any Class A Loans or Additional Class A Loans are outstanding, each of the following is a
“Share Enforcement Event” under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement:

(i) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Class B Loan
when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(ii) if any amount (including, without limitation, any principal amount or premium of a Class
B Loan) remains outstanding (whether or not then due and payable) under a Class B Loan

amount of the outstanding Class B Notes with Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries’
obligations described in “— Class B Change of Control” (in each case, other than a failure
to purchase Class B Notes which will constitute a Share Enforcement Event under clause
(ii) above);

(vi) failure to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Borrower Security Trustee on
behalf of the holders of the Class B Notes or by the holders of at least 30% in principal
amount of the outstanding Class B Notes with Topco and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ other

rights described in “— Certain Covenants — Class B Financial Covenant — Cure right”;

316


-----

(vii) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or
by which there may be secured or evidenced any Financial Indebtedness for money
borrowed by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is
Guaranteed by Topco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Financial
Indebtedness owed to Topco or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Financial
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(A) is caused by a failure to pay principal on such Financial Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Financial
Indebtedness (“Payment Default”); or

(B) results in the acceleration of such Financial Indebtedness prior to its maturity
(“Cross-Acceleration”),

and, in each case, (I) the aggregate principal amount of any such Financial
Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Financial
Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of
which has been so accelerated, equals £25.0 million or more and (II) other than a
Payment Default with respect to Financial Indebtedness Incurred under the Class
A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or under any Credit Facility;

(viii) Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of
Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole constitutes a Significant Subsidiary pursuant
to or within the meaning of Bankruptcy Law:

(A) commences a voluntary case;

(B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case;

(C) consents to the appointment of a custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its
property; or

(D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;

(ix) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:

(A) is for relief against Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole
constitutes a Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case;

(B) appoints a custodian of Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole
constitutes a Significant Subsidiary or for all or substantially all of the property
of Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group
of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary; or

(C) orders the liquidation of Topco or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole
constitutes a Significant Subsidiary,

and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days;

taken as a whole constitutes a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of £25.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has
acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a
period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final;

(xi) any security interest under the Borrower Security Documents on any material Collateral
shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the
terms of the relevant Borrower Security Document and the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the

317


-----

Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or the release or amendment of any such security
interest in accordance with the terms of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or
such Borrower Security Document or any such security interest created thereunder shall be
declared invalid or unenforceable or Topco shall assert in writing that any such security
interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Class B Loan Default continues for ten
days;

(xii) any Class B Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with
the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or Topco or a Guarantor denies or disaffirms
its obligations under its Class B Guarantee in writing, other than in accordance with the
terms thereof or upon release of the Class B Guarantee in accordance with the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement; and

(xiii) a Class B Note Event of Default (not giving effect, for these purposes, to the provisions of
Condition 11.2 of the Class B Conditions) or a Class B Trigger Event has occurred (subject
to any relevant grace period or cure rights).

However, a default under any of the provisions described under clauses (v), (vi), (vii) or (x) above will not
constitute a Share Enforcement Event until the Borrower Security Trustee or the holders of 30% in principal amount
of the outstanding Class B Notes notify Topco of the default and, with respect to clauses (v), (vi), (vii) and (x), Topco
does not cure such default (or procures that such default is cured) within the time specified in clauses (v), (vi), (vii) or
(x), as applicable, after receipt of such notice.

In the event of a declaration of enforcement of the Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco Security
Documents because a Share Enforcement Event described in clause (vii) above has occurred and is continuing, the
declaration of enforcement of the Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco Security Documents shall be
automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Share Enforcement Event pursuant
to clause (vii) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Financial Indebtedness, or the Financial
Indebtedness that gave rise to such Share Enforcement Event shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after
the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the declaration of enforcement of the
Topco Payment Undertaking and the Topco Security Documents would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction and (2) any other then existing Share Enforcement Events have been cured or waived.

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will provide that (i) if a Share Enforcement Event occurs for
a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such
Initial Default is cured, such Share Enforcement Event for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in
connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Share Enforcement Event
for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants—Reports”
or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or
certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

If a Share Enforcement Event occurs and is continuing, the Borrower Security Trustee acting upon the
instructions of the Issuer Security Trustee as directed by the Class B Note Trustee, who shall be required to act if
directed by the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Class B Notes, may by notice to Topco
enforce the Topco Payment Undertaking and Topco Security Documents in accordance with their terms and the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Class B Loan Event of Default**

If at any time either (i) no amounts remain outstanding under any Class A Loans or Additional Class A Loans
or (ii) an acceleration of the amounts that remain outstanding under any Class A Loans has occurred, each of the Share
Enforcement Events set out in “— Share Enforcement Event” above will also constitute a “Class B Loan Event of
**Default”.**

In addition, whether or not any amounts remain outstanding under any Class A Loans or Additional Class A
Loans, any default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Class B Loan borrowed under
the Class B Issuer/ Borrower Loan Agreement when due on the applicable Class B Loan Final Maturity Date shall be
a Class B Loan Event of Default.

318


-----

If a Class B Loan Event of Default (other than a Class B Loan Event of Default described in clauses (viii) or
(ix) of the first paragraph of “— Share Enforcement Event”, above) occurs and is continuing, the Borrower Security
Trustee by notice to Topco on the instruction of the Issuer Security Trustee (who acts on the instructions of the Class
B Note Trustee, as directed by the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Class B Notes) in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, may declare the principal or premium, if any, and accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Class B Loans to be due and payable. Upon such a
declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, the applicable Class B Loan Deferred Interest
Amounts, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately.

If a Class B Loan Event of Default described in clauses (viii) or (ix) of the first paragraph of “— Share
_Enforcement Event” above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest,_
the applicable Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Class B Loans
will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Borrower
Security Trustee or any holders of Class B Notes.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Class B Loans because a Class B Loan Event of Default
described in clause (vii) of the first paragraph of “— Share Enforcement Event” above has occurred and is continuing,
the declaration of acceleration of the Class B Loans shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment
default triggering such Class B Loan Event of Default pursuant to clause (vii) shall be remedied or cured, or waived
by the holders of the Financial Indebtedness, or the Financial Indebtedness that gave rise to such Class B Loan Event
of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto
and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Class B Loans would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Class B Loan Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal,
premium or interest on the Class B Loans that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Class B Loans,
have been cured or waived.

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver
a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will
also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the
time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice
or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement shall be deemed to be
cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even
though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

No Class B Loan Event of Default may occur with respect to the Class B Loans while any amounts remain
outstanding under any of the Class A Loans (until after an acceleration of the Class A Loans) although this is without
prejudice to the ability of the Borrower Security Trustee, at the direction of the Class B Noteholders, to enforce the
security granted pursuant to the Topco Security Documents in certain circumstances including, without limitation,
where there has been a failure to pay cash interest on the Class B4 Loan prior to the Class B4 Loan Expected Maturity
Date. on the Class B5 Loan prior to the Class B5 Loan Expected Maturity Date or on the Class B6 Loan prior to the
Class B6 Loan Expected Maturity Date or a failure to repay principal and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon on
such date. Where there is such a failure to pay and for so long as such Class B Loan remains outstanding thereafter
(whether or not security is being enforced), any overdue amount of principal or interest and such Class B Loan will
bear interest at the interest rates set out in the second and third paragraphs under “— Interest — Payment of interest”
above, as applicable.

**AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS**

**Procedure**

Any term of the Class B Finance Documents may be amended or waived with the agreement of the Borrowers
(or CP Opco on their behalf), the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement.

Each Guarantor agrees to (and authorises CP Opco to execute on its behalf) any amendment or waiver
allowed by this covenant which is agreed to by the Borrowers (or CP Opco on their behalf). This includes any
amendment or waiver which would, but for this paragraph, require the consent of each Guarantor if the Class B
Guarantee under the Class B Finance Documents is to remain in full force and effect.

319


-----

For the purposes of any amendment, waiver, consent, modification or variation in respect of the Class B
Financial Covenant described above under “—Certain Covenants—Class B Financial Covenant”, the Class B5
Noteholders and the Class B6 Noteholders shall not be considered part of the relevant Class B Noteholders for the
purposes of the Class B Instructing Group in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**POST-CLOSING REORGANISATIONS**

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement also provides that a number of post-closing transactions will
be permitted (subject to certain conditions being satisfied), including:

**Longleat Headlease Transfer and grant of the New Longleat Opco Lease**

If CP Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that it intends to arrange the transfer either
directly or indirectly by means of a surrender and re-grant of the Longleat Headlease Interest from Longleat Propco
to a new property-holding Obligor (a “Longleat Headlease Transfer”) and the grant of the Opco Lease between that
new Obligor and CP Opco (the “New Longleat Opco Lease”) in each case with the consent of the landlord, then
provided that CP Opco certifies that the provisions relating thereto in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with,
the Borrower Security Trustee must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice but subject to
the second paragraph of this covenant, at the cost of the Borrowers, sign and execute all such documents, instruments
and consents (including Land Registry forms) as are necessary or desirable in order to enable the transfer of the
Longleat Headlease Interest and the grant of the New Longleat Opco Lease as aforesaid.

In connection with the Longleat Headlease Transfer and the New Longleat Opco Lease, such new Obligor
must:

(i) execute and deliver in favour of the Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the
Borrower Secured Creditors a Longleat Legal Charge; and

(ii) provide the Borrower Security Trustee with a legal opinion (in a form satisfactory to the
Borrower Security Trustee) on the enforceability of the Longleat Legal Charge,

in each case, at the same time as any relevant release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee, and
provide, as soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of the Longleat Headlease Transfer, the Borrower
Security Trustee with a new certificate of title in industry standard form evidencing that that new Obligor is entitled
to be registered as the registered proprietor of the Longleat Headlease Interest and CP Opco is entitled to be registered
as the registered proprietor of the New Longleat Opco Lease, and the Borrower Security Trustee is entitled (but not
obliged) to be registered as the proprietor of the Longleat Legal Charge.

In connection with the grant of the New Longleat Opco Lease, CP Opco must execute and deliver in favour
of the Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the Borrower Secured Creditors a charge by way of legal mortgage
in respect of the New Longleat Opco Lease substantially in the form set out in the Borrower Deed of Charge at the
same time as any relevant release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee.

**Release of Designated Obligors**

If:

(i) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the Obligor Group
intends to wind up and ultimately dissolve some or all of the Designated Obligors; and

(ii) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the provisions
relating thereto as set out in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with,

then the Borrower Security Trustee must as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice, at the cost
of the Borrowers:

(A) release:

(I) all Liens granted by the relevant Designated Obligors under the
Borrower Security Documents; and

(II) all Liens granted in respect of any share capital of the relevant
Designated Obligors under the Borrower Security Documents; and

320


-----

(B) irrevocably release and discharge the relevant Designated Obligors from all
liabilities which they may have under the Class B Finance Documents.

The above provisions may be utilised on more than one occasion in connection with different Designated
Obligors.

**Capital reductions**

If CP Opco (on behalf of the Obligors) notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee in writing (and
with reasonable detail as to what is proposed) that an Obligor proposes to undertake any capital reduction procedures
then, subject to (b), (c) and (d) below, the Borrower Security Trustee must sign and/or execute such documents or
instruments and give such consents (if any) as are or may be necessary or desirable in the opinion of CP Opco (acting
reasonably) in order to implement the relevant capital reduction.

Any costs of the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee in respect of any such capital reduction must be
met by the Obligors.

CP Opco must first provide the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee with appropriate evidence (which
may be, if required in writing by the Borrower Security Trustee, an opinion issued by the professional tax advisor of
the Group) satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee (acting reasonably) that the proposed capital reduction will
not give rise to any adverse tax liability in the Obligors or the Issuer, subject to and in accordance with the terms of
the Tax Deed of Covenant.

The provisions of this covenant are without prejudice to the provisions of “— Certain Covenants — Class B
_Restricted Payments”._

The provisions of this covenant shall not apply on and after the Existing Class B Loans Discharge Date.

**Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisations**

If CP Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that, without prejudice to the Group’s
obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Obligor Group intends to enter into a transaction,
or a series of transactions, in connection with a sale of a Propco or a Propco’s interest in a Holiday Park (such
transaction or series of transactions, a “Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisation”) in each case with landlord consent
(where such consent is required), then the Borrower Security Trustee must as soon as reasonably practicable after the
receipt of such notice, at the cost of the Borrowers, provide all necessary consents, waivers and permissions (including
any release and simultaneous re-taking of security which may be required) which are necessary to enable such
Permitted Pre-Sale Reorganisation to take place, but only to the extent that:

(i) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the provisions
relating thereto as set out in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with; and

(ii) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that any such release is
not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the position of the Borrower
Secured Creditors.

The above provisions may be utilised on more than one occasion in connection with different Permitted PreSale Reorganisations.

**Permitted Post-Closing Reorganisations**

If CP Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that, without prejudice to the Group’s
obligations under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Group intends to enter into a transaction, or a
series of transactions, as part of the reorganisation of the Group as envisaged in Section 14 of the Permitted PostClosing Reorganisation Paper (a “Permitted Post-Closing Reorganisation”), then the Borrower Security Trustee
must as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice, at the cost of the Borrowers, provide all
necessary consents, waivers and permissions (including any release and simultaneous re-taking of security which may
be required) which are necessary to enable the Permitted Post-Closing Reorganisations to take place, but only to the
extent that:

(i) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that the provisions
relating thereto as set out in the Tax Deed of Covenant are complied with; and

321


-----

(ii) CP Opco certifies to the Borrower Security Trustee and the Issuer that any such release is
not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the position of the Borrower
Secured Creditors.

The above provisions may be utilised on more than one occasion in connection with different Permitted PostClosing Reorganisations.

**Woburn Headlease Transfer and grant of the Woburn Opco Lease**

If CP Woburn Opco notifies the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee that it intends to arrange the
assignment of the Woburn Headlease from CP Woburn Opco to a new property-holding Obligor (a “Woburn
**Headlease Transfer”) and/or the grant of an Opco Lease between that new Obligor or CP Woburn Opco, as the case**
may be, and CP Opco (the “Woburn Opco Lease”) in each case with the consent of the landlord, then provided that
CP Woburn Opco certifies that the provisions relating thereto in the First Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant are
complied with, the Borrower Security Trustee must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such notice
but subject to the paragraph below, at the cost of the Borrowers, sign and execute all such documents, instruments and
consents (including Land Registry forms) as are necessary or desirable in order to enable the transfer of the Woburn
Headlease and/or the grant of the Woburn Opco Lease as aforesaid. In connection with the Woburn Headlease Transfer
and/or the Woburn Opco Lease, such new Obligor must:

(i) execute and deliver in favour of the (i) Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the
Borrower Secured Creditors a mortgage over the relevant Property; and

(ii) provide the Borrower Security Trustee with a legal opinion (in a form satisfactory to the
Borrower Security Trustee) on the enforceability of that mortgage,

in each case, at the same time as any relevant release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee, and
provide, as soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of the Woburn Headlease Transfer, the Borrower
Security Trustee with a new certificate of title in industry standard form evidencing that that new Obligor is entitled
to be registered as the registered proprietor of the Woburn Headlease and CP Opco is entitled to be registered as the
registered proprietor of the Woburn Opco Lease, and the Borrower Security Trustee is entitled (but not obliged) to be
registered as the proprietor of the Woburn Legal Charge.

In connection with the grant of the Woburn Opco Lease, CP Opco must execute and deliver in favour of the
Borrower Security Trustee for the benefit of the Borrower Secured Creditors a charge by way of legal mortgage in
respect of the Woburn Opco Lease substantially in the form set out in the Borrower Deed of Charge at the same time
as any relevant release or consent is to be given by the Borrower Security Trustee.

**ADDITIONAL SITE COVENANTS**

**Costs and payments**

Notwithstanding anything in “— Certain Covenants — Class B Restricted Payments” to the contrary, any
Obligor may, in connection with any Additional Site, incur Relevant Costs (on behalf of an Additional Site Entity)
_provided that:_

(i) the Net Exposure Amount does not at any time exceed £1.0 million; and

(ii) the Long Term Net Exposure Amount does not at any time exceed £5.0 million, each such
amount to be indexed, upwards only, at the end of each financial year based on the CPI
applicable to that Financial Year.

For the purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant:

“Long Term Net Exposure Amount” means, at any time:

(i) the aggregate of Relevant Costs (x) which have been incurred and paid by the Obligors
under the first paragraph of this covenant which have been funded otherwise than by
utilisation of funds which at the time they have been paid by the Obligors have been able
to be distributed as Class B Restricted Payments and (y) which have been contracted to be
paid but are not yet payable by the Obligors; less

(ii) the aggregate of amounts reimbursed to the Obligors by the relevant Additional Site
Entities.

322


-----

“Net Exposure Amount” means, at any time:

(i) the aggregate of Relevant Costs incurred and paid by the Obligors under the first paragraph
of this covenant which have been funded otherwise than by utilisation of funds which at
the time they have been paid by the Obligors have been able to be distributed as Class B
Restricted Payments; less

(ii) the aggregate of amounts reimbursed to the Obligors by the relevant Additional Site
Entities.

“Relevant Costs” means costs:

(i) which relate only to services provided to or in respect of an Additional Site; and/or

(ii) which represent the proportion of costs incurred in respect of obligations to third parties
which are attributable to an Additional Site;

and which, in either case, are not costs relating to management, internal accounting
(including tax, but not external, audit), personnel, compliance support, supply
arrangements, health & safety, IT site maintenance services, concessionary arrangements,
customer services, legal and information technology, sales and/or marketing central costs
incurred by an Obligor in respect of the Center Parcs Group generally, a proportion of
which may be recharged to the relevant Additional Site Entity.

**Additional Obligors**

If a person who is not an original party to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, either following its
acquisition by an Obligor or through its incorporation, becomes a Subsidiary of Intermediate Holdco, it shall promptly
execute and deliver to the Borrower Security Trustee an Accession Deed (together with any supporting documentation
referred to in that Accession Deed) and, upon such execution and delivery, such person shall be bound by the
provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement as if the terms set out in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement were incorporated in full into the arrangements made between that person and the Borrower Secured
Creditors.

In the event that the accession of any person to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement requires the
Borrower Security Trustee, the Issuer Security Trustee, the Cash Manager, the Class B Registrar, the Class B Transfer
Agent, the Borrower Account Bank, the Issuer Account Bank or the Principal Paying Agent to comply with “know
your customer” or other similar identification procedures and in such circumstances where the necessary information
is not already available to it, the Obligor Group Agent shall promptly upon the request of the Borrower Security
Trustee supply, or procure the supply of, such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the
Borrower Security Trustee in order for it to carry out and be satisfied that it has complied with all the necessary “know
your customer” or similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to any relevant person pursuant
to the accession of such person to the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement as an Additional Obligor or Additional
Non-Obligor Group Entity and such person shall not become an Additional Obligor or Additional Non-Obligor Group
Entity until the Borrower Security Trustee has completed its “know your customer” or similar checks.

Each party acknowledges that such Accession Deed shall, if so requested by the Borrower Security Trustee
or the Issuer, be accompanied by: (i) legal tax and accounting opinions, addressed to the Borrower Security Trustee
and the Issuer, and in a form satisfactory to the Borrower Security Trustee; (ii) any documentation required to accede
to the Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Borrower Deed of Charge (if relevant); and (iii) a certificate signed by the
Borrowers confirming that no Share Enforcement Event, Class B Loan Default or Class B Loan Event of Default is
outstanding.

Such Obligor shall accede to the Original Tax Deed of Covenant in accordance with clause 2.8 of the Original
Tax Deed of Covenant, to the First Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant in accordance with Clause 8 of the First
Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant, to the Second Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant in accordance with Clause
7 of the Second Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant, to the Third Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant in accordance
with Clause 7 of the Third Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant, to the Fourth Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant
in accordance with Clause 7 of the Fourth Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant and to the Fifth Supplemental Tax
Deed of Covenant in accordance with Clause 7 of the Fifth Supplemental Tax Deed of Covenant.

323


-----

**Resignation of Obligors**

Any Borrower may request that a non-Material Obligor ceases to be an Obligor under the terms of the Class
B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement by giving to the Issuer and the Borrower Security Trustee a duly completed
Obligor Resignation Request.

The Borrower Security Trustee must accept an Obligor Resignation Request (in substantially the same form
as provided in the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement) and notify the Borrowers and the Issuer of its acceptance
if the conditions referred to in the Obligor Resignation Request are satisfied. The relevant Obligor will cease to be an
Obligor when the Borrower Security Trustee gives the notification.

**CLASS A DISCHARGE DATE**

The Obligors will not permit the Class A Discharge Date to occur unless the Issuer has received a Rating
Agency Confirmation in respect of the Class B Notes from S&P with respect thereto.

**CLASS A COVENANTS**

From the date on which a Share Enforcement Event also constitutes a Class B Loan Event of Default, the
general and property covenants set out in the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (the “Class A Covenants”)
shall be deemed to be incorporated into the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement mutatis mutandis as further
described below, until such time as the Issuer receives a Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P in relation to the
disapplication of the Class A Covenants.

Where the Class A Covenants are incorporated into the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement as
described above:

(a) capitalised terms used in the Class A Covenants shall have the same meaning and construction as
incorporated into the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, subject to paragraphs (b) to (e)
below;

(b) references to “Class A Loans”, “Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement”, “Class A IBLA” and
“Class A Notes” shall be deemed to be references to “Class B Loans”, “Class B Issuer/Borrower
Loan Agreement”, “Class B IBLA” and “Class B Notes”, respectively;

(c) references to a “Class A Loan Event of Default” and “Class A Loan Potential Event of Default”
shall be deemed to be references to a “Class B Loan Event of Default” and a “Class B Loan Default”
respectively;

(d) where a Class A Covenant (or a defined term referred to in a Class A Covenant) refers to both “Class
A” and “Class B”, the references to “Class B” shall be deemed to be deleted and the references to
“Class A” shall be deemed to be references to “Class B”;

(e) the Borrower Security Trustee shall have the power to enforce the Class A Covenants on behalf of
the Issuer and (indirectly) the Class B Noteholders as if the Class B Loan constituted a Class A Loan
on the terms of the Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement may be amended by the parties thereto in accordance with the
Class A Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement from time to time without the consent of
the Class B Noteholders. To the extent any Class A Covenants are amended following the Seventh Closing Date, the
Class A Covenants incorporated into the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement in the manner described above,
shall be the Class A Covenants as amended, restated or supplemented on the date of such incorporation into the Class
B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

If the Class A Covenants are amended following the Seventh Closing Date, the CP Opco shall notify the
Issuer and the Class B Note Trustee of such amendments, and the Issuer shall give notice to the Class B Noteholders
in the manner set out in the Class B Conditions.

**RELEASE OF LIENS**

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, liens on the Collateral securing the obligations under the Class B
Finance Documents (or if other Borrower Secured Liabilities remain outstanding, all claims of the Issuer in respect of

324


-----

those Liens to the extent of its claims under the Class B Finance Documents) will be automatically and unconditionally
released:

(a) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on each Class B Loan under the
Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement or discharge thereof;

(b) upon release of a Guarantee in accordance with the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (with
respect to the Liens securing the assets, property and Capital Stock of the Guarantor that is released
from such Guarantee);

(c) in connection with any disposition of Collateral to any Person other than Topco or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (but excluding any transaction subject to the provisions described under “—
_Certain Covenants — Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” that is permitted by the Class B_
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (with respect to the Liens on such Collateral));

(d) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property
or assets to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) Topco or any
Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition that is not prohibited by, or does not otherwise
violate the provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement relating to asset sales;

(e) if Topco designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement;

(f) as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(g) otherwise permitted under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement.

The Borrower Security Trustee will, subject to its receipt of an Officer’s certificate or opinion of counsel or
other documentation reasonably requested, take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral
securing the obligations under the Class B Finance Documents in accordance with the provisions of the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
relevant Borrower Security Documents. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Borrower Security
Trustee without the consent of the Issuer.

**DEFEASANCE**

The Borrowers may at any time terminate all obligations of the Borrowers and the Guarantors under the Class
B Loans and the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Share
Enforcement Events and Class B Loan Event of Defaults, except for certain obligations, including those respecting
the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Borrower Security Trustee
and the obligations of the Borrowers in connection therewith. Subject to the foregoing, if the Borrowers exercise their
legal defeasance option, the Class B Finance Document and the rights of the Borrower Security Trustee and the Class
B Noteholders under the Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the
defeasance trust) in so far as they apply to the Class B Loans, the Class B Notes and the Class B Noteholders.

The Borrowers at any time may terminate their and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described
under “— _Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (i) and (ii) of the first paragraph of “—_ _Certain Covenants_ —
_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”) and “— Change B Change of Control” and the default provisions relating_
to such covenants described under “— Share Enforcement Event And Class B Loan Event Of Default”, the operation
of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect
to the Borrowers and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security
default provision described under “— _Share Enforcement Event And Class B Loan Event Of Default_ — _Share_
_Enforcement Event” (“covenant defeasance”)._

The Borrowers at their option at any time may exercise their legal defeasance option notwithstanding their
prior exercise of the covenant defeasance option. If the Borrowers exercises their legal defeasance option, payment of
the Class B Loans may not be accelerated because of a Share Enforcement Event or Class B Loan Event of Default
with respect to such Class B Loans and the occurrence of a Share Enforcement Event would not give the right to
enforce the Topco Payment Undertakings and Topco Security. If the Borrowers exercise their covenant defeasance
option with respect to the Class B Loans, payment of the Class B Loans may not be accelerated because of a Share
Enforcement Event specified in clauses (vi) (other than with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) of the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “— _Certain Covenants_ — _Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”), (vii), (viii) (with_

325


-----

respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (x), (xi) or (xii) under the first paragraph of “— Share Enforcement Event
_And Class B Loan Event Of Default — Share Enforcement Event”._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Borrowers must irrevocably deposit in trust by way of
security (the “defeasance trust”) with the Borrower Security Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as
agent by the Borrower Security Trustee for this purpose) cash in Sterling in an amount sufficient for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest, the applicable Class B Loan Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon on the relevant Class B Loans to maturity and must comply with certain other
conditions, including delivery to the Borrower Security Trustee of:

(a) an opinion of U.S. counsel to the effect that the lenders of the relevant Class B Loans will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such opinion of U.S. counsel must be based on
a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax
law);

(b) an Officer’s Certificate of each Borrower stating that the deposit was not made by the Borrowers
with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the
Borrowers;

(c) an Officer’s Certificate of each Borrower and an opinion of counsel (which opinion of counsel may
be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent
provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been
complied with;

(d) an opinion of U.S. counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute,
or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended; and

(e) all other documents or other information that the Borrower Security Trustee may reasonably require
in connection with either defeasance option.

**SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE**

The Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement, and the rights of the Borrower Security Trustee, the Issuer
and the Class B Noteholders under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Borrower Security Documents, will be
discharged and cease to be of further effect with respect to all outstanding Class B6 Loans when (1) (i) all of the Class
B6 Loans have become due and payable or (ii) all of the Class B6 Loans will become due and payable at the Class B6
Loan Expected Maturity Date or the Class B6 Loan Final Maturity Date, in each case within one year or (iii) all of the
Class B6 Loans are to be called for prepayment within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the
Borrower Security Trustee for the giving of notice of prepayment by the Borrowers; (2) the Borrowers have deposited
or caused to be deposited with the Borrower Security Trustee (or another entity designated by the Borrower Security
Trustee for this purpose), an amount in Sterling sufficient to pay and discharge the entire outstanding principal amount
on the Class B6 Loans, together with any prepayment premium, if any, accrued and unpaid interest, the Class B6 Loan
Deferred Interest Amounts, if any, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, to the date of deposit (in the case of
Class B6 Loans that have become due and payable), or to the Class B6 Loan Final Maturity Date, or prepayment date,
as the case may be; (3) the Borrowers have paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Class B
Issuer/Borrower Loan Agreement with respect to the Class B6 Loans; (4) the Borrowers have delivered an irrevocable
notice of prepayment to the Borrower Security Trustee and have delivered irrevocable instructions to apply the funds
deposited towards the payment of the Class B6 Loans on the prepayment date; and (5) the Borrowers have delivered
to the Borrower Security Trustee an Officer’s Certificate of each Borrower (which the Borrower Security Trustee may
rely on without further inquiry) to the effect that all conditions precedent under the Class B Issuer/Borrower Loan
Agreement relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Class B6 Loans have been complied with.

**NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of Topco or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Topco, the Issuer or any Guarantor
under the Class B Finance Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or

326


-----

their creation. Each Class B Noteholder by accepting a Class B Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver
and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Class B Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public
policy.

**GOVERNING LAW**

mergers, consolidations and disposed operations that have been made by Topco or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior

_forma_ basis (including anticipated synergies and expenses and cost savings) assuming that all such
Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, consolidations and disposed or discontinued operations (and
the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had
occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person
that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into Topco or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition,
merger, consolidation or disposed or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant

for such period (including anticipated synergies and expenses and cost savings) as if such Investment,
acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period. Any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Fixed Charge Coverage

bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Financial Indebtedness
shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the
applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Financial
Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalised Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate
reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of Topco to be the rate of interest
implicit in such Capitalised Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. For the purposes of making the
computation referred to above, interest on any Financial Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility
computed with a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Financial
Indebtedness during the applicable period, except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest
on Financial Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime
or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based
upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as Topco may designate.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Offered Notes sold to persons who are not U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation
S will be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Global Note”). The
Global Note will be deposited on the Seventh Closing Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of
the nominee of the common depositary for the account of Euroclear and Clearstream (each, a “Clearing System”).

Ownership of interests in the Global Note (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through such participants.

Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Note on behalf of their respective participants
through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except
under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive certificated
form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of
such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or
pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Offered Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests
will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Offered Notes for any purpose.

By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Global Note, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to represent,
among other things, that it is not a U.S. person, that it is located outside the United States and that, if it determines to
transfer such beneficial interest prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period (as such terms are defined
in Rules 902 and 903 of Regulation S), deemed to include the 40-day period after the commencement of the offering
of the Offered Notes or the Sixth Closing Date, whichever is later (the “distribution compliance period”), it will
transfer such interest only to a person who is not a U.S. person in an offshore transaction in accordance with Rule 903
or Rule 904 of Regulation S, in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United
States. See “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions”.

So long as the Offered Notes are held in global form, the common depositories for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable (or their respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Note for
all purposes under the Note Trust Deed governing the Offered Notes. In addition, participants must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear,
Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise
any rights of holders of Offered Notes under the Note Trust Deed.

By acquiring an Offered Note (or any interest therein), each purchaser and transferee is deemed to represent,
warrant and agree, for so long as it holds such Offered Note (or any interest therein), that (a) either (1) it is not, and is
not acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan that is subject to any
Similar Law or (2) its acquisition, holding and disposition of the Offered Note (or any interest therein) will not
constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
or a violation of any Similar Law, and (b) it will not sell or otherwise transfer the Offered Note (or any interest therein)
to any transferee that is a Benefit Plan Investor or any person acting on behalf of a Benefit Plan Investor.

None of the Issuer, the Paying Agents, the Class B Registrar, the Class B Transfer Agent or the Class B Note
Trustee will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Note**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received
by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the
redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). Center Parcs understands
that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all the Offered Notes are to be redeemed

LON61101112/31 166017 0009 362


-----

at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no
Book-Entry Interest of £100,000 principal amount or less may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Note**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures. The
Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or
future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and
as described under the captions “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes — Taxes — Additional Amounts” in
Annex A hereto. If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under the
captions “Terms and Conditions of the Class B Notes — Taxes — Additional Amounts” in Annex A hereto, as
applicable, the Issuer will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any
holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net
amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry
Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held
through such participants.

Each payment in respect of any Global Note will be made to the person shown as the holder of a Global Note
at the close of business on the Clearing System Business Day (the “Global Note Record Date”) immediately prior to
the due date for payment where “Clearing System Business Day” means a day on which each Clearing System for
which the Global Note is being held is open for business.

Under the terms of the Note Trust Deed, the Issuer, the Class B Note Trustee, the Class B Registrar, the Class
B Transfer Agent and the relevant Paying Agent, will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (e.g. Euroclear
or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all
other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Class B Note Trustee, the Class B Registrar, the Class B Transfer
Agent or any of their respective Paying Agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for (1) any aspect of the
records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account
of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, (2) Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant or (3) the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Note**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Note will be paid to the holders of interests in such Offered Notes in pounds sterling.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of Offered Notes (including the presentation of Offered Notes for exchange as described herein) only at the
direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests are credited and only in respect of
such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Offered Notes as to which such participant or participants has or
have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Note. However, if there is an event of default under
the Note Trust Deed, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right, at the request of the holders of the Offered
Notes, to exchange the Global Note for definitive registered notes in certificated form (“Definitive Notes”) and to
distribute Definitive Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear
and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of
Definitive Notes for any reason, including to sell Offered Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require physical

363


-----

delivery of securities or to pledge such Offered Notes, such holder must transfer its interests in the Global Note in
accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set out
in the Note Trust Deed.

Each Global Note will have a legend to the effect set out under “Notice to Investors and Transfer
_Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification_
requirements discussed under “Notice to Investors and Transfer Restrictions.” Transfers of Book-Entry Interests will
at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Any Book-Entry Interest in a Global Note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first
mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter
be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other
Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Notes**

Under the terms of the Note Trust Deed, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Notes if:

    - the Issuer has been notified that Euroclear or Clearstream have been closed for business for a
continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, whether statutory or otherwise) or
have announced an intention permanently to cease business or have in fact done so and, in any such
case, no successor clearing system satisfactory to the Class B Note Trustee is available; or

    - the Issuer has or will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would not be suffered were
the Offered Note represented by the Global Note in definitive form.

In such an event, the Class B Registrar will issue Definitive Notes, registered in the name or names and issued
in denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, requested by or on behalf of
Euroclear, Clearstream or the Issuer (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive
Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Note Trust Deed, unless that legend is not required by such
Note Trust Deed or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Class B Note Trustee, the Class B Transfer Agent, any Paying
Agent and the Class B Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute
owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes
will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is
a means of evidencing title to the Offered Notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Offered Notes; however, owners of the
Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. Center Parcs provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement
system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners,
the Paying Agents, the Class B Transfer Agent or the Class B Registrar is responsible for those operations or
procedures.

Center Parcs understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream
hold securities for participating organisations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions
between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear
and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance,
settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with
domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters,
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear and

364


-----

Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who, in turn, act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons
or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such
interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require
that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer
beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Offered Notes represented by the Global Note are expected to be listed and admitted for trading on the
Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Note between participants in Euroclear and
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers
of interests in the Global Note among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified
at any time. None of the Issuer, the Obligors, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners, the Class B
Note Trustee or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or
their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Offered Notes will be made in pounds sterling. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional notes in registered
form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders
on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in sameday funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any
Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be
made on the desired value date.

365

**TAXATION**

_If you are a prospective investor, you should consult your tax advisor on the possible tax consequences of_
_buying, holding or selling the Offered Notes under the laws of your country of citizenship, residence or domicile,_
_including the effect of any local taxes applicable to you. The discussions that follow do not purport to be a_
_comprehensive description of all tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or sell the_
_Offered Notes. In particular, these discussions do not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to_
_you. The discussions that follow for each jurisdiction are based upon the applicable laws and interpretations thereof_
_as in effect as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. These tax laws and interpretations are subject to change,_
_possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect._

**United Kingdom Taxation**

The following applies only to persons who are the beneficial owners of the Offered Notes and is a summary
of the Issuer’s understanding of current United Kingdom law and HMRC published practice in the United Kingdom
relating only to United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments of interest on the Offered Notes. The
following is not exhaustive and does not deal with any other United Kingdom taxation implications of acquiring,
holding or disposing of the Offered Notes. The United Kingdom tax treatment of prospective Noteholders depends on
their individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. Prospective Noteholders who may be subject
to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom or who may be unsure as to their tax position should seek their
own professional advice.

**_Payment of Interest on the Offered Notes_**

Payments of interest on the Offered Notes may be made without deduction of or withholding on account of
United Kingdom income tax provided that the Offered Notes are and continue to be listed on a “recognised stock
exchange” within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The International Stock Exchange is a
recognised stock exchange. The Offered Notes will satisfy this requirement if they are officially listed in Guernsey in
accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in EEA states and are admitted to trading on
the International Stock Exchange. Provided, therefore, that the Offered Notes are and remain so listed, interest on the
Offered Notes will be payable without withholding or deduction on account of United Kingdom tax.

In other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Offered Notes that
have a UK source on account of United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), subject to any available
exemptions and reliefs. However, where an applicable double tax treaty provides for a lower rate of withholding tax
(or for no tax to be withheld) in relation to a Noteholder, HMRC can issue a notice to the Issuer to pay interest to the
Noteholder without deduction of tax (or for the interest to be paid with tax deducted at the rate provided for in the
relevant double tax treaty).

The references to “interest” in this United Kingdom Taxation section means “interest” as that term is
understood for United Kingdom tax purposes, and in particular any premium element of the redemption amount of
any Notes redeemable at a premium may constitute a payment of interest subject to the withholding tax provisions
discussed above. In certain cases, the same could be true for amounts of discount where Notes are issued at a discount.
The statements above do not take any account of any different definitions of “interest” or “principal” which may
prevail under any other law or which may be created by the terms and conditions of the Notes or any related
documentation.

**Certain Jersey taxation considerations**

The following summary of the anticipated treatment of the Issuer and holders of the Offered Notes (other
than residents of Jersey) is based on Jersey taxation law and practice as they are understood to apply at the date of this
document and is subject to changes in such taxation law and practice. It does not constitute legal or tax advice and
does not address all aspects of Jersey tax law and practice. Prospective investors in the Offered Notes should consult
their professional advisers on the implications of acquiring, buying, selling or otherwise disposing of the Offered
Notes under the laws of any jurisdiction in which they may be liable to taxation.

**_Taxation of the Issuer_**

The Issuer is not regarded as resident for tax purposes in Jersey. Therefore, the Issuer will not be liable to
Jersey income tax other than on Jersey source income (except where such income is exempted from income tax
pursuant to the Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961, as amended) and payments in respect of the Offered Notes may be

366


-----

paid by the Issuer without withholding or deduction for or on account of Jersey income tax. The holders of the Offered
Notes (other than residents of Jersey) will not be subject to any tax in Jersey in respect of the holding, sale or other
disposition of such Offered Notes.

**_Stamp Duty_**

In Jersey, no stamp duty is levied on the issue or transfer of the Offered Notes except that stamp duty is
payable on Jersey grants of probate and letters of administration, which will generally be required to transfer the
Offered Notes on the death of a holder of such Offered Notes where such Offered Notes are situated in Jersey. In the
case of a grant of probate or letters of administration, stamp duty is levied according to the size of the estate (wherever
situated in respect of a holder of Offered Notes domiciled in Jersey, or situated in Jersey in respect of a holder of
Offered Notes domiciled outside Jersey) and is payable on a sliding scale at a rate of up to 0.75% of such estate and
such duty is capped at £100,000. Where the Offered Notes are in registered form and the register is not maintained in
Jersey such Offered Notes should not be considered to be situated in Jersey for these purposes.

Jersey does not otherwise levy taxes upon capital, inheritances, capital gains or gifts nor are there other estate
duties.

**The proposed financial transaction tax**

On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for
a Directive for a common financial transaction tax (“FTT”) in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France,
Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (each, other than Estonia, a “participating Member State”). However,
Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the
Offered Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Primary market transactions
referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 are expected to be exempt.

Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and
outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Offered Notes where
at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A
financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member State in a broad range of
circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the
financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States. It may
therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States
may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of the Offered Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the
FTT.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of Offered
Notes by (i) “employee benefit plans” that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), (ii) “plans” (including individual retirement accounts) as defined in and subject to
Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”), (iii) entities whose underlying assets
include the assets of any such employee benefit plan subject to ERISA or other plan subject to Section 4975 of the
Code, and (iv) governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section
3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA)) that, while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, may be subject to other federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations that are
substantially similar to the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Law”) (each
of (i)-(iv), a “Plan”). This summary is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity
of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it
is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Offered Notes on behalf of, or
with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their own counsel to determine whether such acquisition, holding and
subsequent disposition will violate Title I of ERISA, Section 406 of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or any Similar
Law.

**General Fiduciary Considerations**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any
discretionary authority or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the
assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, to an
ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

When considering an investment in the Offered Notes with the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Law relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including,
without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of Section
406 of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Law.

**Prohibited Transaction Considerations**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of Section
3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or
administrative exemption or exception is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who
engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under
ERISA and the Code.

The acquisition or holding of the Offered Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, Center
Parcs or any of their respective affiliates are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or
result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code,
unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory or administrative exemption
or exception. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor (the “DOL”) has issued prohibited transaction class
exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Offered Notes. These exemptions include,
without limitation, PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating
to transactions effected by an “independent qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 95-60 (relating to
investments by an insurance company general account), PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house
asset manager) and PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts). In addition,
Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code could provide relief from the prohibited transaction
provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan
and non-fiduciary service providers to the ERISA Plan; provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its
affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice
with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan
pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that any of

368


-----

the PTCEs or any other exemption or exception will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving
the Offered Notes, or that, if any of the PTCEs or another exemption or exception is available, it will cover all aspects
of any particular transaction. Prospective investors should consult with their advisors regarding the prohibited
transaction rules and these exemptions.

Because of the foregoing, the Offered Notes (and interests therein) should not be acquired, held or disposed
of by any Plan or any person acting on behalf of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and disposition would not
constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
or a violation of any Similar Law. Any purported purchase, transfer or holding in violation of these limitations will be
void. If such purchase or transfer is not treated as being void for any reason, the Offered Notes will automatically be
transferred to a charitable trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and the Plan will acquire no right in the
Offered Notes.

**Plan Asset Considerations**

Regulations promulgated under ERISA by the DOL at 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section
3(42) of ERISA (together, the “Plan Asset Regulations”), provide that when an ERISA Plan acquires an “equity
interest” in an entity that is neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act, the ERISA Plan’s assets include both the equity interest and an
undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of the entity unless it is established either that equity participation
in the entity by “benefit plan investors” is not “significant” or that the entity is an “operating company,” in each case
as defined in the Plan Asset Regulations. For purposes of the Plan Asset Regulations, equity participation in an entity
by benefit plan investors will not be significant if benefit plan investors hold, in the aggregate, less than 25% of the
total value of each class of equity interests of such entity, excluding equity interests held by any person (other than a
benefit plan investor) who has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the entity or who provides
investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets, and any “affiliates” (as defined in the Plan
Asset Regulations) of such person. For purposes of this 25% test, “benefit plan investors” include ERISA Plans and
any entity whose underlying assets include, or are deemed for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code to
include, “plan assets” by reason of an ERISA Plan’s investment in the entity (“Benefit Plan Investors”) under the
Plan Asset Regulations, but exclude governmental, church and non-U.S. plans.

While the discussion under “Taxation” assumes that the Offered Notes will be treated as debt for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, such characterisation is not entirely clear, and no assurances can be given that the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) would not assert, or that a court would not uphold, a different characterisation of the Offered
Notes. In addition, it is anticipated that (i) the Offered Notes will not constitute “publicly offered securities” for
purposes of the Plan Asset Regulations and (ii) the Issuer will not be an investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act.

If the Issuer’s assets were deemed to be “plan assets” of an ERISA Plan holding the Offered Notes, this
would result in, among other things, (i) the application of the prudence and other fiduciary responsibility standards of
ERISA to investments made by the Issuer, and (ii) the possibility that certain transactions that the Issuer might enter
into, or may have entered into, in the ordinary course of business might constitute or result in non-exempt prohibited
transactions under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code and might have to be rescinded.

**Representations**

Accordingly, each purchaser and holder of the Offered Notes (or any interest therein) will be deemed to have
represented, warranted and agreed, for so long as it holds such Offered Notes (or any interest therein), that (A) either
(i) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan that is
subject to any Similar Law, or (ii) its acquisition, holding and disposition of the Offered Notes (or any interest therein)
will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code or a violation of any Similar Law, and (B) it will not sell or otherwise transfer the Offered Notes (or any
interest therein) to any transferee that is a Benefit Plan Investor or any person acting on behalf of a Benefit Plan
Investor.

Any purported purchase, transfer, holding or disposition in violation of these representations will be void. If
such purchase, transfer, holding or disposition is not treated as being void for any reason, the Offered Notes will

automatically be transferred to a charitable trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and the purported holder
will acquire no right in the Offered Notes.

Each purchaser and holder of the Offered Notes (or any interest therein) that is, or is acting on behalf of, a
Benefit Plan Investor, will be further deemed to have represented, warranted and agreed that (i) none of the Issuer,
Center Parcs or other persons that provide marketing services, or any of their respective affiliates, has provided any
investment recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of
the Benefit Plan Investor (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied as a primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in
the Offered Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA
or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the Benefit Plan Investor or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the Benefit
Plan Investor’s acquisition of the Offered Notes, and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment
in evaluating the investment in the Offered Notes.

**LIMITATION ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the security interests_
_in each of the jurisdictions in which collateral is being provided. It is a summary only and does not purport to be_
_complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity or enforceability of the_
_obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor. The laws of more than one jurisdiction could potentially apply in respect_
_of certain matters which could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect_
_your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Offered Notes and the security interests on_
_the collateral. Prospective investors in the Offered Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to all_
_such limitations and considerations._

_In the event that the Issuer, any Guarantor or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is_
_not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be_
_commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the_
_obligations of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the collateral provided by any other company. The insolvency,_
_administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organised or operate may be_
_materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the_
_potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another._

**Jersey Insolvency**

The Issuer and one of the Obligors is incorporated under the laws of Jersey. In the event of an insolvency of
the Issuer or the Jersey Obligor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There are two principal regimes
for corporate insolvency in Jersey: désastre and winding up (including just and equitable winding up and creditors’
winding up). The principal type of insolvency procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the application for
an Act of the Royal Court of Jersey under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the “Jersey
**Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the property of a debtor to be “en désastre” (a “declaration”). On a declaration of**
_désastre, title and possession of the property of the debtor vest automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal_
Court (the “Viscount”). With effect from the date of declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against the property
or person of the debtor, and may not commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court,
continue any legal proceedings to recover the debt.

Additionally, the shareholders of a Jersey company (but not its creditors) can instigate a winding up of an
insolvent company, which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of the Companies
(Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Jersey Companies Law”). On a creditors’ winding up, a liquidator is nominated,
usually by the shareholders. The creditors may approve such a liquidator or apply to appoint a different liquidator.
The liquidator will stand in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding up, gather assets, make appropriate
disposals of assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate. After the commencement of the winding up, no
action can be taken or continued against the company except with the leave of court. The shareholders must however
give creditors 14 days’ notice of the meeting to commence the creditors’ winding up. The corporate state and capacity
of the company continues until the end of the winding up procedure, when the company is dissolved. The Jersey
Companies Law requires a creditor of a company (subject to appeal) to be bound by an arrangement entered into by
the company and its creditors immediately before or in the course of its winding up if, inter alia, three quarters in
number and value of the creditors acceded to the arrangement.

**_Compromises and arrangements with creditors_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, under Article 125 of the Jersey Companies Law the Royal Court may sanction
a compromise or arrangement (a "scheme of arrangement") between a Jersey company and its creditors or
shareholders (or a class of either of them). The Royal Court may, on application of the company (or a creditor or
shareholder or, if the company is being wound up, a liquidator) order a meeting to be called at which the proposed
scheme of arrangement must be agreed to by a majority in number representing:

    - 75% in value of the creditors (or class of creditors); or

    - 75% of the voting rights of the shareholders (or class of shareholders),

as the case may be, present and voting either in person or by proxy before the Royal Court considers the sanction of
the scheme of arrangement. If the requisite majority of creditors or shareholders (or of the relevant class of either of
them) agree to the scheme of arrangement and, following such agreement, the Royal Court sanctions the scheme of

371


-----

arrangement, the scheme of arrangement is binding on all creditors or shareholders (or on the relevant class of either
of them) and on the company (or any liquidator and contributories of the company if the company is being wound up).

**_Transactions at an Undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court may,
on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”) or
liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up, a procedure which is instigated by shareholders not creditors), set
aside a transaction (including any guarantee or security interest) entered into by a company with any person (the “other
party”) at an undervalue. There is a five-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or
declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant
time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without
limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction at an undervalue, the operation of the relevant time and the
effect of entering into such a transaction with a person connected with the company or with an associate of the
company.

**_Preference_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law, the court
may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”)
or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a preference (including any guarantee or security
interest) given by the company to any person (the “other party”). There is a 12-month look-back period from the date
of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to
examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law
contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a preference, the operation
of the relevant time and the effect of entering into a preference with a person connected with the company or with an
associate of the company.

**_Extortionate Credit Transactions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court
may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”)
or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction providing credit to the debtor company
which is or was extortionate. There is a three-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding
up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule. The
Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those
that define what constitutes a transaction which is extortionate.

**_Disclaimer of Onerous Property_**

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the date of
the declaration of désastre and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may within six months
following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous property of the company. “Onerous
property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract lease or other immoveable property if it is situated
outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it might give rise to a liability to pay money
or perform any other onerous act, and includes an unprofitable contract.

A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the “rights, interests and liabilities of the
company/debtor in or in respect of the property disclaimed” and discharges the company/Viscount from all liability
in respect of the property as of the date of the commencement of the creditors’ winding up/from the date of the
declaration but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company/debtor from liability,
affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of a disclaimer is
deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and shall have standing as a creditor in the
_désastre or creditors’ winding up. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions,_
including (without limitation) in relation to the power to disclaim onerous property.

**_Fraudulent Dispositions_**

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey
customary law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention of defeating
creditors’ claims may be set aside.

372


-----

**_Security Over Non Jersey Situs Assets_**

Under the laws of Jersey, a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey is deemed to have capacity
to grant security governed by foreign law over property situated outside Jersey, but to the extent that any floating
charge or other security interest governed by a foreign law is expressed to apply to any asset, property and undertaking
of a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey such floating charge or other security interest is not likely to
be held valid and enforceable by the Courts of Jersey in respect of Jersey situs assets.

**_Administrators, Receivers and Statutory and Non-statutory Requests for Assistance_**

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the
Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators are not part
of the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Courts of Jersey may not recognise the powers of an administrator,
administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets (although see below in the case of
fixed charge receivers).

However, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Jersey court may assist the courts of
prescribed countries and territories and, applying general principles of comity, assist the courts in other jurisdictions,
in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Jersey court thinks fit. These prescribed
jurisdictions include the United Kingdom. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL
model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey.

If the request comes from a non-prescribed country, then common law and principles of comity will be
considered by the Royal Court by virtue of its inherent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings have been commenced
in another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to
depend on the nature of the requesting country’s insolvency regime.

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should not be assumed that the
UNCITRAL provisions will automatically be followed. That is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. It would
also be wrong to assume for European countries that the position will be in accordance with EU Insolvency Regulation.
Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the purposes of implementation of its directions.
Accordingly, the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and the automatic test
of centre of main interests does not apply as a result.

**_Enforcement of Security and Security in Insolvency_**

Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, re-organisation or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the
rights of creditors, and laws in relation to transactions at undervalue, preference, extortionate credit transactions,
disclaimer of onerous property and fraudulent dispositions also apply in Jersey. Insolvency or bankruptcy alone will
not render such security interest invalid or non-binding on the parties thereto or any liquidator of a Jersey company or
the Viscount in a désastre of a Jersey company’s property. This is subject to certain statutory exceptions, which include
(but are not limited to):

    - Article 159(4) of the Jersey Companies Law provides that after the commencement of a creditors’
winding up of a Jersey company no action shall be taken or proceeded with against the company
except by leave of the court and subject to such terms as that court may impose; and

    - Article 10(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law provides that with effect from the date of a declaration
of désastre against a person (the “bankrupt”), a creditor shall not have any other remedy against the
property or person of the bankrupt or commence or (except with the consent of the Viscount or by
order of the court) continue any action or legal proceedings to recover such creditor’s debt; and

    - Generally a transfer of shares in a Jersey company, not being a transfer made to or with the sanction
of the liquidator of the company in a creditors’ winding up (insolvent winding up) under the Jersey
Companies Law, or the Viscount after the property of the company is declared to be en désastre
under the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, and an alteration in the status of the company’s members made
after the commencement of the creditors’ winding up or after such declaration of en désastre, is
void.

373


-----

In the enforcement of foreign security in Jersey, the Courts of Jersey — properly applying the relevant
provisions of foreign law — are likely to uphold (subject to the comments above) a claim that the relevant security
interest (and other than in respect of any property or assets situated or deemed to be situated in Jersey) is binding on
a Jersey company and any liquidator or other similar person having control of the assets of a Jersey company.

**Cayman Islands Insolvency**

The Topco Obligors are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Accordingly, any insolvency
proceedings with respect to the Topco Obligors are likely to be pursuant to the Companies Act and the Companies
Winding Up Rules, 2018 of the Cayman Islands. Under Cayman Islands law, insolvency proceedings involve the
appointment of a liquidator whose function it is to act as the agent of the company in order to: (i) realise the company’s
assets; (ii) identify the company’s creditors and the amounts of their claims; and (iii) distribute the proceeds of
realisation of the company’s assets (net of expenses and claims of secured and/or preferred creditors) to the company’s
unsecured creditors pro rata and, after the creditors have been paid in full, to distribute the remaining balance (if any)
to the company’s shareholders. Cayman Islands legislation provides for three different procedural systems for winding
up companies, namely: (i) compulsory winding up by order of the Court; (ii) voluntary winding up initiated by, for
example, a resolution of the shareholders or in accordance with the provisions of the company’s articles of association;
and (iii) voluntary winding up originally initiated by, for example, a resolution of the shareholders that is subsequently
made subject to the supervision of the Court. A winding up petition may be presented to the Court by the company
itself or a creditor (including a contingent or prospective creditor) or a shareholder of the company. A winding up
order is usually sought on the basis that the company is unable to pay its debts, or because it is otherwise just and
equitable to make a winding up order. When considering the inability of the company to pay debts, Cayman Islands
law requires that the Court have regard to the company’s cash-flow position. When a winding up order is made by the
Court, an automatic moratorium on proceedings against the company is imposed and proceedings may not be
commenced or continued against the company except with the express permission of the Court. Following the making
of a winding up order, dispositions of property, transfers of shares and alterations in the status of shareholders made
after the presentation of the petition for winding up are void unless approved by the Court. The moratorium does not
affect any valid contractual rights of set-off or subordination agreements acquired or entered into before the
commencement of the liquidation. A secured creditor is entitled to enforce his security without the leave of the Court
and without reference to the liquidator.

It is a fundamental rule of Cayman Islands insolvency law that all ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated
creditors are treated equally irrespective of the nature of their claims. This is referred to as the pari passu rule. Local
creditors (save in certain cases for a minimal category of statutorily preferred creditors, including statutory fees and
very limited amounts owed to Cayman Islands employees) do not have any preference or priority over foreign
creditors. This rule applies in relation to ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated creditors existing as at the date of the
presentation of the winding-up petition, or whose claims arise out of causes of action that accrued before the date of
the presentation of the winding-up petition. These will include creditors whose claims against the company arise out
of contract, common law and statutory torts, equitable claims, etc. Generally speaking, a creditor having a validly
created security interest over property of a company in liquidation is entitled to enforce his security without reference
to the official liquidators and without the leave of the Court.

As set out in greater detail below, preferred creditors under Cayman Islands law will rank ahead of unsecured
creditors of a company. Preferred creditors under the Companies Act will rank ahead of unsecured creditors and
secured creditors where the secured creditors’ security is in the nature of a floating charge. Furthermore, all costs,
charges and expenses properly incurred in the voluntary winding up of a company, including the remuneration of the
liquidators, are payable out of the assets of the company in priority to all other unsecured claims.

Enforcement against a Cayman Islands company may be limited by Section 86 of the Companies Act which
provides that a compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors or any class of them shall, if
sanctioned by the Court, be binding on all the creditors or any class of creditors. If there are creditors who form a
class, the class will be bound by the scheme if a majority in number representing 75% in value of the creditors or class
of creditors who attended and voted (whether in person or by proxy), approved the scheme. Cayman Islands authority
suggests that a class is constituted by “those persons whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for
them to consult together with a view to their acting in their common interest.” Two or more creditors are likely to
constitute separate classes in a compromise or arrangement if they hold security over different assets or hold security
over the same asset but do not rank equally (see “Scheme of Arrangement” below).

374


-----

Enforcement may be limited by Section 99 of the Companies Act which provides that, when a winding up
order has been made, any disposition of the company’s property and any transfer of shares or alteration in the status
of the company’s members made after the commencement of the winding up (such as where a winding up petition has
been presented) is, unless the Court otherwise orders, void.

Section 97 of the Companies Act provides:

(i) “when a winding up order is made or a provisional liquidator is appointed no suit, action or other
proceedings, including criminal proceedings, shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company except with
the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court may impose; and

(ii) when a winding up order has been made, any attachment, distress or execution put in force against the
estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the winding up is void.”

However, Section 142(1) of the Companies Act confirms that, notwithstanding that a winding up order has
been made, a creditor who has security over the whole or part of the assets of a company is entitled to enforce his
security without the leave of the Court and without reference to the liquidator.

It should also be noted that Section 96 of the Companies Act provides that a court in the Cayman Islands may
upon an application from the company or any creditor of contributory at any time after the presentation of the petition
for the winding up of a company and before the making of a winding up order, where any action or proceedings are
pending in a summary court, the Court, the Court of Appeal, the Privy Council or in a foreign court, restrain such
proceedings accordingly “on such terms as [the court] thinks fit.” In practice, the scope and effect of the stay under
Section 96 is the same as Section 97.

A liquidator may at any time give notice to a creditor whose debt is secured that he proposes, at the expiration
of 28 days from the date of the notice, to redeem the security at the value put upon it in the creditor’s proof.

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

Under Cayman Islands law there is no formal debtor-in-possession form of rehabilitation for companies in
financial distress. However, it is possible for an insolvent company to enter into a scheme of arrangement to try and
restructure its debts. Section 86 of the Companies Act provides for the approval of schemes of arrangement,
compromise and reconstruction agreed between a company and its members or a company and its creditors. The
application can be made by the company, a creditor or, if the company is in liquidation, by the liquidator. There is no
statutory obligation on a company or its directors to propose a scheme of arrangement.

Before the Court considers whether or not to sanction a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote
on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes,
depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such
creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by, among others, the company or its
creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the
meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approved
thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the Court) be binding
on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted
against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the Court at a sanction hearing where the Court will
review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The Court has discretion as to whether to
sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made to the scheme or reject
the scheme.

**_Priority of claims on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of liquidation under Cayman Islands law is to realise the assets of the insolvent
company and to distribute the cash realisations made from those assets to its creditors. Under Cayman Islands
insolvency law, creditors are placed into different classes and the proceeds from the realisation of the insolvent
company’s property is applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. Distributions generally cannot be
made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless
creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in
proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

375


-----

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

(a) First, in satisfaction of the rights of fixed charge creditors (although such assets are, strictly
speaking, outside of the liquidation) (Section 140(2) of the Companies Act);

(b) Secondly, in satisfaction of the claims of preferred creditors (to the extent that there are insufficient
assets to make payment of all preferential debts) (Section 140(2) of the Companies Act);

(c) Thirdly, in satisfaction of the claims of floating charge creditors (Section 140(2), Section 141(1) of
the Companies Act);

(d) Fourthly, in satisfaction of the provable debts of the unsecured creditors of the company (but having
regard to priority where a creditor is subordinated to other creditors) (Section 140(1) of the
Companies Act);

(e) Fifthly, in paying statutory interest on the proved debts (Section 149(2) of the Companies Act); and

(f) Sixthly, distribution of surplus assets to shareholders in accordance with their rights and interests.

There are circumstances under Cayman Islands law in which the granting by a Cayman Islands company of
security can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company becomes insolvent or is placed into
liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) following the granting of the security.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under Cayman Islands law in respects of Cayman
Islands law governed security interests:

**_Voidable preferences_**

Pursuant to Section 145(1) of the Companies Act, a transaction will constitute a voidable preference in the
following circumstances:

(i) a conveyance or transfer of property (or charge thereon) or payment obligation was made,
incurred, taken or suffered by the relevant company in favour of a creditor within 6 months
immediately preceding the commencement of liquidation of the company;

(ii) at the time when the conveyance or transfer of property or payment obligation was made,
incurred, taken or suffered, the company was insolvent (that is, unable to pay its debts);
and

(iii) the conveyance or transfer of property or payment obligation was made, incurred, taken or
suffered with a view to giving the creditor a preference over other creditors. Please note
that if the creditor is a “related party” (that is, an entity who has the ability to control the
relevant company or exercise significant influence over the relevant company in making
financial and operating decisions), the transfer of property or payment obligation will be
deemed to have been made with a view to giving such a creditor a preference.

If the above criteria can be satisfied with respect to the transfer of property or payment obligation, the
transaction will be invalid and a liquidator would be able to claw back the property or payment transferred.

**_Fraudulent dispositions_**

Under the Fraudulent Dispositions Act (1996 Revision) (the “Fraudulent Dispositions Act”) (in respect of
creditor actions) and pursuant to Section 146 of the Companies Act (in respect of liquidator actions), a transaction will
constitute a disposition at an undervalue in the following circumstances:

(i) a disposition (being any type of transfer, conveyance, assignment, lease, mortgage, pledge
or other transaction by which any legal or equitable interest in property is created,
transferred or extinguished) of property is made;

(ii) the disposition was made by the relevant company at an undervalue (which means for no
consideration or for consideration the value of which in money or monies worth is
significantly less than the value of the property the subject of the disposition); and

376


-----

(iii) the disposition was made with an intent to defraud its creditors (that is, an intention to
wilfully defeat an obligation or liability (which includes a contingent liability) owed to a
creditor which existed on or prior to the date of the disposition).

If the above criteria can be satisfied with respect to the disposition of property, the disposition shall be
voidable at the instance of the liquidator (under Section 146 of the Companies Act) and/or by the creditor thereby
prejudiced (under the Fraudulent Dispositions Act). No action or proceeding can be commenced by a liquidator or
creditor seeking to establish that a disposition of property constituted a disposition made at an undervalue more than
6 years after the date of disposition. The burden of establishing the intent to defraud lies with the official liquidator
and/or the creditor (as applicable).

**_Fraudulent trading_**

Pursuant to Section 147 of the Companies Act, if in the course of winding up of the company it appears that
any business of the company has been carried on with an intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of
any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the liquidator may apply to the Court to make such orders as it thinks
fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the
interests of the victims of the transaction. It is notable that this form of order does not involve the imposition of liability
for the company’s debts as such, but enables the Court to form a judgment as to the extent to which it is appropriate
to require each participant in a company’s fraudulent trading to contribute personally to the assets, so as to augment
the funds available for distribution to unpaid creditors/members (as applicable). Section 147 of the Companies Act
uses the term “persons” which enables liability to be imposed upon a wider circle of participants in any such activity
than merely directors and officers. It should be noted further that Section 147 of the Companies Act imposes no
restrictions in terms of the period of time prior to the company’s winding up during which the events must have taken
place in order for liability to be imposed.

An application seeking this type of relief is brought by a liquidator for the benefit of the company’s estate as
a whole and not merely for the benefit of individual creditors (in an insolvent liquidation) or individual members (in
a solvent liquidation).

**_Constructive trusts_**

A liquidator may cause the company to commence a proceeding against the directors of the company for
breach of fiduciary duty where, for example, the company (by its directors) knowingly divests itself of an asset at an
undervalue in breach of the directors’ duty to act in the best interests of the company. If the recipient of the asset knew
he/she/it was receiving it as a result of a breach of fiduciary duty, the Court may determine that the asset should be
impressed with a constructive trust such that the recipient will be deemed to be holding the asset on trust for the
company.

**_Equitable nature of mortgage over shares_**

The mortgage created by Topco over the shares of CP Cayman Limited to secure the obligations of Topco
under the Topco Payment Undertaking is governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands and comprises an equitable not
a legal mortgage. An equitable mortgage has certain disadvantages compared with a legal mortgage, including the fact
that an earlier security will have priority and a subsequent third party purchaser for value or legal mortgagee of the
shares mortgaged, who does not have notice of the equitable mortgage, will not be subject to it. The Court will not
recognise or enforce foreclosure (meaning the assumption by the mortgagee of beneficial ownership of the mortgaged
property and the extinction of the mortgagor’s equity of redemption therein) against the shares mortgaged pursuant to
the mortgage over the shares in CP Cayman Limited in the absence of foreclosure proceedings against Topco in the
Court, or a judgment in respect of foreclosure proceedings against Topco in the courts of another jurisdiction which
the Court is prepared to enforce in accordance with the usual principles applicable to the enforcement of foreign
judgments in the Cayman Islands.

**_Registration of security_**

The Cayman Islands does not have a central public filing system for registration of mortgages and charges
granted by Cayman Islands companies or relating to assets held by a Cayman Islands company (save for ships, planes
and intellectual property and land registered in the Cayman Islands and some other asset classes which would not
appear relevant to the current transaction). Where a security interest is created by a company (regardless of where the
asset is located), it is necessary under the Companies Act to enter any security interest granted by the company in the
register of mortgages and charges of the company (maintained by the company at its registered office in the Cayman

377


-----

Islands) (the “ROMC”), although failure to make such a registration is a technical breach of the Companies Act and
from a Cayman perspective such failure would not adversely impact the validity or priority of such a security interest.
Accordingly, it is possible for the Company to have created prior ranking valid security interests over the same assets
which is not identifiable from a review of the ROMC. Other than entering particulars of any agreements entered into
by a company creating security interests in its ROMC, it is not necessary that any transaction documents creating a
security interest be filed, recorded or enrolled with any governmental, regulatory or judicial authority in the Cayman
Islands in order to ensure the validity of the security interest.

Under the Companies Act, a person who has agreed to become a member of a Cayman Islands company and
whose name is entered on the Register of Members is deemed to be a member of that Cayman Islands company.
Accordingly, a failure to effect such an entry in the Register of Members may restrict the ability of the mortgagee to
enforce its rights over the shares in a Cayman Islands company in respect of the legal title thereto or realise its security
by selling the legal title of such shares to third parties. If the Cayman Islands company or its registered office provider
refuses to enter the mortgagee or its nominee in the Register of Members following enforcement of such security over
shares in a Cayman Islands company, it may be necessary to obtain a court order to compel such action. In addition,
section 99 of the Companies Act provides that when a winding up order has been made, any disposition of a Cayman
Islands company’s property and any transfer of shares or alteration in the status of a Cayman Islands company’s
members made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless the Court otherwise orders, void. Further, section
125 of the Companies Act provides that any transfer of shares, not being a transfer of shares with the sanction of the
liquidator, and any alteration in the status of a Cayman Islands company’s members made after the commencement
of a voluntary winding up is void. Depending on the circumstances, such provisions could affect the ability of the
mortgagee to enforce the security created over the shares in the Cayman Islands company.

It does not necessarily follow that, as a matter of Cayman Islands conflict of laws rules, priorities of
competing interests in the shares in a Cayman Islands company will be determined according to Cayman Islands
domestic rules as the jurisdiction of incorporation of a Cayman Islands company. In certain circumstances the issue
of priority may be determined according to the laws of the jurisdiction where the Register of Members of a Cayman
Islands company is situated, the laws of the jurisdiction where the relevant share certificates are situated or the laws
of a contract governing the deposit or custody of the shares in a Cayman Islands company.

**_Security over shares_**

As noted above, the security granted by Topco over the shares of CP Cayman Limited is an equitable share
mortgage, pursuant to which Topco as mortgagor will remain the registered holder of the mortgaged shares in CP
Cayman Limited’s Register of Members until enforcement following an event of default. On the occurrence of an
event of default whilst the mortgagee or its nominee will have the right to be entered as the holder of the mortgaged
shares on the internal Register of Members, it would hold the shares as ‘mortgagee in possession’ subject to the ‘equity
of redemption’ (detailed above). As mortgagee in possession the mortgagee cannot be regarded as the absolute owner
of the shares and would need to sell the shares to satisfy the debt returning the excess proceeds from the sale of the
shares to the mortgagor.

**_Fixed security and recharacterisation risk_**

It is the essence of a fixed charge that the person creating the charge does not have liberty to deal with the
assets which are the subject matter of the security in the sense of disposing of such assets or expending or appropriating
the moneys or claims constituting such assets and accordingly, if and to the extent that such liberty is given to Topco,
any charge constituted pursuant to the Topco Share Security Agreement entered into by Topco may operate as a
floating, rather than a fixed, charge. Depending upon the level of control actually exercised by the chargor, there is
therefore a possibility that the security granted thereunder would be regarded under the Cayman Islands law as a
floating charge. Floating charges have certain weaknesses, including the following:

(i) they have weak priority against purchasers and chargees (who are not on notice of any
negative pledge contained in the floating charge) of the assets concerned and against lien
holders, execution creditors and creditors with rights of set off;

(ii) the claims of a floating charge holder may be subject to prior claims of preferred creditors
under Cayman Islands law (explained in further detail below); and

(iii) they rank after fixed charges.

378


-----

**_Preferred creditors_**

Under Cayman Islands law, upon the liquidation of a Cayman Islands company such as Topco, when applying
the proceeds of assets realised in the course of a winding up subject to a debenture or floating charge created by the
company, the claims of a limited category of preferred creditors will take priority over the claims of creditors holding
the relevant security. On a winding up of Topco in the Cayman Islands, the following debts are preferential debts:

(i) any sum due by Topco to an employee, whether employed in the Cayman Islands or
elsewhere, in respect of salaries, wages and gratuities accrued during the four months
immediately preceding the liquidation;

(ii) any sum due and payable by Topco on behalf of an employee in respect of medical health
insurance or pension fund contributions;

(iii) any sum due in respect of severance pay and earned vacation leave where the employee’s
contract has been terminated as a result of the winding up;

(iv) any compensation payable to a workman in respect of injuries incurred at work pursuant
to the Workmen’s Compensation Act (1996 Revision); and

(v) certain taxes due to the Cayman Islands Government comprising sums payable under the
Customs and Border Control Act (2021 Revision), the Companies Act, the Stamp Duty Act
(2019 Revision) and the Tourist Accommodation (Taxation) Act (2013 Revision), and any
licence fees payable under regulatory laws.

**_Payment of dividends under Cayman Islands law_**

Under Cayman Islands law, dividends may only be declared by a Cayman Islands company out of funds
legally available for distribution so long as the company has the ability to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary
course of business.

**England and Wales**

Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Therefore, any insolvency
proceedings in respect of the such Guarantors would likely be commenced in England and conducted in accordance
with the requirements of English insolvency laws.

**The Insolvency Test**

The Insolvency Act 1986 has no test for or definition of insolvency per se but instead relies on the concept
of a company’s ‘inability to pay its debts’ as the keystone for many of its provisions. Pursuant to section 123 of the
Insolvency Act 1986, the circumstances in which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts include, among others,
the following: (i) if a creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served a
statutory demand on the company requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has failed for three
weeks to pay, secure or compound the sum; (ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable
to pay its debts as they fall due; or (iii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s
assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.

**Liquidation/Winding-Up**

Liquidation is a terminal insolvency process pursuant to which the assets of a company are realised by the
liquidator and the proceeds distributed to creditors in accordance with a statutory order of priority (see ‘Statutory order
of priorities’ below), with any surplus paid to the shareholders. Once the liquidator has completed this task, the
company will be dissolved and removed from the register of companies.

There are two different types of liquidation: (i) compulsory; and (ii) voluntary, which is in turn divided into
members’ voluntary liquidation (MVL) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (CVL).

Regardless of how a liquidator is appointed, a liquidator owes his or her duties to the company and its
creditors as a whole and has wide powers to do whatever necessary for the conduct of the liquidation. This includes
the power to: (i) agree, compromise and pay creditor claims; (ii) sell any of the company’s property; (iii) bring or
defend any legal proceedings on behalf of the company; (iv) disclaim onerous property or contracts in accordance
with section 178 of the Insolvency Act 1986; (v) bring actions against the directors or former directors; and (vi) bring
actions to set aside certain transactions.

379


-----

In a compulsory liquidation, there is an automatic stay on proceedings being commenced or continued against
the company or its property except with the permission of the court. In a voluntary liquidation, there is no such
automatic stay although the court may, upon the application of the liquidator or any creditor, or contributory of the
company, order a stay under its general discretionary power in section 112 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

_Compulsory liquidation_

Compulsory liquidation is a court-based procedure pursuant to which a creditor or one of the other parties
set out in section 124 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (including the company itself or the directors of the company
collectively) petitions for the winding up of a company and the court makes a winding up order. The grounds which
entitle the court to make a winding up order are set out in section 122 of the Insolvency Act 1986. The most common
grounds are that: (i) the company is unable to pay its debts (see “The Insolvency Test” above for the meaning of this
term); and (ii) it is just and equitable for the company to be wound up.

Pursuant to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, no petition for the winding up of a registered
company may be presented under section 124 of the Insolvency Act 1986 on or after 27 April 2020 to 30 June 2021
(the Relevant Period) on the basis of a statutory demand served between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.

A creditor may not present a petition under section 124 during the Relevant Period for the winding up of a
registered company on a ground specified in section 123(1)(a) to (d) of the Insolvency Act 1986 unless the creditor
has reasonable grounds for believing that (i) coronavirus has not had a financial effect on the company, or (ii) the facts
by reference to which the relevant ground applies would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had a financial effect
on the company. A creditor may also not present a petition under section 124 during the Relevant Period for the
winding up of a registered company on a ground specified in section 123(1)(e) or (2) of the Insolvency Act 1986
unless the creditor has reasonable grounds for believing that (i) coronavirus has not had a financial effect on the
company; or (ii) the relevant ground would apply even if coronavirus had not had a financial effect on the company.

Under section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986, any disposition of the company’s property, any transfer of the
company’s shares and any altering of the status of company members is void if made following the ‘commencement
of a winding up’ unless the court orders otherwise. Subject to certain exceptions, if a winding up order is made, it is
deemed to have commenced on the date on which the winding up petition was presented. This gives section 127
retrospective effect, meaning that any of the specified transactions carried out after the presentation of a winding up
petition will be void if a winding up order is subsequently made unless the company (or an interested party) has first
obtained a validation order from the court.

A liquidation does not in itself terminate financial or commercial contracts, but a liquidator does have the
power to disclaim onerous contracts and he or she can choose to breach a contract if he or she considers it to be in the
best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an unsecured debt – see
“Statutory order of priorities” below).

_Members’ voluntary liquidation_

A MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders
pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court.

Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the majority of the directors must
swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after making full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they have
formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts in full, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the
start of the liquidation.

_Creditors’ voluntary liquidation_

A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders passing a special resolution to place the company into
liquidation and has no court involvement. In contrast to a MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory
declaration of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent) and, after the shareholders’
meeting, the creditors’ must also resolve to place the company into liquidation. If the creditors choose a different
person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail unless any director, member or
creditor of the company successfully applies to the court for an order otherwise.

380


-----

**_Administration_**

The relevant English insolvency statute empowers English courts, upon receiving an application, to make an
administration order in respect of an English company in certain circumstances (the ‘in-court route’). An administrator
can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (the ‘outof-court route’). The in-court route is commenced by an application to court by the company itself, a majority of its
directors, and, where applicable, one or more of its creditors including contingent or prospective creditors, the
Financial Conduct Authority or the Prudential Regulation Authority or certain other designated persons. The out-ofcourt method of appointment is available only to the directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying
floating charge (QFC) (see further below for the meaning of this term). No physical court hearing is required and the
administrator’s appointment takes effect when the court stamps receipt of the relevant forms.

A QFC is defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 as being a floating charge
created by an instrument which: (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it; and/or (ii) purports to empower
the holder of the floating charge to appoint an administrative receiver and/or an administrator of the company. A
person is the holder of a QFC if that person holds one or more debentures of the company secured by charges and
other forms of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at
least one of which is a qualifying floating charge.

When any person other than a holder of a QFC makes an administration appointment (whether by the incourt or out-of-court route), it will be necessary to show that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its
debts (see ‘The Insolvency test’ above). Regardless of how an administrator is appointed, the administrator will need
to consent to act as administrator and to state that, in his or her opinion, one of the following statutory objectives can
be satisfied (the second objective can only be considered if the first objective is not reasonably practicable and
similarly for the third objective): (i) to rescue the company as a going concern; (ii) to achieve a better result for
creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up without first being in administration; or (iii)
to realise property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (see ‘Statutory order of
priorities’ below).

An interim moratorium takes effect when an application to appoint an administrator is made or a notice of
intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court. This becomes final once the company is in administration. The
moratorium means, among other things, that no other legal process or proceedings may be commenced or continued
against the company and no step can be taken to enforce security over the company’s property (in each case except
with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court), no administrative receiver can be appointed, no
resolution can be passed for the winding-up of the company and, except in certain limited circumstances, no order be
made for the winding-up of the company.

Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realise their security over that company’s
property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the administration
moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” (generally, cash or financial instruments such as
shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral
Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (Financial Collateral Regulations). During the administration of a company,
a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than security financial collateral arrangements)
without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court.

An administrator owes his or her duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. Upon appointment, an
administrator takes control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control of all property to
which the administrator thinks the company is entitled. He or she has broad powers to deal with the company and its
assets, except in respect of assets which are subject to fixed charge security (where powers are more restrictive). The
permission of the court is required to dispose of any such fixed charge assets, such permission will only be granted if
disposing of the property in question is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and the proceeds of sale are
paid to the fixed charge holder. An administrator’s powers further extend to investigating why the company failed
and, where appropriate, bringing actions against the directors or former directors or seeking to set aside certain
transactions.

An administration does not itself terminate any contracts and, unlike a liquidator, an administrator does not
have the power to disclaim or terminate contracts (although he or she can choose to breach a contract if he or she
considers it to be in the best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an
unsecured debt – see ‘Statutory order of priorities’ below).

381


-----

Following the enactment of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, contractual terms providing
for automatic termination or a right of termination by the counterparty of contracts of supplies of goods and services
upon the occurrence of an insolvency event (including administration) will generally be suspended for the duration of
the relevant insolvency procedure (see “Supplier Contracts” below).

**_Administrative Receivership_**

Section 72A(1) of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides that the holder of a QFC in respect of a company’s
property may not appoint an administrative receiver of the company subject to certain exemptions set out in sections
72B to 72GA.

Pursuant to section 72B of the Insolvency Act 1986, the first exception to this general prohibition is in the
context of capital markets. There are three limbs that have to be satisfied in order to qualify for this exception: (i) the
appointment is in pursuance of an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement; (ii) a party incurs,
or when the agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £50 million under the arrangement;
and (iii) the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment.

Each of the above three limbs is considered further below.

Pursuant to paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A to the Insolvency Act 1986, an arrangement is a capital market
arrangement if: (i) it involves a grant of security to (A) a person holding it as trustee for a person who holds a capital
market investment issued by a party to the arrangement; or (B) a party to the arrangement who issues a capital market
investment; or (C) a person who holds the security as trustee for a party to the arrangement in connection with the
issue of a capital market investment; or (D) a person who holds the security as trustee for a party to the arrangement
who agrees to provide finance to another party; or (ii) at least one party guarantees the performance of obligations of
another party; or (iii) at least one party provides security in respect of the performance of the obligations of another
party; or (iv) it involves an investment of a kind described in articles 83 to 85 of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (SI 2001/544), which relates to options, futures and contract for
differences (the Regulated Activities Order).

Paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 2A to the Insolvency Act 1986 states that a party to an arrangement includes a
party to an agreement which forms part of the arrangement, provides for the raising of finance as part of the
arrangement, or is necessary for the purposes of implementing the arrangement. Center Parcs notes that there is no
statutory definition or case law on the meaning of the term “arrangement”, however it is clear that an arrangement can
be more than just one agreement and in Center Parcs’ view the term is apposite to describe a series of inter-related
transactions.

Pursuant to paragraph 5 of Schedule 2A to the Insolvency Act 1986, the requirement to incur debt of at least
£50 million may be incurred at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement and may be expressed wholly
or partly in foreign currency (in which case the sterling equivalent shall be calculated as at the time when the
arrangement is entered into).

Pursuant to paragraph 2 of Schedule 2A to the Insolvency Act 1986, an investment is a capital market
investment if it: (i) is within article 77 or 77A of the Regulated Activities Order; and (ii) is rated, listed or traded or
designed to be rated, listed or traded.

To place a company into administrative receivership, the holder of a QFC must execute a document
appointing an administrative receiver in accordance with the terms of the security document pursuant to which the
QFC was created. This appointment document must then be delivered to the proposed administrative receiver and the
appointment takes effect upon receipt (provided that the administrative receiver formally accepts the appointment by
the end of the next business day). There is no statutory moratorium that takes effect in relation to or as a result of the
appointment of an administrative receiver.

The principal duty of an administrative receiver is to realise the assets of the company in order to repay the
principal and interest secured by the document pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed. An
administrative receiver generally has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets which derive from both
the security document pursuant to which he or she was appointed and Schedule 1 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (except
insofar as this is inconsistent with the terms of that security document). In exercising such powers, an administrative
receiver acts as agent of the company, unless and until it goes into liquidation. However, an administrative receiver
can only dispose of assets which are subject to prior ranking security with the permission of the court if the court is
satisfied that the disposal (with or without other property) would be likely to promote a more advantageous realisation

382


-----

of the company’s property than would otherwise be effected and on the condition that the proceeds of sale and any
difference between those and the open market value are paid to the holder of that security. Further, unlike an
administrator, an administrative receiver’s powers do not extend to bringing actions against the directors or former
directors or (except in very limited circumstances) seeking to set aside certain transactions.

Assets coming into the hands of the administrative receiver are applied in payment of Secured Debt, less any
costs of realisation, the preferential debts and the prescribed part (as to the meaning of which see ‘Statutory order of
priorities’ below).

**_Schemes of arrangement_**

Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction the
compromise of a company’s liabilities where such company is liable to be wound-up under the Insolvency Act 1986;
and in the context of a foreign company, all that is required is a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction. In
practice, the sufficient connection test has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s
COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance
documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case
will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether
or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and
reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on a detailed debt compromise in respect
of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected
by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be
proposed by the company or its creditors. If 75% or more by value and over 50% in number of those creditors present
and voting at the creditor meeting(s) vote in favour of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval
thresholds contained in the finance documents, that compromise will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding
on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of
arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of arrangement. In certain circumstances, a scheme of
arrangement can also result in the release of guarantees in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise. The
court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications
being made or reject the scheme.

**_Restructuring Plan_**

Pursuant to Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a
compromise or arrangement (a “Restructuring Plan”) proposed between a company and its creditors (or any class of
them) or its members (or any class of them) in circumstances where the company has encountered, or is likely to
encounter, financial difficulties that affect, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern.
The purpose of the Restructuring Plan is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of these financial
difficulties. Similar to a scheme of arrangement, the Restructuring Plan procedure is open to any company liable to be
wound up under the Insolvency Act 1986 (i.e. a foreign company may use the procedure provided that certain
conditions are met).

For a consensual plan (i.e. one where each class votes in favour) to be capable of being sanctioned by the
court, the Restructuring Plan must be approved by 75% by value of creditors or shareholders in each class (there is no
majority by number test as is the case with a scheme of arrangement). The applicant may also apply to the court to
exclude a class from voting if they have no genuine economic interest in the company. Unlike a scheme, if not all
classes have approved the Restructuring Plan as required for a consensual plan, dissenting classes may be crammed
down provided that: (i) no members of the dissenting class would be worse off under the Restructuring Plan than they
would be in the most likely alternative scenario (in the court’s view) if the Restructuring Plan is not sanctioned (the
‘relevant alternative’); and (ii) the Restructuring Plan is agreed by 75% by value of a class of creditors or (as the case
may be) shareholders who would receive a payment, or has a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event
of the relevant alternative. Even if the voting threshold is met, the court may nevertheless refuse to sanction the
Restructuring Plan if it is not ‘just and equitable’. If the Restructuring Plan is sanctioned, it will be binding on all
affected parties, including those who did not participate in the vote on the Restructuring Plan and those who voted
against the Restructuring Plan.

383


-----

**_Company voluntary arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act 1986, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator
as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which
entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors. Provided that the proposal is
approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors
who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured
creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75%
(by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of
unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement.
However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who proves in the
company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security.

**_Supplier contracts_**

One of the common challenges involved in using a formal process to rescue and restructure a company is
that it can trigger termination or other consequences under supply contracts. This makes the company vulnerable to
ransom creditors. New provisions have been introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 in
order to supplement the existing essential supplier regime (see below) to help the continuation of supply of goods and
services to companies in an insolvency process.

_Essential suppliers_

The essential supplier regime under sections 233 and 233A of the Insolvency Act 1986 (i) prevents the
suppliers from, where a company is subject to a qualifying form of insolvency procedure (including administration,
liquidation and a CVA) and a request is made by or with the concurrence of the insolvency officerholder for the giving,
after the date that insolvency procedure commenced or the CVA took effect (as applicable), of any essential supplies,
making it a condition of the giving of the supply, or doing anything which has the effect of making it a condition of
the giving of the supply, that any outstanding charges in respect of a supply given to the company before the effective
date are paid; and (ii) where a company enters administration or a CVA takes effect, subject to certain exceptions,
compels continued supply by restricting the effect of existing insolvency-related terms in contracts for the supply of
essential goods or services.

Essential supplies include such things as water, gas, electricity, communications services, wi-fi and chipand-pin devices.

_Other suppliers_

Section 233B of the Insolvency Act 1986 says that (subject to certain exceptions), if a company is subject to
a qualifying form of insolvency process (including the moratorium, restructuring plan, CVA, administration and
liquidation or where a court order is made summoning a meeting relating to a Restructuring Plan), (i) any provision
of a supply contract which provides any provision of a supply contract which provides that the contract or supply
would terminate, or any other thing would take place, or that the supplier would be entitled to terminate the contract
or the supply or do any other thing (for example, change payment or supply terms) because the company becomes
subject to the relevant insolvency procedure, will cease to have effect; (ii) suppliers will be unable to exercise any
entitlement arising before the start of the insolvency period to terminate the contract or the supply because of an event
occurring before the start of the insolvency period, for the duration of the insolvency period (which in some cases
could be measured in years) and (iii) suppliers will be unable to impose ransoms by demanding payment of outstanding
amounts in respect of pre-commencement supply as a condition of continuing supply.

The prohibitions apply to both new and pre-existing contracts and last for the duration of the process, which
in some cases could be measured in years. The prohibitions will continue to apply if the company enters into a second
insolvency process.Certain contracts involving financial services are excluded from the regime, including a capital
market arrangement. In addition, suppliers under the current essential supply regime (see above) and certain types of
entities (such as banks or insurance companies), whether such entities are the customer or the supplier, are excluded
from this regime. Additionally, the regime does not apply to insolvency-related terms of a contract for the supply of
essential goods or services which cease to have effect under section 233A of the IA86 (as described above).

384


-----

Suppliers may still terminate contracts or exercise other contractual rights (which would otherwise be
restricted by the provisions) if: (i) they receive consent from the company or officeholder; or (ii) the court is satisfied
that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. Supplier rights relating to events arising after
the insolvency process begins are not affected.

**_Statutory order of priorities_**

A liquidator or administrator will need to comply with the following statutory order of priority when he or she
distributes the proceeds of realised assets to a company’s creditors: (i) proceeds of realisations from assets subject to
a fixed charge are paid to the fixed charge holder (less any costs of realisation); (ii) any prescribed fees or expenses
of the official receiver, moratorium debts and certain “priority pre-moratorium debts” in circumstances where a
company has entered into a restructuring moratorium and subsequently entered into administration or liquidation
within 12 weeks beginning with the day after the end of the moratorium (iii) expenses of the liquidation or the
administration, which includes monies arising under a contract entered into by the administrator or liquidator, or any
necessary disbursements made in the ordinary insolvency process; (iv) ordinary preferential debts, which include (but
are not limited to) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes, wages and salaries of employees for work
done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person, holiday pay due to any
employee whose contract has been terminated and bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under
the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) up to the statutory limit; (v) secondary preferential debts, being
bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that the claims exceed the
statutory limit, deposits made through a non-EEA branch of a credit institution that would otherwise have been eligible
for FSCS compensation, and claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including
student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding
corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers;
(vi) subject to certain exceptions, the prescribed part, which is a ring fenced amount of money that the administrator
or liquidator must set aside from realisations from floating charge assets to distribute to unsecured creditors –
calculated as 50% of the first £10,000 of net realisations and 20% of the net realisations thereafter, up to a maximum
of £800,000 where the first ranking floating charge was created on or after 6 April 2020 (£600,000 if created before
then); (vii) proceeds of floating charge asset realisations (less any costs of realisation, the preferential debts and the
prescribed part), according to the priority of the security; (viii) provable debts of unsecured creditors (these rank
equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them) and any secured
creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up
to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings; (ix) statutory interest that arises on debts after
the insolvency at either the higher of the contractual and the official rate determined in accordance with the Judgments
Act 1838; and (x) non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and
which are therefore only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid.

Any surplus will be paid to the shareholders in accordance with the company’s articles of association. There
are no equitable subordination provisions under English law, meaning that an unsecured shareholder loan ranks as a
provable debt alongside other unsecured creditors and will not be subordinated by law.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that
is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are
only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency
set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their
mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation
of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if
amounts remain due to the company).

**_Fixed and floating charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security:
(a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash, or
use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to

385


-----

operate the charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder;
(b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge
over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallised at the time the fixed charge was
granted); (c) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s or administrator’s remuneration and the costs of
continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in a winding
up or administration are payable out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating
charge) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to
deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets
can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the
floating charge and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating
charge security; (e) in comparison to fixed charge security, floating charge security is subject to certain additional
challenges under English insolvency law; and (f) where the floating charge is not created or otherwise arising under a
“financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or
tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Regulations floating charge
security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions and
salaries owed to employees) and to ring-fencing of the “prescribed part” for unsecured creditors. This summary does
not set out an exhaustive statement of consequences of the distinction between fixed and floating security interests.
This summary does not set out an exhaustive statement of consequences of the distinction between fixed and floating
security interests.

Please note, however, that with prior approval of the court, an administrator may also deal with property
subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration
and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging
the obligations of the company to the charge holder.

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterise fixed security interests purported to
be created by a security document as floating charges; the description given to security interests by the parties is not
determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating
security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the
relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is
exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets or their proceeds in the
course of its business without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallisation, the court is likely to hold that the
security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge
in the security documents.

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be required
to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security (after making full
provision for preferential creditors and expenses (floating charge realisations)) for the benefit of unsecured creditors.
Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realisations and 20% of the remainder
over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 where the first ranking floating charge was created on or
after 6 April 2020 (£600,000 if created before then).

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into
administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) following the granting of the
guarantee or security.

The following potential grounds for challenge set out in the Insolvency Act 1986 may apply to guarantees
and security interests.

**_Transaction at an Undervalue (section 238)_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court
for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee, if such liquidator or administrator believes
that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. Section 118 of the
Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (the “SBEEA”) introduced section 246ZD to the Insolvency
Act 1986 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of action in
respect of any transaction under section 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Where a foreign officeholder has been granted

386


-----

recognition under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations, he or she also has standing to bring a claim for a
transaction at an undervalue.

There will only be a transaction at an undervalue, if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the
transaction, the English company was or became unable to pay its debts as a result of such transaction within the
meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986. The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters
into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the English company grants
the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue
if the company makes a gift to a person, if the receives no consideration of if the company receives consideration of
significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company.

However, a court generally will not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction
in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds
for believing that the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an
undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the
transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that
the company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency
Act 1986, as amended), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate
the solvency of the company in such proceedings.

**_Preference (section 239)_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the
creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. Section 118 of the SBEEA introduced
section 246ZD to the Insolvency Act 1986 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may
assign the cause of action in respect of any preference under section 239 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Where a foreign
officeholder has been granted recognition under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations he or she also has
standing to bring a preference claim.

There will only be a preference if, at the time the transaction was entered into, the company was or became
unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 as a consequence of its entry
into the transaction. The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into liquidation or administration
proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person)
or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the company takes the decision to grant the
security interest or the guarantee ending with the onset of insolvency. A transaction will constitute a preference if it
has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other
liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor,
guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines
that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it
would have been if that preference had not been given, which could, in this case, include reducing payments under
the Offered Notes (although there is protection for a third-party who enters into one of the transactions in good faith
and without notice). However, for the court to do so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the
company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator
or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced
by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in
which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and
the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence.

The desire to prefer requires a “positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the company’s
insolvent liquidation” (Re Fairway Magazines Ltd [1993] BCLC 643). A preferential effect for a creditor may be
foreseen by the company without being desired. Where a company is influenced by “proper commercial
considerations” there will be no desire to prefer and therefore no voidable preference (Re MC Bacon [1990] BCLC
324).

**_Transaction Defrauding Creditors (section 423)_**

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made
for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a
company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or

387


-----

may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. The fact that the
transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defence to the claim. It will suffice that the company’s
subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to
show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice.

An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by an administrator, a
liquidator the supervisor of a voluntary arrangement in certain circumstances and, subject to certain conditions, the
Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any
person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the permission of the court in the
case of a company in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. A foreign
officeholder recognised under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations also has standing to apply to court.

There is no time limit in the English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made and the
relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction (subject to the normal statutory limitation
periods). If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such
orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and
to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose
any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However,
such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor in
good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a
benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum
unless such person was a party to the transaction.

**_Avoidance of Floating Charge (section 245)_**

Under English insolvency law, if a company is unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of
the Insolvency Act 1986 at the time of (or as a result of) granting a floating charge, and the floating charge was granted
within the specified period referred to below, then such floating charge can be avoided except to the extent of the
aggregate of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any
debt of (and the amount of such interest payable in respect of the money paid, services supplied in reduction/discharge
in debt), the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge. This means that a floating
charge can be partly invalid to the extent that it is provided for past consideration. No court action is required save for
where there is a foreign officeholder recognised under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations who wishes to
attack the floating charge under article 23 of the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations.

The requirement for the company to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge
does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the floating charge is granted to a
connected person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below, then the floating
charge is invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied
to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of (and the amount of such interest payable in respect of the money paid,
services supplied in reduction/discharge in debt), the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the
floating charge, whether the relevant company is solvent or insolvent.

The granting of the floating charge can be challenged only if the relevant company enters into liquidation or
administration proceedings within a period of 12 months (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if
the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the relevant company grants the floating charge. However, if the
floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements
(No. 2) Regulations 2003, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph.

**_Extortionate credit transactions (section 244)_**

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit transaction,
the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, an assignee of such officeholder or a foreign
officeholder recognised under the UNCITRAL Implementing Regulations set the transaction aside. Section 118 of the
SBEEA introduced section 246ZD to the Insolvency Act 1986 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and
administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any
extortionate credit transaction claim under section 244 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

388


-----

A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either:
(i) its terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in
respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing.

The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up to
three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation (which is slightly
different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and preferences).

**_Orders_**

In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e. not section 245), the court
has very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before
the transaction was entered into.

389

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer, the Obligors and the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners entered into a
subscription agreement with respect to the Offered Notes dated        2021 (the “Subscription Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein, the Class B
Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners have agreed to subscribe and pay for the aggregate principal amounts of
the Offered Notes as set out opposite its name below.

**Principal amount of the Offered Notes**
Barclays Bank PLC ...........................................................................
HSBC Bank PLC ..............................................................................
**Total .................................................................................................** **£255,000,000**

The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners are entitled to fees and reimbursement of certain
expenses pursuant to the Subscription Agreement.

The Offered Notes will initially be offered at the price set forth herein.

The Subscription Agreement provides that the several obligations of the Class B Global Coordinators and
Joint Bookrunners to pay for and accept delivery of the Offered Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the
delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel. The Subscription Agreement also provides that the Issuer and the
Obligors upon accession to the Subscription Agreement will indemnify the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint
Bookrunners against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments
that the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners may be required to make in respect thereof.

Persons who purchase the Offered Notes from the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners may
be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of
purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

Delivery of the Offered Notes is expected to be made against payment on the respective Offered Notes on
2021, which is the    business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act) following
the date of pricing of the Offered Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+   ” (U.S.)). Under Rule
15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless
the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.

The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners may engage in over-allotment, stabilising
transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Joint Bookrunner.
Stabilising transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilising bids do not exceed
a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Offered Notes in the open market after the
distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim
a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Offered Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are
purchased in a stabilising or covering transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the offering of the Offered Notes, the Stabilising Manager, or a person acting on its behalf,
may engage in transactions that stabilise, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Offered Notes. Specifically, the
Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilise
the price of the Offered Notes. The Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over-allot the
offering of the Offered Notes, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Offered Notes in the
open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on its behalf,
may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and
impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilise or maintain the respective market price of the Offered Notes above
market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilising Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and
may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets
for, the Offered Notes.

**Selling Restrictions**

**_United States_**

The Offered Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered
or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except in certain transactions
exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

Each Class B Global Coordinator and Joint Bookrunner has agreed, severally and not jointly, that, except as
permitted by the Subscription Agreement, it will not offer or sell the Offered Notes (a) as part of their distribution at
any time or (b) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Offered Notes and
the Seventh Closing Date (the “Distribution Compliance Period”) within the United States to, or for the account or
benefit of, U.S. persons, and it will have sent to each dealer to which it sells Offered Notes during the Distribution
Compliance Period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Offered Notes
within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the
meanings given to them by Regulation S.

The Offered Notes are being offered and sold outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering of the Offered Notes, an offer or sale of
Offered Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering of the Offered Notes)
may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

The Issuer, the Obligors and the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners reserve the right to
reject any offer to purchase the Offered Notes, in whole or in part, for any reason. This Offering Memorandum does
not constitute an offer to any person in the United States or to any U.S. person. Distribution of this Offering
Memorandum to any person, other than to a non-U.S. person outside the United States and those persons, if any,
retained to advise such non-U.S. person outside the United States with respect thereto, is unauthorised, and any
disclosure without the prior written consent of the Issuer, as applicable, of any of its contents to any person, except to
a non-U.S. person outside the United States and to those persons, if any, retained to advise such non-U.S. person
outside the United States, is prohibited.

**_United Kingdom_**

Each Class B Global Coordinator and Joint Bookrunner has represented and agreed that it (i) has only
communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation
or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in
connection with the issue or sale of any Offered Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not
apply to the Issuer and (ii) has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Offered Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners have represented and agreed that they have not
offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Offered Notes to
any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means a person who
is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended,
“MiFID II”); or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance
**Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client**
as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.

**_Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors_**

The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners have represented and agreed that they have not
offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Offered Notes to

391


-----

any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means
a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations
made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation
(EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

**_General_**

Each Class B Global Coordinator and Joint Bookrunner has undertaken that it will not, directly or indirectly,
offer or sell any Offered Notes or have in its possession, distribute or publish any offering memorandum, prospectus,
form of application, advertisement or other document or information in any country or jurisdiction except under
circumstances that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, result in compliance with any applicable laws and
regulations and all offers and sales of the Offered Notes by it will be made on the same terms.

**_Other relationships_**

The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates may have performed
and continue to perform various financial advisory, investment banking and commercial banking services for, and
may arrange loans and other non-public market financing for, and enter into derivative transactions with, Center Parcs
and/or their affiliates (including its shareholders, the Issuer and the other Obligors) and for which they may receive
customary fees and expenses. The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates
may provide such services in the future. Entities affiliated with Barclays Bank PLC or any of its respective affiliates
are agents and other lenders under the Liquidity Facility Agreement. Additionally, in the ordinary course of their
business, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates may make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments
and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates (including the Notes).
The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners or their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship
with the Issuer routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Typically, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates would hedge
such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation
of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future
trading prices of the Notes. The Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates
may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such
securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions
in such securities and instruments.

SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS NOTE (OR ANY INTEREST HEREIN) TO A BENEFIT
PLAN INVESTOR OR ANY PERSON ACTING ON BEHALF OF A BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR.

ADDITIONALLY, IF THE BENEFICIAL OWNER HEREOF OR OF ANY INTEREST HEREIN IS, OR
IS ACTING ON BEHALF OF, A BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR, IT WILL BE FURTHER DEEMED TO
REPRESENT, WARRANT AND AGREE THAT (I) NONE OF THE ISSUER, CENTER PARCS OR
OTHER PERSONS THAT PROVIDE MARKETING SERVICES, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE
AFFILIATES, HAS PROVIDED ANY INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATION OR INVESTMENT
ADVICE ON WHICH IT, OR ANY FIDUCIARY OR OTHER PERSON INVESTING THE ASSETS OF
THE BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR (“PLAN FIDUCIARY”), HAS RELIED AS A PRIMARY BASIS IN
CONNECTION WITH ITS DECISION TO INVEST IN THIS NOTE, AND THEY ARE NOT
OTHERWISE UNDERTAKING TO ACT AS A FIDUCIARY, AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3(21) OF
ERISA OR SECTION 4975(e)(3) OF THE CODE, TO THE BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR OR THE PLAN
FIDUCIARY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR’S ACQUISITION OF THIS
NOTE, AND (II) THE PLAN FIDUCIARY IS EXERCISING ITS OWN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT IN
EVALUATING THE INVESTMENT IN THIS NOTE.

5. At the time of its acquisition and throughout the period in which it holds such Offered Notes or any
interest therein: (1) either (a) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor or a
governmental, church or non-U.S. plan that is subject to any Similar Law or (b) its acquisition,
holding and disposition of such Offered Notes (or any interest therein) will not constitute or result

any interest therein) to any transferee that is a Benefit Plan Investor or any person acting on behalf
of a Benefit Plan Investor. Any purported purchase, transfer, holding or disposition in violation of
these representations will be void. If such purchase, transfer, holding or disposition is not treated as
being void for any reason, the Offered Notes will automatically be transferred to a charitable trust
for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and the purported holder will acquire no right in the
Offered Notes.

If it is, or is acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor, (i) none of the Issuer, Center Parcs or other
persons that provide marketing services, or any of their respective affiliates, has provided any
investment recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person
investing the assets of the Benefit Plan Investor (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied as a primary basis
in connection with its decision to invest in the Offered Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking
to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the
Benefit Plan Investor or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the Benefit Plan Investor’s acquisition
of the Offered Notes, and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in
evaluating the investment in the Offered Notes.

It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Obligors, the Class B Registrar, the Class B Transfer Agent, the
Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and their affiliates and others will rely upon the
truth and accuracy of the above acknowledgements, representations and agreements and agrees that,
if any of the acknowledgements, representations or agreements deemed to have been made by it by
its purchase of Offered Notes is no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Issuer, the Obligors
and the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners. If it is acquiring any Offered Notes as
a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment
discretion with respect to each of those accounts and that it has full power to make the above
acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each account.

The purchaser and any fiduciary causing it to acquire an interest in any Offered Notes agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, the Obligors, the Class B Global Coordinators and Joint

and the rules and regulations of the SEC. However, pursuant to the Note Trust Deed and for as long as the Offered

15(d) of the Exchange Act, nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) thereunder, provide to any holder
or beneficial owner of such restricted securities or to any prospective purchaser of such restricted securities designated
by such holder or beneficial owner or to the Class B Note Trustee, for delivery to such holder, beneficial owner or
prospective purchaser, in each case upon the request of such holder, beneficial owner, prospective purchaser or the
Class B Note Trustee, the information required to be provided by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

398


-----

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN JUDGMENTS**

The Issuer is a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Jersey. The assets of the Issuer
are located outside of the United States. In addition, none of the directors or officers and other executives of the Issuer
is a resident or citizen of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process
within the United States upon the Issuer, or such persons, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. federal or state
courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws or otherwise despite the fact
that, pursuant to the terms of the Note Trust Deed, the Issuer has appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service
of process in New York.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. federal or state court against the Issuer, investors will need to enforce such
judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. federal or
state court judgments outside the United States is described below for the jurisdictions in which the Issuer and its
assets are located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed for advice on
enforcing a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**Jersey**

The Issuer is incorporated in Jersey. The United States and Jersey currently do not have a treaty providing
for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial
matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based
on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be
recognised or enforceable in Jersey. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Jersey, proceedings must first be
initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an action, a Jersey court would not generally
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would
usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defence to it).
Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Jersey court in such an action is conditional upon (among other
things) the following:

    - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflicts of
laws principles;

    - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable
in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt or definite sum of money (although there are
circumstances where non-money judgments can also be recognised);

    - the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy;

    - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature,
or in respect of a penalty or fine;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying, a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of
Section 5 of the United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to Jersey
by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983);

    - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of natural
justice or rights under the European Convention on Human Rights; and

    - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same matter.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial matters
that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, Center Parcs cannot assure you that those
judgments will be recognised or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a Jersey court would
accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Jersey, instead of the United
States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**England and Wales**

The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in England and
Wales is based upon advice provided to Center Parcs by its English legal advisors. The United States and the United
Kingdom currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as

399


-----

opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment of a U.S. federal or
state court in relation to the obligations of the Issuer under the Note Trust Deed, the Offered Notes and the Subscription
Agreement will not be automatically enforceable in England and Wales, but a final and conclusive judgment for a
debt or definite sum of money may be enforced at common law in England and Wales provided that the party against
whom the judgment was given properly submitted to the jurisdiction of the relevant courts (in accordance with English
rules on the conflict of laws), and none of the following circumstances applies:

    - the judgment was procured by fraud;

    - judgment was given contrary to the English rules of natural justice, for example the defendant was
deprived of notice of, or an adequate opportunity to take part in the proceedings, or substantial
justice, in that the defendant did not have the opportunity to correct procedural irregularities under
the laws of the court giving judgment;

    - recognition of the judgment would be contrary to English public policy;

    - recognition of the judgment would violate the Human Rights Act 1998;

    - the judgment conflicts with an English judgment or a foreign judgment given earlier in time that is
enforceable in an English court;

    - the proceedings that resulted in the judgment were brought in breach of a binding arbitration
agreement or a contractual choice of court agreement or where recognition or enforcement of the
judgment would be contrary to the terms of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982;

    - enforcement of the judgment would involve the enforcement of foreign taxes, fines or penalties
(which involves payment to the State as distinct from an individual) or revenue or other public law;

    - enforcement of the judgment would contravene the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980, Section
5 of which precludes, among other things, the enforcement in the United Kingdom of any judgment
given by a court of an overseas country which is a judgment for multiple damages which exceed the
compensatory element of the judgment award; or

    - enforcement of the judgment is time barred or outside any limitation periods.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, Center Parcs cannot assure
you that those judgments will be enforceable in England and Wales.

In addition, an English court may decline to accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action
was commenced in England and Wales in breach of a binding arbitration agreement or a contractual choice of court
agreement.

**Cayman Islands**

There is a procedure under Cayman Islands law for the registration of foreign judgments of superior courts
for the purposes of their enforcement under the Foreign Judgments Reciprocal Enforcement Act (1996 Revision) (the
“Foreign Judgments Act”). However, so far the Foreign Judgments Act has only been extended to certain superior
courts of Australia and its External Territories. Accordingly, judgments obtained in U.S. federal or state courts can
only be enforced in the Cayman Islands pursuant to Cayman Islands common law.

Subject to certain exceptions, a judgment obtained in a U.S. federal or state court may be enforced pursuant
to Cayman Islands common law without any re-examination of the merits if: (i) the judgment is an _in personam_
judgment under which a sum of money is payable (other than a sum of money payable in respect of taxes, fines or
other penalties) or, in certain circumstances, an in personam judgment for non-monetary relief; (ii) such U.S. court
had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment as a matter of Cayman Islands conflict of law rules;
(iii) the judgment was not obtained by fraud; (iv) enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to Cayman
Islands public policy; (v) the proceedings in the U.S. court did not contravene rules of natural justice; and (vi) the
judgment is final and conclusive.

There is doubt, however, as to whether the Court will: (i) recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts based
on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state or other jurisdiction thereof; or

400


-----

(ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, impose liabilities upon the civil liability provisions of the
securities laws of the United States or any state or other jurisdiction thereof. The Court may also stay local proceedings
if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.

 Strategic report  For the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020

The Directors present their Strategic report on the Group for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (2019: 52 weeks
ended 25 April 2019).

**Review of the Business**
The principal activity of the Group is the operation of short break holiday villages. The Center Parcs business
operates five holiday villages in the United Kingdom, at Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, Elveden Forest in
Suffolk, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Whinfell Forest in Cumbria and Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire. Center Parcs
targets the premium sector of the UK family short break market, offering an escape from the stresses and strains of
modern life and helping families come together.

Center Parcs invests heavily to ensure that we deliver high quality service, accommodation and facilities, combined
with an unrivalled array of activities that cater for the most discerning of families, as well as the most changeable of
British weather. There is nothing prescriptive about a short break at Center Parcs, with each family free to choose to
do as little or as much as they wish. Center Parcs remains a unique proposition for families in the UK market with a
history of consistently high occupancy and continued revenue and EBITDA growth, prior to the impact of the Covid19 pandemic (see below). This is combined with enviable guest feedback scores and consistently high levels of
returning guests.

Each of the Group’s holiday villages is set in a forest environment amongst approximately 400 acres of forest and
lakes and is normally open 365 days per year. Woodland, water and a natural environment are the essential
elements of a Center Parcs break. Within the comfortable, quiet and family-friendly setting, the Center Parcs villages
provide guests with high-quality accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. There are over 4,300
units of accommodation across the five villages. The focal point and key attraction of each village is an all-weather
indoor sub-tropical swimming paradise, featuring a selection of water activities including a wave pool, river slides and
rides, children’s pools and jacuzzis. Other on-site experiences include outdoor activities such as cycling, boating and
quadbikes; indoor activities such as ten-pin bowling, badminton and pottery; and leisure amenities such as spas,
dining and retail.

_Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic_

Following UK Government advice in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group’s five holiday villages were closed
to guests on 20 March 2020 and remained closed as at 23 April 2020. All guests who had their short breaks
cancelled due to the village closures were contacted and offered either a replacement holiday at a later date (with a
financial incentive) or a full refund of amounts paid. It was originally announced that the villages would remain closed
until 14 May 2020. However, in line with government guidance, as the pandemic worsened this was revised a
number of times until the villages were able to re-open on 13 July 2020, albeit with reduced accommodation capacity
and guest activities.

At the financial period-end approximately 90% of the Group’s employees were furloughed under the UK
Government’s Job Retention Scheme. The Group also benefited from the 12-month business rates holiday
announced for the leisure industry and agreed with HMRC that certain tax liabilities can be deferred.

In addition to Government support measures the Business took decisive action to reduce remaining operating costs
during the periods of closure. Residual operating costs of £11.0m were incurred in the period from closure on 20
March 2020 to the financial year-end on 23 April 2020. In the subsequent period to 13 July 2020 when the villages
remained closed, costs averaged between £6m and £7m every 4 weeks.

The Group continues to actively monitor developments and government advice and will increase available
accommodation capacity and guest activities as soon as it is safe and practicable to do so. Activities to ensure
adherence with this advice include hand sanitisation stations, deep cleaning of accommodation between departing
and arriving guests, increased cleaning and disinfection of public areas and social distancing measures throughout
the villages. This will enable guests to enjoy their breaks in the knowledge that the highest standards in relation to
Covid-19 have been put in place.

The Group also took swift action to ensure a strong liquidity position was maintained and promptly secured additional
funding from the Group’s owner, Brookfield. As at 15 July 2020, £139m of funds were provided with a further £21m
approved for use if required. In addition to this Brookfield have also indicated that additional funding could be made
available should the need arise.

###### Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited

 Strategic report  For the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)

_Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic (continued)_

Current trading patterns indicate there remains strong demand for the Group’s breaks through the third and fourth
quarters of our financial year ending 22 April 2021, with bookings for quarter four significantly ahead of the same time
last year as at 15 July 2020. Therefore, the fundamentals of the Company’s model remain sound and give comfort
that demand is there as operations resume.

Whilst at this stage it is too early to know the full impact of the pandemic on the financial year ending 22 April 2021,
the result and financial position of the Company is likely to be significantly impacted by the temporary suspension of
operations and the consequent refund of customer deposits.

_Going concern_

As described in note 1, the Directors have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis as they
believe the actions taken to date, together with the Group’s current liquidity position and contingency plans to secure
additional funding, will allow the Group to continue its activities. However, although the Directors are confident in the
Group’s current position, given the village closures until 13 July 2020 and an uncertain pace of recovery, the
Directors recognise that there exists a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the application of
the going concern assumption in the financial statements.

_Financial performance_

The results of the Group for the period show a profit after taxation of £23.0 million (2019: profit of £62.8 million).
Adjusted EBITDA, being earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional/non-underlying
items was £200.0 million (2019: £232.6 million). These results were negatively impacted by the closure of the UK
holiday villages on 20 March 2020 in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, as set out in note 5.

During the period the Group incurred exceptional/non-underlying administrative costs of £2.2 million, representing
£2.0 million in respect of costs to exit a contract and £0.2 million of legal and other associated costs relating to an
equity contribution provided by the Group’s parent company. Taxation on these expenses has also been treated as
an exceptional/non-underlying item, as has the impact of the change in applicable deferred tax rate from 17% to 19%.

During the prior period ended 25 April 2019, the Group incurred an exceptional/non-underlying finance cost of £7.7
million in respect of a refinancing of the Group’s debt. Taxation on this expense was also treated as an
exceptional/non-underlying item.

**Key performance indicators**
The Directors use the following key performance indicators to set targets and measure performance:

  - Revenue: Revenue for the period was £443.7 million (2019: £480.2 million).

  - Adjusted EBITDA: Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional/nonunderlying items. Adjusted EBITDA for the period was £200.0 million (2019: £232.6 million).

  - Occupancy: the average number of units of accommodation occupied as a percentage of the total number
available. Occupancy for the period was 88.0% (2019: 97.1%).

  - ADR (Average Daily Rate): the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total accommodation
income divided by the total number of lodge nights sold. ADR for the period was £194.91 (2019: £191.74).

  - RevPAL (Rent per available lodge night): the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total
accommodation income divided by the total available number of lodge nights. RevPAL for the period was
£171.54 (2019: £186.08).

The key performance indicators above were negatively impacted by the closure of the UK holiday villages on 20
March 2020 in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.

###### Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited

 Strategic report  For the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)

**Principal risks and uncertainties**
The Directors and senior managers adopt a proactive approach to the management of potential risks and
uncertainties which could have a material impact on the performance of the business and execution of its growth
strategy, and are actively involved in the Group’s Risk Committee. In addition to ongoing monitoring, this Risk
Committee meets quarterly to oversee risk management arrangements and ensure appropriate processes are put in
place to mitigate potential risks and uncertainties. The Fire, Health and Safety Steering Committee also meets bimonthly to oversee operational risks.

There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the Group’s
performance and execution of its growth strategy. These risks include, but are not limited to:

Operational risk factors

_Health and safety_
The health, safety and welfare of the Group’s guests and employees are central to its operations. The Group is
committed to maintaining industry leading standards in health and safety including fire and food safety and adopts a
proactive approach to its safety management. All incidents are recorded and reviewed to monitor trends and capture
learning points that are then integrated into the business. The Fire, Health and Safety Steering Committee reviews
major incidents and is focused on continuous improvement to mitigate the risk.

_Business continuity_
The Group operates five holiday villages in the United Kingdom and a significant interruption of any one would have a
material impact on the Group. As a result, the Risk Committee supervises comprehensive risk management
arrangements including business continuity plans which are regularly tested with the support of external specialists.
These arrangements are supported by a broad insurance programme. The revenue loss resulting from the closure of
the villages due to the Covid-19 pandemic was not covered by the Group’s insurance.

_Supply chain_
The Group has a large number of suppliers and prides itself on the quality of its product. The Group could be
adversely affected by a fall in the standard of goods or services supplied by third parties or by a failure of a key
partner. Quality risks are mitigated via a robust supplier registration system with food and safety further supported by
independent advisors. In addition, the Risk Committee considers supply chain contingency arrangements and takes
appropriate measures to mitigate this risk.

_Contractual arrangements_
The Group has contracts with third parties for the supply of goods and services. Contracts are negotiated at arms’
length and the Group does not enter into contracts that are outside the ordinary course of business or those that
contain onerous terms. The Group adopts a compliance programme to ensure that it is compliant with its material
contractual commitments. There is no single contractual counterparty that is critical to the running of the business.
The failure of any critical contractual counterparty is managed through supply chain contingency arrangements (see
Supply chain).

_Employees_
The Group’s performance largely depends on its managers and staff, both on the villages and at head office. The
resignation of key individuals or the inability to recruit staff with the right experience and skills could adversely impact
the Group’s results. To mitigate these issues the Group has invested in training programmes for its staff and has a
number of bonus schemes linked to the Group’s results and achievement against key performance indicators linked
to guest satisfaction that are designed to reward and retain key individuals.

_Input price increases_
The Group’s margin can be adversely affected by an increase in the price of key costs to the business including, but
not limited to, wages, overheads and utilities. The Group takes proactive steps to manage any such increases
including cost control, forward buying and budgeting for any increase.

_Brand_
The Center Parcs brand could be adversely affected by a serious incident, accident or similar occurrence or just a
slow decline in the brand’s appeal to consumers. The Group mitigates the risk of a serious incident, accident or
similar occurrence by maintaining industry-leading health and safety systems and standards of training. The risk of a
slow decline in the brand’s appeal is managed through continuous product innovation, marketing campaigns and
brand development.

###### Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited

 Strategic report  For the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)

**Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)**

_Fraud_
The Group operates five sites across the United Kingdom. Risk of fraud exists in misappropriation of assets,
including banking, theft of stock and theft of cash takings. The Group mitigates this risk through the management
structure and regular financial review with, and extensive use of, business systems. In addition, the Group’s internal
audit function undertakes regular reviews of financial controls with particular focus on cash and stock transactions.
The Group is also subject to regular external audits.

Market risk factors

_General Economic conditions_
The disposable income of the Group’s guests and/or their holiday preferences are and will be affected by changes in
the general economic environment and this may result in a fall in the number of guests and/or a decrease in on-site
expenditure. The Group regularly reviews its product offering and engages with guests to ensure it provides value for
money to meet guest needs.

_Brexit_
Until the terms of the UK’s formal exit from the European Union are finalised it remains difficult for businesses to
predict the impact it will have on them and their financial performance. Thus far, the formal exit as not had a material
impact on the business of Center Parcs. However, we will continue to monitor political and economic developments
and have plans in place for all eventualities.

_Covid-19 pandemic_
Starting with the closure of the villages in March 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the
Group’s business. Whilst the villages are now re-opened the situation continues to evolve with government advice
being regularly updated. The measures mandated by the government are outside the control of the Group.
However, the Group has experienced teams who are capable of managing the impacts of the disruption on guests,
colleagues and other key stakeholders. These teams have already put in place procedures to ensure the safe reopening of the villages and will continue to monitor changing advice and implement further procedures as required.

Although the villages are now open it is not clear how long government restrictions and social distancing measures
will last, or whether tighter restrictions will be reintroduced resulting in one or more villages having to close again. It
is therefore not certain how quickly operations will return to pre-crisis levels.

If these risks and uncertainties materialise, they could result in a material change in the forecast liquidity position of
the Group.

_Competition_
The Center Parcs brand is synonymous with high quality short breaks in a forest environment but the Group
competes for the discretionary expenditure of potential guests, who could choose to take short breaks at other
destinations or participate in other recreational activities. The Directors believe that this risk is mitigated by the
strength of the Center Parcs brand and the continual investment in the accommodation and central facilities
(including retail and restaurants), coupled with the innovation amongst the leisure activities and the responsiveness
to guest surveys.

_Seasonality and weather_
Demand for short breaks is influenced by the main holiday periods at Easter, the Summer holidays and the
Christmas/New year period. This risk is mitigated by online dynamic pricing which encourages demand outside of
the peak periods. The accommodation is located within forest environments and a significant number of activities
take place outdoors. Therefore, demand may be impacted by the prevailing weather. This risk is minimal because
guests tend not to book on impulse and the vast majority of breaks and activities are booked in advance.
Additionally, the Group maintains diversity between its indoor and outdoor activities to mitigate this risk.

###### Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited

 Strategic report  For the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)

**Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)**

Financial risks
The Directors and senior managers regularly review the financial requirements of the Group and the associated risks.
The Group does not use complicated financial instruments and where financial instruments are used they are used to
reduce interest rate risk. The Group does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. The Group finances its
operations and developments through a mixture of retained earnings and borrowings as required. Historically, the
Group has sought to reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Group funding using the underlying
asset value.

All tranches of the Group’s secured debt are subject to financial covenants. The Directors have assessed future
compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial covenants.

_Interest rate risk_
Principal sources of borrowings are fixed interest rate loan notes.

_Liquidity risk_
The Group maintains sufficient levels of cash and committed funding to enable it to meet its medium-term working
capital, lease liability and funding obligations. Rolling forecasts of liquidity requirements are prepared and monitored,
and surplus cash is invested in interest bearing accounts.

_Currency risk_
Whilst no borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies, a number of suppliers are exposed to the Euro and US
Dollar. Accordingly, wherever possible the Group enters into supply contracts denominated in Sterling. The Group
does not operate a hedging facility to manage currency risk as it is not considered to be material.

_Credit risk_
The Group’s cash balances are held on deposit with a number of UK banking institutions. Credit risk in respect of the
Group’s revenue streams is limited as the vast majority of customers pay in advance.

_Financial reporting risk_
The Group’s financial systems are required to process a large number of transactions securely and accurately; any
weaknesses in the systems could result in the incorrect reporting of financial results and covenant compliance. This
risk is mitigated by the production of detailed management accounts which are regularly compared to budgets and
forecasts. The Group is also subject to an annual external audit.

###### Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited

 Strategic report  For the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)

**Section 172 Statement and our stakeholders**

We report here on how our Directors have discharged their duties under Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 and
this statement reflects the contribution by the Group to the performance of the Center Parcs business.

Section 172 sets out the matters to which the Directors must have regard to in performing their duty to promote the
success of the Group for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes having regard to other stakeholders and the
likely consequences of any decision in the longer term. The Board considers it crucial that the Group maintains a
reputation for high standards of business conduct.

The Board is responsible for setting, monitoring and upholding the culture, values, standards, ethics, brand and
reputation of the Group, to ensure that our obligations to our guests, employees, shareholder and others are met.
Management drives the embedding of the culture and values throughout the business. The Board monitors
adherence to the Center Parcs policies and compliance with corporate governance requirements. The Board also
considers the wider social issues within which our businesses operate, including the environment and the local
communities in which our villages are situated. We look to build relationships with all our stakeholders based on
openness and continuing dialogue. We value diversity and inclusivity in our workforce and beyond and the employee
section of this report provides further details.

The Board considers the likely consequences of any decision in the long term and identifies stakeholders who may
be affected and carefully considers their interests and any potential impact as part of the Board’s decision-making
process.

In March 2020, following legislation passed by the UK Government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the
Group’s five holiday villages were closed to guests and remained closed as at 23 April 2020. Given the risk posed by
the Covid-19 pandemic, the health, safety and well-being of our employees and guests was our highest priority
throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. We also considered the interests of our shareholders, suppliers and other
stakeholders during this period. Guests who had their short breaks cancelled due to the village closures were
contacted and offered either a replacement holiday at a later date or a full refund of amounts paid. Employees who
were furloughed under the UK Government’s Job Retention Scheme received top up payments. Communications
with our employees, guests and other stakeholders were open, transparent and timely throughout this rapidly
evolving period.

The Directors present their report and the audited consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 23 April
2020 (2019: 52 weeks ended 25 April 2019).

The registration number of the Company is 07656429.

Information about the use of financial instruments by the Group is provided in note 17 to the financial statements.

**Future developments**

No changes to the nature of the business are anticipated in the longer term, but trading practices are expected to be
different in the short-term in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.

On 29 July 2019, Center Parcs Ireland Limited, a related party company, opened a new Center Parcs holiday village
in the Republic of Ireland. Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited and Center Parcs Ireland Limited have the same
ultimate parent company.

**Dividends**
During the period the Company paid dividends totalling £61.2 million (2019: £183.2 million). Of this total, the
Company distributed cash of £61.2 million and receivables of £nil (2019: cash of £183.0 million and receivables of
£0.2 million). The Directors have not proposed the payment of a final dividend (2019: final dividend of £20.1 million).

**Directors**
The Directors who served during the period and up to the date of this report, unless otherwise stated, were as
follows:

M P Dalby
C G McKinlay
Z B Vaughan
K O McCrain (resigned on 11 May 2020)
N J Adomait
B T Annable (appointed on 11 May 2020)

The Group headed by Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited maintains Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance in
respect of legal action that might be brought against its Directors and Officers that may be incurred as a result of their
position within the Company and the companies within the Group. The Directors and Officers have the benefit of an
Indemnity provision in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. These indemnities were in place for
the whole of the period ended 23 April 2020 and as at the date of this report.

**Employees**
The Group is committed to providing equal opportunities to all employees, irrespective of their gender, sexual
orientation, marital status, race, nationality, ethnic origin, disability, age or religion. Center Parcs is an inclusive
employer and values diversity among its employees. These commitments extend to recruitment and selection,
training, career development, flexible working arrangements, promotion and performance appraisal.

_Disabled employees_
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the
applicant concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled every effort is made to ensure that their
employment with the Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the
training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of
other employees.

_Employee consultation_
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and has continued to keep them informed
on matters affecting them as employees and on the various factors affecting the performance of the Group. This is
principally achieved through formal and informal briefings, the quarterly internal Group magazine ‘Center Forward’
and annual presentations of the financial results by the CEO. Employee representatives are consulted regularly on a
wide range of matters affecting their current and future interests, via village and head office council meetings which
take place four times a year. In addition, all employees with more than six months’ service receive an annual bonus
related to the overall profitability of the Group.

**Political donations**
No political donations were made in the current or prior period.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic report, the Directors' report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period. Under that law the
Directors have prepared the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial
statements, the Directors are required to:

            - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

            - make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

            - state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been followed; and

            - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group
and Company will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Group's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on
the Group's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

**Statement of disclosure of infonnation to the auditor**
In accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, in the case of each Director in office at the date the
Directors' report is approved, the following applies:

a) so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group's auditor is
unaware; and
b) he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make him/herself
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group's auditor is aware of that information.

**Independent auditor**
Deloitte LLP are deemed to be reappointed under section 487 (2) of the Companies Act 2006.

 Independent auditor’s report to the members of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited

**Report on the audit of the financial statements**

**Opinion**

In our opinion:

   - the financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries
(the ‘Group’) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at
23 April 2020 and of the Group’s profit for the 52 weeks then ended;

   - the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union;

   - the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act
2006; and

   - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006.

We have audited the financial statements which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of
Comprehensive Income, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent Company Cash
Flow Statements, the Group and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 30.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.

**Basis for opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’)
Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Material uncertainty related to going concern**
We draw attention to Note 1 in the financial statements, which indicates that as a result of the adverse impacts of
COVID-19 on both Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited directly and the wider travel, hospitality and leisure industry,
there is uncertainty in relation to forecasting the nature and extent of government and social distancing restrictions
that would impact the villages, the impact of consumer sentiment and hence the length of time it will take to achieve
a full recovery, uncertainty in relation to the ability of the Company to secure additional funding which may be
required in certain scenarios and uncertainty over the ability of the Company to obtain waivers for any forecast
potential breach of financial covenants. As stated in Note 1, these events or conditions, along with the other matters
as set forth in Note 1 to the financial statements, indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant
doubt on the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

**Other information**
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in
the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to
report that fact.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

###### Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited

 Independent auditor’s report to the members of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited (continued)

**Responsibilities of Directors**
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as
the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on FRC’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

**Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

   - the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

   - the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the Parent Company and their environment
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic report or the
Directors’ report.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report in respect of the following matters if, in our opinion:

   - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

   - the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

   - certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

   - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

**Use of our report**
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

The Group reported a profit for the year of £23.0m (2019 £62.8m) and generated operating cash inflows of £151.2m
(2019 £225.2m). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The
Directors consider this to be appropriate for the reasons set out below.

_Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic_
As at the date of approving these financial statements the impacts of Covid-19 on the Group’ trading have been
assessed. Government response to the pandemic continues to evolve and customer sentiment to short break
holidays remains uncertain although there are indications of strong demand for Center Parcs breaks. As such, the
Group will continue to monitor and re-assess the impact of the pandemic.

Due to measures taken by the UK Government all UK villages were closed to guests on 20 March 2020 and
remained closed until 13 July 2020. This resulted in all affected guests in that period being offered either a full refund
or the option to move their break to a later date. During the closure period, the Group reported no revenue and whilst
there has been a corresponding reduction in variable costs, the Group had to fund its fixed costs and refund guests
for breaks that were cancelled. Where possible mitigating actions have been taken by management to minimise such
costs. Refunds of £62 million have been given to affected guests as at the date of issuance of these financial
statements.

On 13 July 2020 all UK villages re-opened to guests albeit with social distancing restrictions in place. These
restrictions result in reduced available accommodation capacity and on-site activities which are likely to remain
impacted until such restrictions are lifted. Whilst it is difficult to predict the future with any certainty, we currently do
not anticipate a return to pre-Covid trading levels until early in calendar year 2021. However, demand for the Group’s
breaks do remain strong and current forward bookings for the final quarter of the financial year ending 22 April 2021
are ahead of those seen for the equivalent period in the year to 23 April 2020 at this time last year.

In order to preserve liquidity during the closure period, the Group took the following measures:

  - Secured additional funding from the Group’s owner, Brookfield. As at 15 July 2020 they had provided
funding of £139 million of funds to ensure the liquidity of the Group. Further committed funds of £21 million
are approved for use if required and Brookfield have indicated that additional funding could be made
available should the need arise.

  - A significant element of the Group’s cost base relates to wages and salaries. The majority of the Group’s
staff were furloughed during the period of closure with the Group benefitting from the Government’s job
retention scheme. The hours of remaining staff undertaking essential activities were reviewed to further
reduce costs where possible.

  - Reviewed all remaining areas of operating cost to eliminate all non-essential expenditure.

  - Agreed deferrals of certain tax payments and benefitted from Business rates relief.

  - Reviewed capital expenditure and delayed certain non-essential projects.

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)**

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Going concern (continued)**

The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for a period of 18 months from the date of approval of these
financial statements which indicate that, under the re-opening scenario noted above, the Group will have sufficient
funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due for that period. Under this scenario there would be no breach of lending
facilities. Other than £0.1m of mortgage repayments there are no capital repayments of debt falling due within the
forecast period.

With regard to this forecast and other factors which may impact the Group’s future liquidity position, the Directors
have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. However, given
that the Covid-19 situation continues to evolve, there exists a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that
may cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

The events or conditions are as follows:

  - As at the date of approval of these financial statements the Group has cash balances of £102 million. The
Group’s owner, Brookfield, has already provided £139 million of funds to ensure the liquidity of the Group.
Further committed funds of £21 million are approved for use if required and Brookfield have indicated that
additional funding could be made available should the need arise. However, as noted elsewhere, there
remains some uncertainty with regards forecasting both the pace of recovery and the eventual levels to
which trading will return and accordingly it is possible that further funding will be required that as at the date
of approval of these financial statements has not yet been secured.

  - Depending on how quickly the Group’s trading recovers or if there are further Government imposed
restrictions that result in the closure of one or more villages for a period of time, there is a risk that existing
financial covenants will be breached although the Directors have taken a number of actions to mitigate the
risk and as at the date of approval of these financial statements do not anticipate any breaches.

  - The Group has only recently recommenced operations, in line with UK Government advice. As at the current
date there remains a requirement to ensure certain social distancing measures are in place and certain
activities are not as yet able to operate. As a result, these measures may have a significant impact on the
format of the breaks in the near term. While there are indications of strong demand for the Group’s breaks
with bookings for the fourth quarter significantly ahead of the prior year, the ability to initially operate at the
previous high levels of occupancy will be restricted. While the fundamentals of the Group’s model remain
sound, the above factors naturally create challenges in the ability to accurately forecast the cash flows of the
Group.

The Directors have already taken a number of measures as described above to manage the Group’s liquidity
position. In the light of these material uncertainties and in the case where further funding was not forthcoming, the
Directors have a range of further measures which are within their control, to protect the Group’s liquidity position even
further, including:

  - Further encouragement for customers to change their break to a future date in the event of a cancellation of
their break rather than receiving a full refund.

  - Additional changes to working arrangements to reduce staff costs further.

  - Negotiations with HMRC for further delay of payroll and indirect tax payments.

  - A £90 million committed liquidity facility that remains undrawn. This is available to pay certain senior
expenses and Class A note interest.

The Directors believe the cash flow forecast outlined above is reasonable in light of the re-opening of the villages and
the current Government risk levels. However, COVID-19’s continued presence may see a change in Government
advice and/or further periods of lock down in the future. Such lock downs could result in further village closures on a
national or regional level or affect the ability of guests and employees to travel to site. These uncertainties clearly
introduce a level of subjectivity in assessing assumptions to be used in a downside case. However, the Directors
have prepared downside forecasts which assume the closure of one village for a period of eight weeks or two villages
for a period of four weeks.

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Going concern (continued)**

As with the base case scenario this downside case would not see the Group breach lending covenants or suffer a
liquidity shortage. However, were the Group to require access to further liquidity this could be sought from the
Group’s owner. The Directors believe that this support would be available and forthcoming for a number of reasons
including:

  - Previous actions and commitments in supporting the Group with £139 million already provided and a further
£21 million approved for use if required.

  - Center Parcs’ potential value to Brookfield is very significant and hence injection of further cash to protect
this value could reasonably be expected.

  - BSREP II is one of Brookfield Asset Management’s flagship funds which closed with total equity
commitments of $9 billion. BSREP II still has equity commitments available to satisfy any needed follow-on
capital calls from existing investments and expenses or other liabilities.

  - Brookfield have provided a letter of support to the Directors of the Group indicating their intention to provide
such funding in the event that it is required.

  - Three of the Group’s Directors are “Investor Directors” appointed by the Group’s owners. They are uniquely
placed to understand both the Group’s business and potential actions by the owners. They have indicated
that they believe it reasonable to believe support would be made available.

However, ultimately there is no guarantee that this support would be provided and as a consequence there exists a
material uncertainty that additional funding may not be available.

As a result of the options available to them the Directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial
statements on a going concern basis. However, the circumstances described above represent a material uncertainty
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, to continue
realising its assets and discharging its liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that would result from the basis of preparation being inappropriate.

**Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited (‘the
Company’) and entities controlled by the Company. A company controls another entity when it is exposed, or has
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with that entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over that entity.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of CPUK Finance Limited, a company set up with the
sole purpose of issuing debt secured on assets owned by the Group. The Directors of Center Parcs (Holdings 1)
Limited consider this company meets the definition of a structured entity under IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial
statements’ and hence for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements it has been treated as a subsidiary
undertaking. Details of this company are provided in note 28.

The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared for the same financial reporting period as the
Company.

The consolidated financial statements of Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited have been prepared under the principles
of predecessor accounting and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts. This accounting
treatment results in differences on consolidation between consideration and the fair value of underlying net assets
and this difference is included within equity as an other reserve.

On 11 June 2015 the Group acquired CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited; prior to that date both the Group
and CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited were under the common control of the parent company CP Cayman
Midco 1 Limited. The acquisition formed part of a group reconstruction and has been accounted for using merger
accounting principles which present the financial statements as if CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited had
always been part of the Group using the pre-combination carrying values.

Under merger accounting principles, the assets and liabilities of CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited have been
consolidated based on their pre-combination book values and the difference between the consideration payable and
the book values of the net assets is recorded in equity in the other reserve.

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)**

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**
The preparation of financial statements requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies

_Discount rate used to determine the value of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation (note 25):_
The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation is discounted at a rate set by reference to market yields at
the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Significant judgment is required when setting the
criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

_Useful economic lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets (notes 9/10):_
The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets at the end
of each reporting period. During the current period, the Directors have concluded that no revision is required to either
useful economic lives or residual values of these assets, and that residual values exceed carrying values.

_Impairment test for goodwill (note 8):_
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to
which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate future cash flows
expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.

**Revenue**
Revenue relates to accommodation rental income on holidays commenced during the period, together with other
related income that primarily arises from on-village leisure, retail and food and beverage spend. Revenue relating to
accommodation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the holiday. The performance obligation for
non-rental income, and hence the basis for revenue recognition, is when the related product or service is provided to
the guest. All revenue is recorded net of VAT.

Payment for accommodation rental income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded as
‘deferred income’ within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences. As such, no revenue was
recognised during the period the villages were closed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

A number of trading units on each holiday village are operated by concession partners. Revenue due in respect of
such units is recognised on an accruals basis. All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.

For disaggregation purposes, revenue as presented in note 2 is split between accommodation and on-site spend.

**Cost of sales**
Cost of sales comprise the cost of goods and services provided to guests. All costs to the point of sale, including
direct employee costs, are included within cost of sales. Depreciation and amortisation charges are not considered
part of cost of sales.

**Operating segments**
The operating segments set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements are consistent with the internal
reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. The Chief
Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.

**Exceptional/non-underlying items**
Exceptional/non-underlying items are defined as those that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency,
warrant separate disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the
Group. Non-underlying items are those that are not directly related to the ongoing trade of the business or that are
unrepresentative of ongoing performance. Examples of exceptional/non-underlying items are the costs of Group
restructures, expenses incurred when refinancing debt and movements in the fair value of embedded derivatives.

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Goodwill**
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is instead tested
for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is allocated to
cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.

**Other intangible assets**
_Software_
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the
specific software. These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are
generally considered to be either four or seven years.

Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the
Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as
intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of
relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated
useful lives.

_Other intangible assets_
Other purchased intangible assets are capitalised at cost, amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful
economic lives and tested for impairment annually. The brand is not amortised as it is considered to have an
indefinite life; the carrying value of the brand is subject to an annual impairment review.

**Impairment of assets**
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not
subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and whenever there is an indication at the end of a
reporting period that the asset may be impaired. Assets that are subject to depreciation and amortisation are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-inuse. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).

**Property, plant and equipment**
The Directors chose the cost basis under IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’, rather than to apply the alternative
(revaluation) treatment to all items of property, plant and equipment as its ongoing accounting policy. The cost of
property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable costs.

Depreciation is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment (except assets in the course of construction)
so as to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the
assets concerned, which are typically as follows:

Installations 10 to 20 years
Fixtures and fittings 5 to 10 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Computer hardware 4 years

Buildings are depreciated to residual value over 50 years. Land is not depreciated. The Group’s water boreholes are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over 13 years.

Useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and revised where expectations are
significantly different from previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for current and future periods
is adjusted accordingly.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the
cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other
borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the year in which they are incurred.

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)**

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Maintenance expenditure**
It is the policy of the Group to maintain its land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance expenditure
increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to generate, this expenditure is capitalised. All
other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

**Leases**
The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of a contract. The Group recognises a
right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee,
except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value
assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which
economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the
Group calculates an appropriate incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

  - Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives;

  - Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

  - The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

  - The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and

  - Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to
terminate the lease.

Lease liabilities are subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease
liabilities (using the effective interest rate method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments
made. The Group remeasures the lease liabilities (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use
assets) whenever:

  - The lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in
which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised
discount rate.

  - The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a
guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating
interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used).

  - A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which
case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount
rate.

The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made
at or before the commencement date and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which
it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a
provision is recognised and measured under IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’. The
costs are included in the related right-of-use asset.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a
lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects
to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset.
The deprecation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and
the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognised as an administrative expense in the consolidated
income statement in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 52 weeks ended 23 April 2020 (continued)**

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Investments in subsidiary undertakings**
Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment. If there are indications of impairment, an
assessment is made of the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement when the
recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. Dividends receivable from investments in subsidiary
undertakings are recognised in the income statement when approved by the shareholders of the company paying the
dividend.

**Current and deferred tax**
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. The current tax charge is calculated on the
basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount
expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed by
the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are defined
as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Such assets and liabilities
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither
the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax on properties assumes recovery through sale.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the assets can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the
related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Inventories**
The basis of valuation of inventories is the lower of cost on a first in first out basis and estimated net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable selling
expenses. Inventory provisions are created where necessary to ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of cost
and estimated net realisable value.

**Financial instruments**
The Group classifies its financial assets into two categories, being those measured at amortised cost and those
measured at fair value. Where assets are measured at fair value gains and losses are recognised either in the
income statement or in other comprehensive income, depending on the nature of the asset. Financial assets are
included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date which are
classified as non-current assets

Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial liabilities. The
classification depends on the nature of the financial instrument acquired. Other financial liabilities are carried at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Trade receivables**
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less any expected credit
losses.

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Cash and cash equivalents**
For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at
bank and cash in hand.

**Borrowings**
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**Borrowing costs**
Interest on borrowings is treated as an expense in the income statement, with the exception of interest costs incurred
on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.

**Early termination costs**
Costs associated with the early repayment of borrowings are written off to the income statement as incurred.

**Derivative financial instruments**
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments have historically been
used by the Group to manage its exposure to interest rates on long-term floating-rate borrowings. All derivative
financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value. The Group does not currently hedge
account for any derivatives. As such, any gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the income statement.

**Embedded derivatives**
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not
measured at fair value through profit and loss.

**Trade payables**
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**Provisions**
Provisions for legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where there are a
number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering
the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any
one item included in the same class of obligations is small.

**Dividend distribution**
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.

**Foreign currencies**
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the
rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.

**Employee benefits**
_Pensions_

- Defined contribution pension scheme

Group employees can choose to be a member of a defined contribution pension scheme. A defined contribution
pension scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The
Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to
pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions are
charged to the income statement as incurred.

- Defined benefit pension scheme

A funded senior management defined benefit pension scheme also exists. A defined benefit pension scheme is a
pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

The surplus or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together
with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates for
high-quality corporate bonds, which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Remeasurement gains and losses are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

_Profit-sharing and bonus plans_
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into
consideration the profit attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises
a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

_Holiday pay_
The Group recognises an appropriate liability for the cost of holiday entitlements not taken at the balance sheet date.

**Share capital**
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds.

**Other reserve**
The other reserve in the consolidated financial statements represents the differences on consolidation arising on the
adoption of predecessor accounting. This comprises the difference between consideration paid and the book value
of net assets acquired in the transaction.

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating
Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as
the Board of Directors.

The operating segments are the five holiday villages that the business operates. Central Services costs are centrally
managed administration costs. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s
accounting policies described in note 1.

The primary profit measure used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker is EBITDA before nonunderlying/exceptional items, being earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and
exceptional/non-underlying items. The internal reporting does not disaggregate the balance sheet to each operating
segment.

The split of revenue by business stream was £269.9 million (2019: £290.6 million) for accommodation and £173.8
million (2019: £189.6 million) for on-site spend.

###### 8. Goodwill

**Group**
**Cost and net book value** **£m**
At 23 April 2020, 25 April 2019 and 26 April 2018 **157.5**

**Impairment test for goodwill**
Goodwill relates to the acquisition of the Sherwood, Elveden, Longleat and Whinfell Villages only. It is allocated
equally to four cash-generating units (CGUs), being the four villages.

The Directors consider that the economic characteristics and future expectations are materially consistent across
each of the four villages.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash
flow projections based on financial forecasts prepared by management covering a rolling five-year period.

**Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations**

The value-in-use calculation is based on forecasts approved by the Board covering the next ten years with a terminal
value applied after year five. The cash flow assumptions in the calculation reflect the anticipated impact of the Covid19 pandemic, using the Directors’ base case scenario as discussed in note 1.

The key assumptions of the value-in-use calculation are Adjusted EBITDA margin, growth rates and the discount
rate; the long-term growth rate applied is 2.0% (2019: 2.0%) and the discount rate applied is 10.8% (2019: 8.7%).

Management determine forecast Adjusted EBITDA margins based on past performance and expectations of market
development. The growth rates used reflect management’s expectations of the future market. Discount rates used
are pre-tax and reflect the specific risks to the Group.

Based on the value-in-use calculations performed, the Directors have concluded that there is no impairment of
goodwill. The Directors have performed sensitivity analysis using the full range of reasonable assumptions and no
impairment triggers have been identified.

The Company has no goodwill.

Amounts owed to Group undertakings at 25 April 2019 represented an interest-free payable due to Center Parcs
(Operating Company) Limited. This was settled during the current period and further details are set out in note 26.

All amounts owed to related parties and Group undertakings at the current and prior period-end are unsecured and
repayable on demand.

Deferred income represents revenues received at the period end date that relate to future periods; the principal
component is accommodation income. Deferred income principally relates to bookings for holidays in the 12 months
immediately following the balance sheet date; approximately 1% of bookings relate to the subsequent year.

As at 23 April 2020 all breaks with guest departure dates up to and including 13 May 2020 had been cancelled, as a
result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and therefore amounts owed to guests in respect of those breaks has been
presented as other financial liabilities. The re-opening date for the UK villages was subsequently postponed until 13
July 2020 and hence a proportion of liabilities categorised as deferred income in the above table were ultimately
reclassified to other financial liabilities and refunded to guests.

_Mortgage_

The Group has a mortgage secured over its head office which incurs interest at LIBOR plus 1.125% and matures in
November 2020. Annual repayments on this mortgage total £267,000. A one percentage point movement in interest
rates would affect this interest charge by approximately £1,000 (2019: £4,000).

_Secured debt_

All assets of the Group are pledged as security under a whole business securitisation debt structure.

The secured debt consists of the following:

**2020** 2019

The accounting policies for financial instruments have been applied to the items below. As at 23 April 2020 and 25
April 2019 all of the Group’s financial assets were classified as those measured at amortised cost and all of the
Group’s financial liabilities were categorised as other financial liabilities.

The only financial instruments held by the Company are other payables of £nil (2019: £110.9 million) which are
categorised as other financial liabilities.

**Fair value hierarchy**
IFRS 13 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value
hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

All of the Group’s secured borrowings have been categorised as Level 1 (2019: Level 1) and fair values have been
derived from unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets.

###### 17. Financial instruments (continued)

**Financial risk management**
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity and borrowings as required. The Group has sought to
reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Group’s funding using the underlying asset value. All
tranches of the Group’s secured debt are subject to financial covenants. The Directors have assessed future
compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial covenants. The overall policy in respect of
interest rates is to reduce the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and the Group’s primary source of
borrowings is fixed interest rate loan notes. The Group does not actively trade in derivative financial instruments.

**Interest rate risk**
As at 23 April 2020 and 25 April 2019 the Group had fixed rate loan notes and a floating rate mortgage as its only
external funding sources.

**Liquidity risk**
As at 23 April 2020, the Group held sufficient levels of cash and committed funding to enable it to meet its mediumterm working capital, lease liability and funding obligations. Rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements are
prepared and monitored, and surplus cash is invested in interest bearing accounts.

**Currency risk**
The Group is exposed to limited currency risk through foreign currency transactions. The Group does not operate a
hedging facility to manage currency risk as it is considered to be insignificant.

**Credit risk**
The Group borrows from well-established institutions with high credit ratings. The Group’s cash balances are held on
deposit with a number of UK banking institutions.

###### 25. Pension commitments

**Defined contribution pension scheme**

The Group participates in the Center Parcs pension scheme, which is a defined contribution pension scheme with a
contributory and a non-contributory membership level. Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme for the

Accruals per note 12 include £0.5 million (2019: £0.5 million) in respect of defined contribution pension scheme costs.

**Defined benefit pension scheme**

The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme for certain employees. Contributions are determined
by an independent qualified actuary using assumptions on the rate of return on investments and rates of increases in
salaries and benefits.

The last available actuarial valuation of the scheme at the balance sheet date was that performed as at 31 July 2017.
This was updated to 23 April 2020 by a qualified independent actuary.

The impact of guaranteed minimum pensions (“GMP”) equalisation is expected to be less than £0.1 million.

###### Center Pares {Holdings 1) Limited

 Strategic report For the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2019 (continued)

 Prlnclpal risks and uncertainties [(]continued[) ]

**_Contrectual arrangements_**
###### The Group has contracts with third parties for the supply of goods and aervlces. Contracts are negotiated at arms' length and the Group does not enter Into contracts that are outside the ordinary course of bu81n888 or thoae that contain onerous terms. The Group ado[pts ]a compliance [pro]gramme to ensure that It Is compliant with its material contractual commitments. There Is no single contractual counterpa[rty ]that Is criUcal to the running of the busln888. The fallure of any crttlcal contractual counterpa[rty ]Is managed through supply chain contingency arrangements [(]see Supply chain[)].

 Employees The Group's performance largely depends on lta managers and staff, both on the villages and at head office. The reslgnaUon of key lndlvlduals or the lnablllty to recruit staff with the right experience and skllls could adverse[ly ]Impact the Group's results. To mitigate these issues the Group has invested In training programmes for its staff and has a number of bonus schemas linked to the Group's results and achievement against key performance Indicators linked to guest satisfaction that are designed to reward and retain key Individuals.

**_Input price lf1Cf88888_**
###### The Group's margin can be adversely affected by an increase in the price of key costs to the business including, but not limited to, wages, overheads and utilities. The Group takes proaCUve steps to manage any such lncreaHS Including coat control, forward buying and budgeting for any lncn3ase.

**_Brand_**
###### The Center Pares brand could be adverael[y ]affected by a serious incident, accident or slmllar occurrence or [J]ust a slow decline In the brand's appeal to consumers. The Group mitigates the risk of a serious incident, accident or simllar occul18nce by maintaining lndu[stry-]leadlng health and [safety ]ayetems and standards of training. The risk of a slow decline In the brand's appeal Is managed through continuous product Innovation, marketing campaigns and brand develo[p]ment

**_Fraud_**
###### The Group operates five sites across the United Kingdom. Risk of fraud exists In misappropriation of assets, lncludlng banking, theft of stock and theft of cash takings. The Grou[p ]mitigates this risk thro[ug]h the management structure and regular financial review with, and extensive use of, business systems. In addition, the Group's internal audit function undertakes regular reviews of flnanclal controls with particular focus on cash and stock transactions. The Group la also sub[j]ect to regular external audits.

 Market risk factors

**_General Economic conditions_**
###### The dis[posa]ble Income of the Group's guests and/or their hollday preferences are and will be affected by changes In the general economic environment and this may result In a fall In the number of guests and/or a decrease In on-site expenditure. The Group regula[rly ]reviews Its product offering and engages with guests to ensure It provides value for money to meet guest needs.

 Brexlt Followlng the result of the •erexir Referendum on 23 June 2016, there remains a large degree of uncertainty regarding what the legal, economic, polltlcal and trading relatlonshlp will be between the United Kingdom and the member states of the European Union and other sovereign states. Untll the terms of •erextr have bean finalised, it is dlfflcult for businesses to predict the impact it wlll have on them and their flnanclal performance. Thus far, the referendum result has not had a material Impact on the business of the Group.

**_Competition_**
###### The Center Pares brand la synonymous with high quality short breaks In a forest environment but the Group competes for the discretionary expenditure of potential guests, who could choose to take short breaks at other desUnatlons or participate In other recreational actlvlUes. The Dlrectora balleve that this risk is mitigated by the strength of the Center Pares brand and the continual Investment In the accommodation and central facllltles (lncludlng retall and restaurants), coupled with the innovation amongst the leisure activities and the responsiveness to guest surveys.

 Strategic report For the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2019 (continued)

 Prtnclpal rtea and uncertalntl•• (continued)

**_Seaaonallty and weather_**
###### Demand for ehort breaks Is Influenced by the main hofiday periods at Entar, the Summer holidays and the ChrtstmaafNew year pertod. Thie rtek is mitigated by online dynamic prtclng which encourages demand outalde of the peak periods. The accommodation Is located within forest environments and a significant number of activities take place outdoors. Therefore, demand may be lmpactsd by the prevailing weather. This risk Is minimal becauae guests tend not to book on lmpulaa and the vast majortty of breaks and activities are booked in advance. Additionally, the Group maintains diversity between lta Indoor and outdoor activities to mitigate this rtak.

 Ananclaj risks The Directors and senior managers regularty review the flnanclal requirements of the Group and the 8880clated risks. The Group does not uaa complicated financial Instruments and where tlnancial Instruments are used they are used to reduce Interest rate risk. The Group does not hold tlnancial lnstn.ments for trading purposaa. The Group finances Its operations and developments through a mixture of retained eamlnga and borrowings as required. Hlatorlcally, the Group has sought to reduce Its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Group funding using the undertylng asNt value.

 All tranches of the Group's secured debt are subject to financial covenants. The Directors have asseued future compllance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial covenants.

**_Interest rate risk_**
###### Principal aources of borrowings are fixed Interest rate loan notes.

_LJquldlty risk_
###### The Group maintains sufficient levels of cash to enable It to meet Its medium-term working capital, lease llability and funding obllgations. Rolling forecasts of 1/quidlty requirements are prepared and monitored, and surplue cash le
**Invested In lntereet heart� accounts.**

**_Currency rillk_**
###### Whilst no borrowings are denominated In foreign cun8ncies, a number of suppliers are exposed to the Euro and US Dollar. Acconlngly, wherever poalble the Group enters Into supply contracts denominated In Sterling. The Group does not operate a hedging faclfity to manage cun8ncy rfsk as it Is not considered to be material.

**_Credit risk_**
###### The Group's caeh balances are held on deposit with a number of UK banking Institutions. Credit risk In respect of the Group'• revenue streams la limited ea the vast majority of customers pay In advance.

 Flnanc/81 reporting risk The Group's financial systems are required to proce11 a large number of transactions securely and accurately; any weaknesses In the systems could result In the incorrect reporting of financial results and covenant compliance. This risk Is mitigated by the production of detailed management accounts which are regularly compered to budgets and forecasts. The Group 18 also subject to an annual external audit

**registered In England and Wales. The address of its registered office Is One Edleon Rise, New Ollerton, Newark,**
**Nottinghamshire, NG22 90P.**

**Bal• of preparation**
**These consolidated flnanclal statements for the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2019 (2018: 53 weeks ended 26 Aprll 2018)**
**have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and lntamatlonal Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee**
**(IFRIC) and Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) Interpretations adopted by the European Union and wtth thoee**
**parts of the Companies Act 2006 appllcable to companies reporting under IFRS. The flnanclal statements have bean**
**prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments and**
**retirement benefit obligations. All accounting policlas disclosed have been applied conslatently** to **both periods**
**presented, with the exception of those relating to flnanclal Instruments, revenue and lease accounting following the**
**adoption of IFRS 9 'Flnanclal Instruments', IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' and IFRS 18 'Leases'**
**in the period anded 25 April 2019.**

**Toe accounting reference date of Canter Paree (Holdlngs 1) Limited Is 22 April.**

**Genera/ impact of the application of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'**
**The adoption of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', replacing IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and**
**Measurement', has not had a material Impact on the Group'& financial statements. There have been no changes to**
**the aneta and llablilHes considered to be ftnanclal Instruments, although IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' d088 amend**
**the categorisation of financial assets and liabilities. This change has been reflected In both the flnanclal instruments**
**accounting policy and the disclosures in note 17.**

**IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' Introduces an expacted credit loss modal which requires the Group to consider the**
**recoverability of its financial assets and** to recognise any anticipated losses as an Impairment. In 188pect of trade
**racelvablas, credit risk is limited as the vast majority of customers pay In advance. Credit risk la also considered to**
**be low In respect of the Group's cash and cash equivalents, given the credit ratings of the counterpertias. As such,**
**no expected credit 108888 have bean recognised following the adoption of IFRS 9 'Flnanclal Instruments'.**

**IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' also Introduces new requirements for hedge accounting but thasa are not currently**
**relevant to the Group.**

**Addltlonally, the Group has adopted consequentlal amendments to IAS 7 'Statement of Cash Flows' that have been**
**applied to the current and prior period.**

**_General Impact of the application of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'_**
**The adoption of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers', replacing IAS 18 'Revenue', has not had a**
**material impact on the Group's financial statements. The Group has adopted IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with**
**Customers' using the retrospective method (without pradlcal expedients) and as such has recognised the cumulative**
**affect of applying the new standard at the start of the earliest period presented. The affect of the adoption of IFRS 15**
**'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' as at 20 April 2017 was the def'enal of £0.8m of revenue in respect of**
**certain promotional activities. As such, £0.8m was recognised as a liability at the transition date with a corresponding**
**reduction to retained earnings. The timing of the recognition of all other revenue Is unchanged.**

###### Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weak.a ended 25 Aprll 2019 (continued)

 1. Accounting policies (continued)

 Genera/ impact of the appllcatlon of IFRS 16 'Leases' In the current period, the Group, for the first time, has applied IFRS 16 'Leases' (as Issued by the IASB In January 2016) in advance of Its effective date.

 IFRS 16 'Leases' introduces new or amended requirements with respect to lease accounting. It Introduces significant changes to lesaee accounting by removing the distinction between operating and finance leases and requiring the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liablllty at the lease commencement date for all leases, except for short-tann leases and 188888 of low value assets.

 The Group has applied IFRS 16 'Leases' using the modified retrospective approach and therefore the comparative lnfonnation has not bean restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 'Leases'. The details of accounting under IAS 17 'Leases' are disclosed separately and the Impact of the changes Is dlscloaed In note 2.

 Impact of the new definition of s lease The Group has made use of the practical expedient available on transition to IFRS 18 'Leases' not to reassess whether a contract Is or contains a lease. Accordingly, the definition of a lease In accordance with IAS 17 'Leases' and IFRIC 4 'Determining Whether An Agreement Contains a Lease' wlll continue to be applied to leases entered Into or modified before 27 April 2018.

 The change in definition of a lease principally relates to the concept of control. IFRS 18 'Leases' detennines whether a contract contains a lease on the basis of whether the customer has the right to control the use of an Identified asset for a period of time In exchange for consideration.

 The Group applies the definition of a lease and relatad related guidance set out in IFRS 18 'Leases' to all lease contracts entered into or modified on or after 27 April 2018. In preparation for the first-time adoption of IFRS 16 'Leases' the Group carried out an implementation project which showed that the new definition In IFRS 18 'Leases' wlll not significantly change the scope of contracts that meet the definlUon of a lease for the Group.

 Impact on L88SH Accounting IFRS 18 'Leases' changes how the Group accounts for leases previously classlfled as operating leases under IAS 17 'Leases', which were off-balance sheet. Applying IFRS 18 'Leases' the Group:
 a) Recognises right-of-use aaets and lease liabllltles In the consolidated balance sheet. lnltlally measured at the present value of future lease payments; b) Recognises depreciation of right-to-use assets and interest on lease llabllltles In the consolldated Income statement; and c) Separates the total amount of cash paid into a principal portion and Interest In the consolidated cash flow statement (both presented within financing activities).

 Under IFRS 18 'Leases', right-of-use a88eta ara tested for impalnnent in accordance with IAS36 'Impairment of Assets'. This replaces the previous requirement to recognise a provision for onerous leaaa contracts. For short-tenn leaaas (lease tenns of 12 months or lass) and leases of low-value a888ts, the Group has opted to recognise a lease expense on a straight-fine basis as permitted by IFRS 16 'Leases'.

 Going concern The Directors have asaeased the financial positions of the Group and the Company In llght of the net current llabllitiea positions at the end of the period. In aaaeaalng the going concern of the buslneaa they have considered the projected Mure trading and cash flows of the business. Using the evidence available to them they have concluded that It Is appropriate to present the financlal statements on a going concern basis, as they consider that the Group wlll continua as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the flnanclal statements.

###### The consolidated financial statements incorporete the financial statements of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited fthe Company') and entitles controlled by the Company. A company controls another entity when It Is exposed, or has rights, to varlable returns from Its Involvement with that entity and has the ablllty to affect those returns through Its power over that entity.

 The consolldated financial statements Incorporate the rasults of CPUK Finance Limited, a company set up with the sole purpose of IBSulng debt aecured on assets owned by the Group. The Dlrecto111 of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited consider this company meets the definition of a structured entity under IFRS 10 'Consolldated financial atatements' and hence for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements it has bean treated as a subsidiary undertaking. Details of this company are provided in note 28.

 The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared for the same flnanclal reporting period as the Company.

 The consolidated flnanclal statements of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited have been prepared under the prlnciplas of predaC8880r accounting and all entitles are Included at their pre-combination canylng amounts. This accounting treatment results In differences on consolidation between consideration and the fair value of underlying net assets and this difference is included within equity as an other reserve.

 On 11 June 2015 the Group acquired CP Wobum (Operating Company) Limited; prior to that data both the Group and CP Wobum (Operating Company) Limited were under the common control of the paT9nt company CP Cayman Mldco 1 Limited. The acquisition formed part of a group reconstruction and has been accounted for using merger accounUng prlnclples which preaent the flnanclal statements as If CP Wobum (Operating Company) Limited had always bean part of the Group using the pre-combination canylng values.

 Under merger accounting prlnclplas, the assets and llablllUas of CP Wobum (Operating Company) Limited have bean consolldatad based on their pre-combination book values and the difference between the consideration payable and the book values of the net assets Is recorded In equity In the other reserve.

 1. Accounting pollclea (continued)

**Critical accounting Judgements and key aoul'C88 of e1tlmatlon uncertainty**
**The preparation of financial statements requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affact the**
**applicatlon of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on**
**hlatorical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable**
**under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.**

**Crltlcal j[ud]gements [in ]applyjnq the Group's accountjng pollcies**

###### Discount rate used to determine the carrying value of the Group's defined benem pension scheme obligation:
**The Group's defined benefit pension scheme obligation is discounted at a rate set by reference to market ylelds at**
**the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Significant Judgment Is required when setting the**
**criteria for bonds to be Included In the populatlon from which the yleld curve Is derived.**

**Key sources of estjmallon uncertainty**

###### Useful economic llvN and residual values of property, plant and equipment and other Intangible assets:
**The Group reviews the estimated useful llves of property, plant and equipment and other lntanglble assets at the end**
**of each reporting period. During the currant period, the Directors have concluded that no revision Is required to either**
**useful economic fives or residual values of th898 a888ts.**

###### Impairment test for goodwill:
**Determining whether goodwill Is Impaired requires an estimation of the value In use of the cash-generating units to**
**which goodwlll has been allocated. The value In use calculation requires the Group to estimate future cash flows**
**expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.**

###### Determination of the appropriate rate to discount /ease payments:
**Where discount rates lmpllclt in leases cannot be readily determined, the Group Is required to calculate appropriate**
**Incremental borrowing rates in order to establlsh the values of lease llabllities and associated right-of-use asse1B.**
**This process Incorporates a number of estimates and assumptions, lncludlng property ylelds and borrowing rates.**

**Revenue**
**Revenue relates to accommodation rental Income on holldays commenced during the period, together with other**
**related Income that primarily arises from on-village lelsure, retail and food and beverage spend. Revenue relating to**
**accommodation Is recognised on a stralght-llne basis over the period of the holiday. The perfonnance obllgatlon for**
**non-rental Income, and hence the basis for revenue recognition, is when the related produd or service is provided to**
**the guest. All revenue Is recorded net of VAT.**

**Payment for accommodation rental Income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and Is recorded as**
**'deferred Income' within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences. A number of trading units on each**
**holiday village are operated by conceBSlon partnen1. Revenue due in reaped of such units Is recognised on an**
**accruals basis. All revenue arises In the United Kingdom.**

**For disaggregation purposes, revenue as presented In note 3 Is spilt between accommodation and on-afte spend.**

**Coat of NIN**
**Cost of sales comprise the cost of goods and services provided to guests. All costs to the point of sale, includlng**
**dlred employee costs, are included within coat of sales.**

**Operating Hgmentl**
**The operating segments sat out In note 3 to the consolldated financial statements are consistent with the Internal**
**reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 'Operating Segments'. The Chief**
**Operating Decision Maker has been Identified as the Board of Directors.**

**Exceptlonal/non-undarlylng ltams**
**Exceptional/non-underlying Items are defined as those that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency,**
**warrant separate dlsclosure in the financial statements In order to fully understand the underlying performance of the**
**Group. Non-underlying items are those that are not dlrectly related to the ongoing trade of the business or that are**
**unrepresentative of ongoing performance. Examples of exceptlonal/non-underlylng items are the costs of Group**

**Goodwlll**
###### Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and llabllities acquired. Goodwill ls not amortised but is Instead tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently If events or changes In circumstances Indicate that the carrying value may be Impaired. Any Impairment Is recognised lmmedletaly In the Income statement. Goodwlll Is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.

other lntanglble alet:I
###### Software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are generally considered to be either four or seven years.

 Costs that are dlrectly aSS0clated with the production of ldentlflable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as Intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assats are amortised over their estimated useful lives.

**_Other Intangible assets_**
###### Other purchased Intangible assets are capltallsed at cost, amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives and tested for Impairment annually. The brand Is not amortised as It Is considered to have an Indefinite life; the carrying value of the brand is subject to an annual impairment review.

 Impairment of aaeta Assets that have an Indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for Impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for Impairment whenever events or changes In circumstances Indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An Impairment loss Is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds Its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an assefs fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately ldentlflable cash flows {cash-generating units).

 Property, plant and equipment The Directors chose the cost basis under IAS 16 'Property, plant and equipment', rather than to apply the alternative {revaluation) treatment to all Items of property, plant and equipment as Its ongoing accounting policy. The cost of property, plant and equipment Includes directly attributable costs. The Group elected to apply the optional exemption of IFRS 1 'First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards' and, as such, the carrying value of properties that were previously held at fair value was treated as deemed cost at the date of adoption of IFRS.

 Depreciation Is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment (except assets In the course of construction) so as to write off the cost, 1888 residual value, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned, which are typically as follows:

 Installations 1 O to 20 years Fixturea and fittings 5 to 10 years Motor vehicles 4years Computer hardware 4years

 Buildings are depreciated to reaidual value over 50 years. Land is not depreciated. The Group's water boreholes are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 13 years.

 Useful llves and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and revised where expectations are slgnlflcantly dlfrarent from previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for current and future periods Is adjusted accordingly.

 Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get reedy for their Intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their Intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised In the Income statement In the year In which they are Incurred.

**Maintenance expendltul"B**
###### It is the pollcy of the Group to maintain Its land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance expenditure Increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment la expected to generate, this expenditure is capitalised. All other maintenance coats are charged to the Income statement as Incurred.

**_Polley appllcable from 27 April 2018_**
###### The Group asaesaea whether a contract la or contains a lease at Inception of a contract. The Group recognl888 a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease llabllity with respect to all lease agreements in which it Is the lessee, except for short-tenn leases (defined as leases with a lease tenn of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the tenn of the lease unless another systematic basis Is more representative of the time pattern In which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

 The lease llablllty Is lnltlally measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate lmpliclt In the lease. If this rate cannot be readily detennlned, the Group calculates an appropriate Incremental borrowing rate.

 Lease payments Included In the measurement of the lease llablllty comprise:

 • Fixed lease payments (including In-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives;
 • Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, lnltlally measured using the Index or rate at the commencement date;
 • The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;
 • The exercise price of purchase options, If the lessee Is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and
 • Payments of penalties for tenninatlng the lease, If the lease tenn reflects the exercise of an option to tennlnate the lease.

 Lease llablfltles are subsequently measured by Increasing the carrying amount to reflect Interest on the lease llabHlties (using the effective interest rate method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. The Group reme88llres the lease liabilities {and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use assets) whenever:
 • The lease term has changed or there Is a change In the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, In which case the lease liablllty la remeasured by dlacounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.
 • The lease payments change due to changes In an Index or rate or a change In expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, In which cases the lease llability Is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the Initial discount rate (unless the leaae payments change la due to a change in a floating Interest rate, In which case a revised discount rate is used).
 • A lease contract Is modified and the lease modification Is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which caae the lease llabllity Is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

 The right-of-use assets comprise the lnltlal measurement of the corresponding lease llabillty, lease payments made at or before the commencement date and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and lmpalnnent losses.

 Whenever the Group Incurs an obllgaUon for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset. restore the site on which It Is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the tenna and conditions of the lease, a provision la recognised and measured under IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'. The costs are Included In the related right-of-use asset.

 Rlght-of-uee assets are depreciated over the shorter period of leaae tenn and ueeful llfe of the underlying asset. If a lease transfera ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset Is depreciated over the useful llfe of the underlying asset. The deprecation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

 Variable rents that do not depend on an Index or rate are not Included In the measurement of the lease llablHty and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognised as an administrative expense in the conaolldated income statement In the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.

**_Polley appllcable prior to 27 Aprll 2018_**
###### Leaaes were cla88lfled as finance leases If the tenns of the lease transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases were classified as operating lea88s.

 Assets held under finance leases were capltallaecl at cost and depreciated over their useful llves. The capital element of future rentals was treated as a liability and the interest element was charged to the Income statement over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital outstanding.

 Rental payments on operating leases (net of any Incentives received from the l8880r and lncludlng minimum contractual rental Increases) were charged to the Income statement on a straight-line basis.

**lnvestmente In IUblldlary undertaking,**

###### Investments are stated at cost, 1888 any provision for pennanent diminution In value. If there are Indications of lmpalnnent, an asaeument Is made of the recoverable amounl An impairment loss is recognlaecl In the Income statement when the recoverable amount Is lower than the canylng value. Dividends receivable from Investments In subsidiary undertakings are recognised in the income statement when approved by the shareholders of the company paying the dividend.

 Current and deferred tax The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enactad or substantlvely enacted at the balance sheet date and le measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorttles.

 Deferred tax Is provided In full, using the llablllty method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax In the Mure. Differences are defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and llabllltles and their tax baae. Such asaets and llabllltles are not recognised If the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the lnlllal recognition (other than In a busln888 combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profll Deferred tax on properties a88umes recovery through sale.

 Deferred tax assets are recogniaecl to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits wlll be available against which the 888ets can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset Is reallsed or the deferred tax llablllty Is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantlvely enacted at the balance sheet date.

Where assets are measured at fair value gains and losses are recognised either In the income statement or In other comprehensive Income, depending on the nature of the asset. Flnanclal assets are Included In current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets

Management determines the classification of its financial Instruments at lnltlal recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each reporting date. Other flnanclal llabllltles are canted at amortlaecl cost using the effective Interest rate method.

 Strategic report For the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018

The Directors present their Strategic report on the Group for the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (2017: 52 weeks
ended 20 April 2017).

**Review of the Business**
The principal activity of the Group is the operation of short break holiday villages, and the Center Pares business
operates five holiday villages in the United Kingdom, at Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, Elveden Forest in
Suffolk, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Whinfell Forest in Cumbria and Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire.

Center Pares targets the premium sector of the UK family short break market, offering an escape from the stresses
and strains of modem life and helping families come together.

With recent trends showing an increase in family short breaks, particularly in the UK, the Center Pares concept is
more relevant today than at any point in its history in the UK market. Center Pares continually invests heavily to
ensure that we deliver high quality service, accommodation and facilities, combined with an unrivalled array of
activities that cater for the most discerning of families, as well as the most changeable of British weather. There is
nothing prescriptive about a short break at Center Pares, with each family free to choose to do as little or as much as
they wish. Center Pares remains a unique proposition for families in the UK market and proves more popular every
year with a long-standing run of growth in terms of visitor numbers, revenue and EBITDA, as well as enviable guest
feedback scores and consistently high levels of returning guests.

Each of the Group's holiday villages is set in a forest environment amongst approximately 400 acres of forest and
lakes and is open 365 days per year. Woodland, water and a natural environment are the essential elements of a
Center Pares break. Within the comfortable, quiet and family-friendly setting, the Center Pares villages provide
guests with high-quality accommodation and more than 150 leisure and spa activities. There are over 4,200 units of
accommodation across the five villages. The focal point and key attraction of each village is an all-weather indoor
sub-tropical swimming paradise, featuring a selection of water activities including a wave pool, river slides and rides,
children's pools and jacuzzis. Other on-site experiences include outdoor activities such as cycling, boating and
quadbikes; indoor activities such as ten-pin bowling, badminton ana pottery; anu leisure amenities such as spas,
dining and retail.

_Financial performance_

The results of the Group for the period show a profit after taxation of £51.5 million (2017: profit of £63.8 million).
Adjusted EBITDA, being earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional/non-underlying
items was £228.4 million (2017: £213.0 million).

The heavy snowfall in England in March 2018 caused the temporary closure of Longleat Forest and restricted guest
arrivals and activities at all other villages. Guests impacted by the snow were issued refunds of both their
accommodation and on-site spend. This was only the fourth time that a village has had to close in over 30 years of
trading. The Directors estimate that the lost revenue totalled £1.6 million and the overall reduction in EBITDA for the
53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 was approximately £1.5 million. As such, had the heavy snowfall not occurred,
Adjusted EBITDA would have been £229.9 million.

During the period the Group incurred an exceptional/non-underlying finance cost of £26.9 million in respect of a
refinancing of the Group's debt. The Group also incurred exceptional/non-underlying administrative expenses of £2.3
million (2017: £nil), representing £1.6 million of costs relating to legal claims and associated settlements and £0.7
million of _one-off restructuring and reorganisation costs. Taxation on these expenses has also been treated as an_
exceptional/non-underlying item, as has a credit of £1.9 million in respect of a one-off group relief adjustment.

On 15 June 2017 the Group issued £100.0 million of additional A4 secured notes, together with £730.0 million of New
Class B notes, divided into £480.0 million 4.250% notes due to expire in August 2022 and £250.0 million 4.875%
notes due to mature in August 2025. Part of the proceeds of these new notes were used to settle the Group's Class
82 notes, which were due to mature in August 2020.

During the prior period ending 20 April 2017, the Group incurred an exceptional/non-underlying finance expense of
£5.2 million in respect of the anticipated refinancing of the Group's debt. Taxation on this expense was also treated
as an exceptional/non-underlying item, as was the impact of the change in applicable deferred tax rate from 18% to
17%.

 Strategic report For the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)

**Key performance indicators**
The Directors use the following key performance indicators to set targets and measure performance:

          - Revenue: Revenue for the period was £469.0 million (2017: £440.3 million).

          - Adjusted EBITDA: Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional/non­
underlying items. Adjusted EBITDA for the period was £228.4 million (2017: £213.0 million).

          - Occupancy: the average number of units of accommodation occupied as a percentage of the total number
available. Occupancy for the period was 97.6% (2017: 97.3%).

          - ADR (Average Daily Rate): the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total accommodation
income divided by the total number of lodge nights sold. ADR for the period was £184.95 (2017: £178.60).

          - RevPAL (Rent per available lodge night): the average daily rent (excluding VAT) achieved based on total
accommodation income divided by the total available number of lodge nights. RevPAL for the period was
£180.46 (2017: £173.80).

**Going concern**
The Directors have assessed the financial positions of the Group and the Company based upon the net current
liabilities positions at the end of the period. In assessing the going concern of the business they have considered the
projected future trading and cash flows of the business. Using the evidence available to them they have concluded
that it is appropriate to present the financial statements on a going concern basis, as they consider that the Group will
continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements.

Principal **risks and uncertainties**
The Directors and senior managers adopt a proactive approach to the management of potential risks and
uncertainties which could have a material impact on the performance of the business and execution of its growth
strategy, and are actively involved in the Group's Risk Committee. In addition to ongoing monitoring, this Risk
Committee meets quarterly to oversee risk management arrangements and ensure appropriate processes are put in
place to mitigate potential risks and uncertainties. The Fire, Health and Safety Steering Committee also meets bi­
monthly to oversee operational risks.

There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the Group's
performance and execution of its growth strategy. These risks include, but are not limited to:

Operational risk factors

_Health and safety_
The health, safety and welfare of the Group's guests and employees are central to its operations. The Group is
committed to maintaining industry leading standards in health and safety including fire and food safety and adopts a
proactive approach to its safety management. All incidents are recorded and reviewed to monitor trends and capture
learning points that are then integrated into the business. The Fire, Health and Safety Steering Committee reviews
major incidents and is focused on continuous improvement to mitigate the risk.

_Business continuity_
The Group operates five holiday villages in the United Kingdom and a significant interruption of any one would have a
material impact on the Group. As a result, the Risk Committee supervises comprehensive risk management
arrangements including business continuity plans which are regularly tested with the support of external specialists.
These arrangements are supported by a broad insurance programme.

_Supply chain_
The Group has a large number of suppliers and prides itself on the quality of its product. The Group could be
adversely affected by a fall in the standard of goods or services supplied by third parties or by a failure of a key
partner. Quality risks are mitigated via a robust supplier registration system with food and safety further supported by
independent advisors. In addition, the Risk Committee considers supply chain contingency arrangements and takes
appropriate measures to mitigate this risk.

###### Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited

 Strategic report For the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)

**Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)**

_Contractual arrangements_
The Group has contracts with third parties for the supply of goods and services. Contracts are negotiated at arms'
length and the Group does not enter into contracts that are outside the ordinary course of business or those that
contain onerous terms. The Group adopts a compliance programme to ensure that it is compliant with its material
contractual commitments. There is no single contractual counterparty that is critical to the running of the business.
The failure of any critical contractual counterparty is managed through supply chain contingency arrangements (see
Supply chain).

_Employees_
The Group's performance largely depends on its managers and staff, both on the villages and at head office. The
resignation of key individuals or the inability to recruit staff with the right experience and skills could adversely impact
the Group's results. To mitigate these issues the Group has invested in training programmes for its staff and has a
number of bonus schemes linked to the Group's results and achievement against key performance indicators linked
to guest satisfaction that are designed to reward and retain key individuals.

_Input price increases_
The Group's margin can be adversely affected by an increase in the price of key costs to the business including, but
not limited to, wages, overheads and utilities. The Group takes proactive steps to manage any such increases
including cost control, forward buying and budgeting for any increase.

_Brand_
The Center Pares brand could be adversely affected by a serious incident, accident or similar occurrence or just a
slow decline in the brand's appeal to consumers. The Group mitigates the risk of a serious incident, accident or
similar occurrence by maintaining industry-leading health and safety systems and standards of training. The risk of a
slow decline in the brand's appeal is managed through continuous product innovation, marketing campaigns and
brand development.

_Fraud_
The Group operates five sites across the United Kingdom. Risk of fraud exists in misappropriation of assets,
including banking, theft of stock and theft of cash takings. The Group mitigates this risk through the management
structure and regular financial review with, and extensive use of, business systems. In addition, the Group's internal
audit function undertakes regular reviews of financial controls with particular focus on cash and stock transactions.
The Group is also subject to regular external audits.

Market risk factors

_General Economic conditions_
The disposable income of the Group's guests and/or their holiday preferences are and will be affected by changes in
the general economic environment and this may result in a fall in the number of guests and/or a decrease in on-site
expenditure. The Group regularly reviews its product offering and engages with guests to ensure it provides value for
money to meet guest needs.

_Brexit_
Following the result of the "Brexit" Referendum on 23 June 2016, there remains a large degree of uncertainty
regarding what the legal, economic, political and trading relationship will be between the United Kingdom and the
member states of the European Union and other sovereign states. Until the terms of "Brexit" have been finalised, it is
difficult for businesses to predict the impact it will have on them and their financial performance. Thus far, the
referendum result has not had a material impact on the business of the Group.

_Competition_
The Center Pares brand is synonymous with high quality short breaks in a forest environment but the Group
competes for the discretionary expenditure of potential guests, who could choose to take short breaks at other
destinations or participate in other recreational activities. The Directors believe that this risk is mitigated by the
strength of the Center Pares brand and the continual investment in the accommodation and central facilities
(including retail and restaurants), coupled with the innovation amongst the leisure activities and the responsiveness
to guest surveys.


-----

###### Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited

 Strategic report For the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)

**Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)**

_Seasonality and weather_
Demand for short breaks is influenced by the main holiday periods at Easter, the Summer holidays and the
Christmas/New year period. This risk is mitigated by online dynamic pricing which encourages demand outside of
the peak periods. The accommodation is located within forest environments and a significant number of activities
take place outdoors. Therefore, demand may be impacted by the prevailing weather. This risk is minimal because
guests tend not to book on impulse and the vast majority of breaks and activities are booked in advance.
Additionally, the Group maintains diversity between its indoor and outdoor activities to mitigate this risk.

Financial risks
The Directors and senior managers regularly review the financial requirements of the Group and the associated risks.
The Group does not use complicated financial instruments and where financial instruments are used they are used to
reduce interest rate risk. The Group does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. The Group finances its
operations and developments through a mixture of retained earnings and borrowings as required. Historically, the
Group has sought to reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Group funding using the underlying
asset value.

All tranches of the Group's secured debt are subject to financial covenants. The Directors have assessed future
compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial covenants.

_Interest rate risk_
Principal sources of borrowings are fixed interest rate loan notes.

_Liquidity risk_
The Group maintains sufficient levels of cash to enable it to meet its medium-term working capital and debt service
obligations. Rolling forecasts of liquidity requirements are prepared and monitored, and surplus cash is invested in
interest bearing accounts.

_Currency risk_
Whilst no borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies, a number of suppliers are exposed to the Euro and US
Dollar. Accordingly, wherever possible the Group enters into supply contracts denominated in Sterling. The Group
does not operate a hedging facility to manage currency risk as it is not considered to be material.

_Credit risk_
The Group's cash balances are held on deposit with a number of UK banking institutions. Credit risk in respect of the
Group's revenue streams is limited as the vast majority of customers pay in advance.

_Financial reporting risk_
The Group's financial systems are required to process a large number of transactions securely and accurately; any
weaknesses in the systems could result in the incorrect reporting of financial results and covenant compliance. This
risk is mitigated by the production of detailed management accounts which are regularly compared to budgets and
forecasts. The Group is also subject to an annual external audit.

The registration number of the Company is 07656429.

Information about the use of financial instruments by the Group is provided in note 14 to the financial statements.

**Future developments**

No changes to the nature of the business are anticipated.

On 27 July 2016, Center Pares Ireland Limited, a related party company, was granted full consent to construct a new
Center Pares holiday village in the Republic of Ireland. Construction has commenced and the new village is
expected to open in late Summer 2019. Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited and Center Pares Ireland Limited have
the same ultimate parent company.

**Dividends**
During the period the Company paid dividends totalling £298.2 million (2017: £48.5 million). The Directors have
proposed the payment of final dividends of £10.0 million and £25.9 million (2017: £nil).

**Directors**
The Directors who served during the period and up to the date of this report, unless otherwise stated, were as
follows:

M P Dalby
C G McKinlay (appointed 3 July 2017)

Z B Vaughan

**Employees**
The Group is committed to providing equal opportunities to all employees, irrespective of their gender, sexual
orientation, marital status, race, nationality, ethnic origin, disability, age or religion. Center Pares is an inclusive
employer and values diversity among its employees. These commitments extend to recruitment and selection,
training, career development, flexible working arrangements, promotion and performance appraisal.

_Disabled employees_
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the
applicant concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled every _effort_ is made to ensure that their
employment with the Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the
training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of
other employees.

_Employee consultation_
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and has continued to keep them informed
on matters affecting them as employees and on the various factors affecting the performance of the Group. This is
principally achieved through formal and informal briefings, the quarterly internal Group magazine 'Center Forward'
and annual presentations of the financial results by the CEO. Employee representatives are consulted regularly on a
wide range of matters affecting their current and future interests, via village and head office council meetings which
take place four times a year. In addition, all employees with more than six months' service receive an annual bonus
related to the overall profitability of the Group.

**Political donations**
No political donations were made in the current or prior period.

 Directors' report For the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)

**Directors' Responsibilities Statement**
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic report, the Directors' report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period. Under that law the
Directors have prepared the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards {IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs

        - state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been followed; and

        - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group
and Company will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Group's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

**Statement of disclosure of information to the auditor**
In accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, in the case of each Director in office at the date the
Directors' report is approved, the following applies:

a) so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group's auditor is
unaware; and
b) he/she has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make him/herself aware
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group's auditor is aware of that information.

**Independent auditor**

Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act 2006.

**Basis for opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs(UK)) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's
Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following matters where:

          - the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of the financial statements is not
appropriate; or

          - the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may
cast significant doubt about the Group's or Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting for a period of at least 12 months from the date when the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

**Other information**
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in
the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to
report that fact.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

 Independent auditor's report to the members of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited (continued)

**Responsibilities of Directors**
As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as
the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent
Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.orq.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's
report.

**Use of our report**
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

**Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

          - the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors' report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

          - the Strategic report and the Directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the Parent Company and their environment
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic report or the
Directors' report.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report in respect of the following matters if, in our opinion:

          - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit

have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

          - the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

          - certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

          - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018**

###### 1. Accounting policies

**General information**
The Company is a private company limited by shares, which is incorporated and domiciled in the UK, and is
registered in England and Wales. The address of its registered office is One Edison Rise, New Ollerton, Newark,
Nottinghamshire, NG22 9DP.

**Basis of preparation**
These consolidated financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (2017: 52 weeks ended 20 April 2017)
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC) and Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) interpretations adopted by the European Union and with those
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments and
retirement benefit obligations. All accounting policies disclosed have been applied consistently to both periods
presented.

The accounting reference date of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited is 22 April.

**Going concern**
The Directors have assessed the financial positions of the Group and the Company in light of the net current liabilities
positions at the end of the period. In assessing the going concern of the business they have considered the
projected future trading and cash flows of the business. Using the evidence available to them they have concluded
that it is appropriate to present the financial statements on a going concern basis, as they consider that the Group will
continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements.

**Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited ('the
Company') and entities controlled by the Company. A company controls another entity when it is exposed, or has
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with that entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over that entity.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of CPUK Finance Limited, a company set up with the
sole purpose of issuing debt secured on assets owned by the Group. The Directors of Center Pares (Holdings 1)
Limited consider this company meets the definition of a structured entity under IFRS 10 'Consolidated financial
statements' and hence for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements it has been treated as a subsidiary
undertaking. Details of this company are provided in note 26.

The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared for the same financial reporting period as the
Company.

The consolidated financial statements of Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited have been prepared under the principles
of predecessor accounting and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts. This accounting
treatment results in differences on consolidation between consideration and the fair value of underlying net assets
and this difference is included within equity as an other reserve.

On 11 June 2015 the Group acquired CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited; prior to that date both the Group
and CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited were under the common control of the parent company CP Cayman
Midco 1 Limited. The acquisition formed part of a group reconstruction and has been accounted for using merger
accounting principles which present the financial statements as if CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited had
always been part of the Group using the pre-combination carrying values.

Under merger accounting principles, the assets and liabilities of CP Woburn (Operating Company) Limited have been
consolidated based on their pre-combination book values and the difference between the consideration payable and
the book values of the net assets is recorded in equity in the other reserve.

###### Center Pares (Holdings 1) Limited

 Notes to the financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)

 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**
The preparation of financial statements requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Critical judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies

_Discount rate used to detennine the carrying value of the Group's defined benefit pension scheme obligation:_
The Group's defined benefit pension scheme obligation is discounted at a rate set by reference to market yields at
the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Significant judgment is required when setting the
criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

_Useful economic lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets:_
The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets at the end
of each reporting period. During the current period, the Directors have concluded that no revision is required to either
useful economic lives or residual values of these assets.

_Impairment test for goodwill:_
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to
which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate future cash flows
expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.

**Revenue**
Revenue relates to accommodation rental income on holidays commenced during the period, together with other
related income that primarily arises from on-village leisure, retail and food and beverage spend. Revenue relating to
accommodation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the holiday. Non-rental income is recognised
when the related product or service is provided to the guest. All revenue is recorded net of VAT.

Payment for accommodation rental income is received in advance of holidays commencing, and is recorded as
'payments on account' within Trade and other payables until the holiday commences. A number of trading units on
each holiday village are operated by concession partners. Revenue due in respect of such units is recognised on an
accruals basis. All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.

**Cost of sales**
Cost of sales comprise the cost of goods and services provided to guests. All costs to the point of sale, including
direct employee costs, are included within cost of sales.

**Operating segments**
The operating segments set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements are consistent with the internal
reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 'Operating Segments'. The Chief
Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.

**Exceptional/non-underlying items**
Exceptional/non-underlying items are defined as those that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency,
warrant separate disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the
Group. Non-underlying items are those that are not directly related to the ongoing trade of the business or that are
unrepresentative of ongoing performance. Examples of exceptional/non-underlying items are the costs of Group
restructures, expenses incurred when refinancing the Group's debt and movements in the fair value of embedded
derivatives.

**Goodwill**
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is instead tested
for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is allocated to
cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)**

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Other intangible assets**
_Software_
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the
specific software. These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are
generally considered to be either four or seven years.

Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the
Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as
intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of
relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated
useful lives.

_Other intangible assets_
Other purchased intangible assets are capitalised at cost, amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful
economic lives and tested for impairment annually.

The brand is not amortised as it is considered to have an indefinite life; the carrying value of the brand is subject to
an annual impairment review.

**Impairment of assets**
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which
the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair
value less costs to sell and value-in-use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows { cash-generating units).

**Property, plant and equipment**
Management chose the cost basis under IAS 16 'Property, plant and equipment', rather than to apply the alternative
{revaluation) treatment to all items of property, plant and equipment as its ongoing accounting policy. The cost of
property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable costs. The Group elected to apply the optional exemption
of IFRS 1 'First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards' and, as such, the carrying value of
properties that were previously held at fair value was treated as deemed cost at the date of adoption of IFRS.

Depreciation is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment (except assets in the course of construction)
so as to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the
assets concerned, which are typically as follows:

Installations 10 to 20 years
Fixtures and fittings 5 to 10 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Computer hardware 4 years

Buildings are depreciated to residual value over 50 years. Land is not depreciated. The Group's water boreholes are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over 13 years.

Useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and revised where expectations are
significantly different from previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for current and future periods
is adjusted accordingly.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the
cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other
borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the year in which they are incurred.

**Maintenance expenditure**
It is the policy of the Group to maintain its land and buildings to a high standard. Where maintenance expenditure
increases the benefits that property, plant and equipment is expected to generate, this expenditure is capitalised. All
other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

 Notes to the financial statements
**for the 53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 (continued)**

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Leases**
Leases are classified as finance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at cost and depreciated over their useful lives. The capital element
of future rentals is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged to the income statement over the period of
the lease in proportion to the capital outstanding.

Rental payments on operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor and including minimum
contractual rental increases) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.

**Investments in subsidiary undertakings**
Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for permanent diminution in value. If there are indications of
impairment, an assessment is made of the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income
statement when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. Dividends receivable from investments in
subsidiary undertakings are recognised in the income statement when approved by the shareholders of the company
paying the dividend.

**Current and deferred tax**
The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed by
the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. Differences are defined
as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Such assets and liabilities
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither
the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax on properties assumes recovery through sale.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or
the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis.

**Inventories**
The basis of valuation of inventories is the lower of cost on a first in first out basis and estimated net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable selling
expenses. Inventory provisions are created where necessary to ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of cost
and estimated net realisable value.

**Financial instruments**
The Group classifies its financial assets into two categories, being fair value through profit and loss, and loans and
receivables. Financial liabilities are classified as either fair value through profit and loss or other financial liabilities.
The classification depends on the nature of the financial instrument acquired. Management determines the
classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each reporting date.
Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Loans and receivables**
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade
and other receivables in the balance sheet.

###### 1. Accounting policies (continued)

**Investments**
The cost of investments, including loans to related parties, is their purchase cost together with any incremental costs
of acquisition. The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In deciding whether an impairment is required, the Directors consider
the underlying value inherent in the investment. Provision is made against the cost of investments where, in the
opinion of the Directors, there is an impairment in the value of the individual investment.

**Trade receivables**
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. A prov1s1on for
impairment of trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the
income statement.

**Cash and cash equivalents**
For the purposes of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at
bank and cash in hand.

**Borrowings**
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**Borrowing costs**
Interest on borrowings is treated as an expense in the income statement, with the exception of interest costs incurred
on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.

**Early termination costs**
Costs associated with the early repayment of borrowings are written off to the income statement as incurred.

**Derivative financial instruments**
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments have historically been
used by the Group to manage its exposure to interest rates on long-term floating-rate borrowings. All derivative
financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value. The Group does not currently hedge
account for any derivatives. As such, any gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the income statement.

**Embedded derivatives**
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not
measured at fair value through profit and loss.

**Trade payables**
Trade payables are obligations to pay f[o]r goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not. they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**Provisions**
Provisions for legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where there are a
number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering
the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any
one item included in the same class of obligations is small.

**Dividend distribution**
Dividend distributions to the Company's shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company's financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company's shareholders. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.

**Foreign currencies**
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. The resulting profit or loss, together with realised profits and losses arising during
the period on the settlement of overseas assets and liabilities, are included in the trading results. Transactions
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the
transaction.

**Employee benefits**
_Pensions_

      - Defined contribution pension scheme

Group employees can choose to be a member of a defined contribution pension scheme. A defined contribution
pension scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The
Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to
pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions are
charged to the income statement as incurred.

      - Defined benefit pension scheme

A funded senior management defined benefit pension scheme also exists. A defined benefit pension scheme is a
pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

The surplus or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together
with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates for
high-quality corporate bonds, which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Remeasurement gains and losses are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

_Profit-sharing and bonus plans_
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into
consideration the profit attributable to the Company's shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises
a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

_Holiday pay_
The Group recognises an appropriate liability for the cost of holiday entitlements not taken at the balance sheet date.

**Share capital**
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds.

**Other reserve**
The other reserve in the consolidated financial statements represents the differences on consolidation arising on the
adoption of predecessor accounting. This comprises the difference between consideration paid and the book value
of net assets acquired in the transaction. The other reserve in the Company financial statements represents the
application of group reconstruction relief in accordance with section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, following the
acquisition of certain subsidiaries in prior periods from fellow group companies.

**New standards and interpretations**
A number of new or revised accounting standards were effective for the first time in the current period; none of these
have impacted the financial statements of the Group or Company and are unlikely to have a material impact in the
future.

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has issued the following new or revised standards and
interpretations with an effective date for financial periods beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and
therefore after the date of these financial statements. The IASB has also issued a number of minor amendments to
standards as part of their annual improvement process.

IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration
New interpretation 1 January 2018
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
New interpretation 1 January 2019

The adoption of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' is expected to change the disclosure given in respect of financial
instruments but not the amounts reported in the financial statements.

The adoption of IFRS 16 'Leases' will result in the recognition of a right-to-use asset and a lease liability in respect of
the leases on the Longleat and Wobum sites. In addition, the lease charge recorded in the income statement will be
bifurcated between the amortisation of the right-to-use asset on a straight-line basis and the interest charge on the
lease liability will be recognised using the effective interest rate method. This will result in the overall charge to the
income statement being higher in the earlier years of a lease than in the later years. Operating lease charges are
currently recognised on a straight-line basis in the income statement. The Directors are assessing the monetary
impact of adopting IFRS 16, and are considering both the full and modified retrospective adoption approaches
permitted under the standard.

The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any other standards and interpretations listed above will have a
material impact on the Group or Company's financial statements in the period of initial application, although the
assessment is ongoing.

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating
Decision Maker, as defined by IFRS 8 'Operating Segments'. The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as
the Board of Directors.

The operating segments are the five holiday villages that the business operates. Central Services costs are centrally
managed administration costs. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group's
accounting policies described in note 1.

The primary profit measure used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker is Adjusted EBITDA, being earnings before
interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional/non-underlying items.

The internal reporting does not disaggregate the balance sheet to each operating segment.

The split of revenue by business stream was £280.0 million (2017: £261.4 million) for accommodation and £189.0
million (2017: £178.9 million) for on-site spend. The split of gross profit was £253.3 million (2017: £237.2 million) for
accommodation and £92.0 million (2017: £87.4 million) for on-site spend.

The Directors monitor the level of non-audit work undertaken by the auditors and ensure it is work which they are
best suited to perform and does not present a risk to their independence and objectivity. The audit fee above
includes £2,000 (2017: £2,000) for the audit of the parent company.

###### 4. Exceptional/non-underlying items

The heavy snowfall in England in March 2018 caused the temporary closure of Longleat Forest and restricted guest
arrivals and activities at all other villages. Guests impacted by the snow were issued refunds of both their
accommodation and on-site spend. This was only the fourth time that a village has had to close in over 30 years of
trading. The Directors estimate that the lost revenue totalled £1.6 million and the overall reduction in EBITDA for the
53 weeks ended 26 April 2018 was approximately £1.5 million. As such, had the heavy snowfall not occurred,
Adjusted EBITDA would have been £229.9 million.

The following exceptional/non-underlying items are reflected in the financial statements:

**2018** 2017
**£m** £m

**Operating items**
Administrative expenses **(2.3)**

Exceptional/non-underlying administrative expenses represent £1.6 million of costs relating to legal claims and
associated settlements, together with £0.?m of one-off restructuring and reorganisation costs. Taxation on these
expenses has also been treated as an exceptional/non-underlying item.

The £26.9 million exceptional/non-underlying finance expense in the period represents the premium paid on the
settlement of the B2 tranche of the Group's secured debt. Taxation on this expense has also been treated as an
exceptional/non-underlying item.

A taxation credit of £1.9 million in respect of a one-off adjustment to group relief has also been treated as an
exceptional/non-underlying item.

The £5.2 million exceptional/non-underlying finance expense in the prior period represented accelerated amortisation
of deferred issue costs in respect of the B2 tranche of secured notes. Taxation on this expense was also treated as
an exceptional/non-underlying item, as was the impact of the change in applicable deferred tax rate from 18% to
17%.

Change of corooration tax rate and factors that may affect future tax charges

Finance Act No. 2 2015, which was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, reduced the standard rate of
corporation tax in the UK to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017.

Finance Act 2016, which was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016, included provisions to reduce the
standard rate of corporation tax in the UK to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.

Deferred tax is calculated at a rate of 17% (2017: 17%).

###### 7. Goodwill

**Group**

**Cost and net book value** **£rn**
At 26 April 2018, 20 April 2017 and 21 April 2016 **157.5**

**Impairment test for goodwill**

Goodwill relates to the acquisition of the Sherwood, Elveden, Longleat and Whinfell Villages only. It is allocated
equally to four cash-generating units (CGUs), being the four villages.

The Directors consider that the economic characteristics and future expectations are materially consistent across
each of the four villages.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash
flow projections based on financial forecasts prepared by management covering a rolling five-year period.

**Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations**

The value-in-use calculation is based on forecasts approved by the Board covering the next ten years with a terminal
value applied after year five.

The key assumptions of the value-in-use calculation are Adjusted EBITDA margin, growth rates and the discount
rate; the long-term growth rate applied is 2.30% (2017: 2.25%) and the discount rate applied is 9.0% (2017: 9.7%).

Management determine forecast Adjusted EBITDA margins based on past performance and expectations of market
development. The growth rates used reflect management's expectations of the future market. Discount rates used
are pre-tax and reflect the specific risks to the Group.

Based on the value-in-use calculations performed, the Directors have concluded that there is no impairment of
goodwill. The Directors have performed sensitivity analysis using the full range of reasonable assumptions and no
impairment triggers have been identified.

The Company has no goodwill.

The brand is considered to have an indefinite life due to the continued investment that is made in the guest facilities
and the ongoing marketing campaigns of the business. An impairment review using the same assumptions as
detailed in note 7 has been undertaken and no impairment was indicated (2017: £nil).

The Company has no other intangible assets.

**Fair value hierarchy**
IFRS 13 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value
hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either

directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

All of the Group's fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 1 (2017: Level 1) and fair values have
been derived from unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets.

**Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities**
The fair value of the Group's secured debt is:

**26 April 2018** 20 April 2017
**Book value** **Fair value** Book value Fair value
**£m** **£m** £m £m

Tranche A2 440.0 545.6 440.0 577.7

Tranche B4 250.0 252.1

**1,768.6** **1,889.0** **1,490.0** **1,681.8**

The fair value of all other financial assets and financial liabilities are approximately equal to their book values.

###### 14. Financial instruments (continued)

**Financial risk management**
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity and borrowings as required. The Group has sought to
reduce its cost of capital by refinancing and restructuring the Group's funding using the underlying asset value.

All tranches of the Group's secured debt are subject to financial covenants. The Directors have assessed future
compliance and at this time do not foresee any breach of the financial covenants.

The overall policy in respect of interest rates is to reduce the Group's exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and the
Group's primary source of borrowings is fixed interest rate loan notes.

The Group does not actively trade in derivative financial instruments.

**Interest rate risk**
As at 26 April 2018 and 20 April 2017 the Group had fixed rate loan notes and a floating rate mortgage as its only
external funding sources.

**Liquidity risk**
As at 26 April 2018, the Group held sufficient levels of cash to enable it to meet its medium-term working capital and
funding obligations. Rolling forecasts of the Group's liquidity requirements are prepared and monitored, and surplus
cash is invested in interest bearing accounts.

**Currency risk**
The Group is exposed to limited currency risk through foreign currency transactions. The Group does not operate a
hedging facility to manage currency risk as it is considered to be insignificant.

**Credit risk**
The Group borrows from well-established institutions with high credit ratings. The Group's cash balances are held on
deposit with a number of UK banking institutions.
