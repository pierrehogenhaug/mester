if you need additional information. By purchasing any Notes, you acknowledge that:

- you have reviewed this offering memorandum and the documents incorporated by reference;

- you have had an opportunity to request from us any additional information that you need from
us, and have reviewed such additional information provided; and

- the Initial Purchasers are not responsible for, and are not, making any representation to you
concerning our future performance or the accuracy or completeness of this offering memorandum
or the documents incorporated by reference.

We are not providing you with any legal, business, regulatory, accounting or tax advice in this
offering memorandum. You should consult your own advisors to assist you in making your
investment decision and to advise you whether you are legally permitted to purchase the Notes.

You must comply with all laws and regulations that apply to you in any place in which you purchase,

at your sole cost and expense, any consents, waivers or approvals that you need in order to purchase
the Notes. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for your compliance with these
legal requirements.

We are making this offering of the Notes in reliance upon exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. These exemptions apply to offers and sales of securities that
do not involve a public offering. THE NOTES HAVE NOT BEEN RECOMMENDED, APPROVED OR
DISAPPROVED BY ANY FEDERAL, STATE OR FOREIGN SECURITIES AUTHORITIES AND SUCH

This offering memorandum contains limited summaries of provisions of certain transaction
documents setting forth the obligations of the parties to the transaction and the enforcement of
such obligations, including the indenture and the purchase agreement. The summaries are not
complete, do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the


-----

provisions of such documents. Copies of this offering memorandum and the transaction documents
will be made available to qualified prospective investors upon request.

The Notes will initially be available in book-entry form only. We expect that the Notes will be
issued in the form of one or more registered global notes. The global notes will be deposited with,
or on behalf of, DTC, and registered in its name or in the name of its nominee. Beneficial interests
in the global notes will be shown on, and transfers of the beneficial interests in the global
notes will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC and its direct and indirect
participants. After the initial issuance of the global notes, certificated notes will be issued in
exchange for global notes only in the limited circumstances set forth in the indenture governing
the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.” In connection with this offering, the Initial
Purchasers participating in this offering may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or
otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Initial Purchasers may bid for and purchase
Notes in the open market and may impose penalty bids. For a description of these activities, see
“Plan of Distribution.”

As described under “Use of Proceeds,” we intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds
from this offering to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, recently completed or future
Eligible Green and/or Social Projects (as defined herein). Pending full allocation of an amount
equal to the net proceeds to Eligible Green and/or Social Projects, we intend to use the net proceeds
to fund the redemption of the remaining $250 million outstanding principal amount of our
February 2021 Senior Notes (as defined herein) and for general corporate purposes, which may
include the repayment of outstanding indebtedness. References herein to “Initial Use of Proceeds”
refer to the use of proceeds described in the preceding sentence pending full allocation of an
amount equal to the net proceeds to Eligible Green and/or Social Projects.

Unless otherwise indicated or the context requires otherwise, references in this offering
memorandum to “our company,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean Starwood Property
Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and variable interest entities (“VIEs”).

**_Notice to prospective investors in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom_**

This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation (as
defined below). This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes
in any Member State of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or in the United Kingdom
(each, a “Relevant State”) will only be made to a legal entity which is a qualified investor under
the Prospectus Regulation (“Qualified Investors”). Accordingly any person making or intending to
make an offer in that Relevant State of Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated
in this offering memorandum may only do so with respect to Qualified Investors. Neither the
Starwood Property Trust, Inc. nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize,
the making of any offer of Notes other than to Qualified Investors. The expression “Prospectus
Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA AND UNITED KINGDOM RETAIL INVESTORS—The Notes are not**
intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the United Kingdom. For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined
in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II, or (iii) not a Qualified Investor.
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA or in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore


-----

offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA
or in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

References to Regulations or Directives include, in relation to the United Kingdom, those
Regulations or Directives as they form part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or have been implemented in United Kingdom domestic
law, as appropriate.

### Summary

_This summary highlights information about us and the Notes being offered by this offering_
_memorandum. This summary is not complete and may not contain all of the information that you_
_should consider prior to investing in the Notes. For a more complete understanding of our_
_company, we encourage you to read this entire document, including the information incorporated_
_by reference into this document._

##### Overview

We are a Maryland corporation that commenced operations in August 2009, upon the completion
of our initial public offering. We are focused primarily on originating, acquiring, financing and
managing mortgage loans and other real estate investments in both the United States and Europe.
As market conditions change over time, we may adjust our strategy to take advantage of changes
in interest rates and credit spreads as well as economic and credit conditions.

We have four reportable business segments as of June 30, 2020 and we refer to the investments
within these segments as our target assets:

- Real estate commercial and residential lending—engages primarily in originating, acquiring,
financing and managing commercial first mortgages, non-agency residential mortgages,
subordinated mortgages, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, commercial mortgage-backed
securities (“CMBS”), residential mortgage-backed securities and other real estate and real estaterelated debt investments in both the U.S. and Europe (including distressed or non-performing
loans). Our residential mortgage loans are secured by a first mortgage lien on residential property
and consist of non-agency residential mortgage loans that are not guaranteed by any U.S.
Government agency or federally chartered corporation.

- Infrastructure lending—engages primarily in originating, acquiring, financing and managing
infrastructure debt investments.

- Real estate property—engages primarily in acquiring and managing equity interests in stabilized
commercial real estate properties, including multifamily properties and commercial properties
subject to net leases, that are held for investment.

- Real estate investing and servicing—includes (i) a servicing business in the U.S. that manages
and works out problem assets, (ii) an investment business that selectively acquires and manages
unrated, investment grade and non-investment grade rated CMBS, including subordinated
interests of securitization and resecuritization transactions, (iii) a mortgage loan business which
originates conduit loans for the primary purpose of selling these loans into securitization
transactions and (iv) an investment business that selectively acquires commercial real estate
assets, including properties acquired from CMBS trusts.

Our segments exclude the consolidation of securitization VIEs.

We seek to attain attractive risk-adjusted returns for our investors over the long term by sourcing
and managing a diversified portfolio of target assets, financed in a manner that is designed to
deliver attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles.

We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust (a
“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). We also operate our
business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our various
wholly-owned subsidiaries. We are externally managed and advised by SPT Management, LLC (our


-----

“manager”) pursuant to the terms of a management agreement. Our manager is controlled by
Barry Sternlicht, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our manager is an affiliate of Starwood
Capital Group Global, L.P. (“Starwood Capital Group”), a privately-held private equity firm
founded by Mr. Sternlicht.

Our corporate headquarters office is located at 591 West Putnam Avenue, Greenwich,
Connecticut 06830, and our telephone number is (203) 422-7700.

##### Recent developments

**Preliminary unaudited results for the three months ended September 30, 2020. As of the date of**
this offering memorandum, we are providing preliminary, unaudited results for the three months
ended September 30, 2020 based on currently available information. Our independent auditor has
not completed a review of these preliminary estimated financial results. Our actual results may
vary from the preliminary results, and such variance may be material. In addition, these preliminary
results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period, including
the year ending December 31, 2020. This preliminary financial data has been prepared by us and
is our own responsibility. We have not fully completed our review of these preliminary financial
results for the three months ended September 30, 2020.

During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we declared a dividend of $0.48 per share
and expect earnings per diluted share in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“GAAP”) to be in the range $0.51 to $0.53, with Core Earnings
per diluted share (a non-GAAP financial measure) in the range of $0.49 to $0.51. See below for an
important discussion regarding Core Earnings, including a reconciliation of estimated GAAP
earnings to estimated Core Earnings per diluted share.

During the three months ended September 30, 2020, 97% of interest payments due on our
commercial loan portfolio were current. We collected 100% of interest payments due on our
infrastructure loan portfolio. On our property portfolio, rent collections averaged 96% for the
months of July and August, and 92% of September rents have been collected through
September 30, 2020.

We estimate our book value as of September 30, 2020 to be approximately $4.51 billion, or
$15.85 to $15.87 per share as of September 30, 2020. Book value and book value per share as of
June 30, 2020 were $4.49 billion and $15.79, respectively. We estimate our undepreciated book
value per share to be approximately $17.16 to $17.18 as of September 30, 2020 compared to
$17.03 as of June 30, 2020.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, we funded $1.5 billion of new investments and
$273 million under pre-existing loan commitments. These investments, net of repayments and
securitization proceeds received in the quarter, were principally made using our secured financing
agreements, resulting in an increase in net borrowings of $780 million during the quarter. As a
result, we expect to have an adjusted debt-to-equity ratio[1] of 2.1x as of September 30, 2020, a slight
increase from 2.0x at June 30, 2020. The ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt is
expected to be 1.5x as of September 30, 2020.

As of October 12, 2020, we had $664 million of liquidity, including $473 million of cash and
$191 million of approved but undrawn capacity on our secured financing agreements. During the
quarter ended September 30, 2020, we extended maturities on seven facilities with an aggregate
maximum facility size of $5.1 billion, including $4.6 billion related to commercial lending facilities
and $500 million related to infrastructure lending facilities.

obligations), less cash and restricted cash, divided by (ii) undepreciated equity.

regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net
income (loss); and (vi) any deductions for distributions payable with respect to equity securities
of subsidiaries issued in exchange for properties or interests therein.

We believe that Core Earnings provides an additional measure of our core operating performance
by eliminating the impact of certain non-cash expenses and facilitating a comparison of our
financial results to those of other comparable REITs with fewer or no non-cash adjustments and
comparison of our own operating results from period to period. Our management uses Core
Earnings in this way, and also uses Core Earnings to compute the incentive fee due under our
external management agreement. We believe that our investors also use Core Earnings or a
comparable supplemental performance measure to evaluate and compare our performance with
the performance of our peers, and as such, we believe that the disclosure of Core Earnings is
useful to (and expected by) our investors.

However, we caution that Core Earnings does not represent cash generated from operating
activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income
(loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), or an indication of our cash flows from operating
activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of
funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition,
our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by
other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly,
our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other
REITs.

**COVID-19 pandemic. We are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on us,**
the borrowers underlying our commercial and residential real estate-related loans and
infrastructure loans (and their tenants), the tenants in the properties we own, our financing
sources, and the economy as a whole. Because the severity, magnitude and duration of the


-----

COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult
to predict, the pandemic’s impact on us, which could be significant, remains uncertain and difficult
to predict.

In our commercial lending portfolio,12 payment related loan modifications have been executed
to date, representing an aggregate principal balance of $1.3 billion, and resulting in net interest
deferrals of $10.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2020. These loan
modifications principally included temporary deferrals of interest and the repurposing of reserves,
many of which were coupled with additional equity commitments from sponsors. While we
believe the principal amounts of our loans are generally adequately protected by underlying
collateral value, there is a risk that we will not realize the entire principal value of certain
investments.

Within residential lending, we continue to monitor the impact of forbearance arrangements
granted by the master servicer. For securitization structures containing advancing arrangements,
the master servicer has continued to advance 100% of all unpaid principal and interest.

In our property portfolio, rent collections averaged 96% for the months of July and August, with
92% of September rents collected through September 30, 2020. Collections were particularly
strong in the Woodstar I and Woodstar II affordable housing portfolios, which averaged 97%
collections in July and August. Given current demographic trends, which tend to favor flexible
rental arrangements, we continue to see sustained demand in multifamily and decreased turnover.

In our infrastructure lending portfolio, 100% of interest due during the three months ended
September 30, 2020 was collected. The borrowers did not request, nor did we grant, any payment
related loan modifications during the three months ended September 30, 2020.

For a further description of certain risks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the section
entitled “Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020,
which is incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum.

**Conditional notice of partial redemption of 3.625% Senior Notes due 2021. On October 2, 2020,**
we issued a conditional notice of partial redemption to the holders of our 3.625% Senior Notes due
2021 (our “February 2021 Senior Notes”) indicating that we have elected to redeem 50% (i.e.,
$250 million) of our outstanding February 2021 Senior Notes on November 2, 2020. The partial
redemption of the February 2021 Senior Notes is conditioned on the closing, on or prior to the
redemption date, of the Term Loan B described below, which closed on October 16, 2020.

**Term Loan B. On September 21, 2020, Starwood Property Mortgage, L.L.C. (“SPM”), our wholly**
owned subsidiary, priced a $250 million term loan (“Term Loan B”) to be issued pursuant to that
certain Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of July 26, 2019, among SPM, as borrower, us, as
parent, the lenders from time to time party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., an affiliate
of one of the Initial Purchasers, as administrative agent. The Term Loan B priced at LIBOR plus 350
basis points, matures in July 2026 (coterminous with SPM’s existing $400 million term loan B),
and is callable at any time. The Term Loan B closed on October 16, 2020.

**Dividend declaration. On September 16, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of**
$0.48 per share of common stock for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The dividend was
paid on October 15, 2020 to stockholders of record as of September 30, 2020.

As of June 30, 2020, we had approximately
$10.8 billion of total consolidated indebtedness
(excluding accounts payable, accrued expenses,
other liabilities, securitization VIE liabilities and
unfunded commitments), of which approximately
$8.8 billion was secured indebtedness. Of that
$10.8 billion of total consolidated indebtedness,
approximately $8.8 billion was indebtedness of our
subsidiaries, all of which was secured indebtedness.
As of June 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to (1) the issuance and sale of the Notes in
this offering, (2) the Initial Use of Proceeds (as
defined below), (3) the closing of the Term Loan B
and (4) the use of Term Loan B proceeds to fund the
partial redemption on November 2, 2020 of our
February 2021 Senior Notes, we would have had
approximately $10.8 billion of total consolidated
indebtedness (excluding accounts payable, accrued
expenses, other liabilities, securitization VIE
liabilities and unfunded commitments), of which
approximately $9.0 billion would have been secured
indebtedness. Of that $10.8 billion of pro forma
total consolidated indebtedness, approximately
$9.0 billion would have been indebtedness of our
subsidiaries, all of which would have been secured
indebtedness. For additional information, see
“Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”

accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the applicable date of redemption.


-----

**Change of Control Offer . . . . . . . . . . . .** If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, we
will be required (unless we have exercised our
right to redeem all of the Notes by sending a notice
of redemption) to offer to repurchase all of the
outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued
and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
applicable Change of Control Payment Date.

**Indenture; Certain covenants . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be issued under an indenture (as the
same may be amended or supplemented from
time to time, the “Indenture”) between us and The
Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the
“Trustee”). The Indenture will contain covenants
that, among other things:

                         - limit the ability of us and our subsidiaries to incur
additional indebtedness;

                      - require that we maintain Total Unencumbered
Assets of not less than 120% of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Unsecured
Indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries, in each
case determined on a consolidated basis; and

                       - impose certain requirements in order for us to
merge or consolidate with or transfer all or
substantially all of our assets to another person.

These covenants are subject to a number of
important exceptions and limitations, and we and
our subsidiaries will have the ability to incur
substantial amounts of additional secured and
unsecured indebtedness notwithstanding these
covenants. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
Covenants.”

**Covenant termination . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The covenants in the Indenture limiting our and
our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional
indebtedness, as well as the covenant described
above under “— Possible Future Guarantees” (other
than the portions of such covenant limiting the
obligations of each Guarantor, if any, under its
Guarantee of the Notes to prevent such obligations
from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer under applicable law and the
portions of such covenant relating to the release of
any Guarantor from its Guarantee of the Notes),
certain portions of the covenant limiting our ability
to merge or consolidate with or transfer all or
substantially all of our assets to another person
and, if any of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the
Notes, all of such Guarantees and all of the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Indenture,


-----

will automatically and permanently terminate and
will be of no further force or effect, and we will be
automatically and permanently released from our
obligations under such covenants (and the
Guarantors, if any, will be automatically and
permanently released from their Guarantees of the
Notes and all of their obligations under the
Indenture) on and after any date that (a) the Notes
have Investment Grade Ratings from each of two
specified rating agencies and (b) no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing. See
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
Covenant Termination.”

**No registration rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We are not required and do not intend to register
the Notes for resale under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and we
are not required and do not intend to offer to
exchange the Notes for notes registered under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction.

**Transfer restrictions** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We have not registered the Notes under the
Securities Act or any state or other securities laws.
The Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer and
may only be offered or sold in transactions exempt
from or not subject to the registration requirements
of the Securities Act and other applicable
securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**No prior market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is
currently no market. Although certain of the Initial
Purchasers have informed us that they intend to
make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated
to do so, and they may discontinue market making
activities at any time without notice. Accordingly,
we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the
Notes will develop or be maintained.

**No listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will not be listed on any securities
exchange or included in any quotation system.

through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee
and such interests may not be exchanged for
certificated Notes, except in limited circumstances.

**Use of proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We estimate that the net proceeds from this
offering will be approximately $ million,


-----

after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts
and commissions and other estimated offering
expenses payable by us. We intend to allocate an
amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering
to finance or refinance, in whole or in part,
recently completed or future Eligible Green and/or
Social Projects (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”).
Net proceeds allocated to previously incurred costs
associated with Eligible Green and/or Social
Projects will be available for the repayment of
indebtedness previously incurred. Pending full
allocation of an amount equal to the net proceeds
to Eligible Green and/or Social Projects, we intend
to use the net proceeds to fund the redemption of
the remaining $250 million outstanding principal
amount of our February 2021 Senior Notes
(assuming the completion of the partial redemption
of $250 million outstanding principal amount of
our February 2021 Senior Notes on November 2,
2020, as described above under “—Recent
Developments—Conditional Notice of Partial
Redemption of 3.625% Senior Notes Due 2021”),
and for general corporate purposes, which may
include the repayment of outstanding indebtedness
(such initial use of proceeds, the “Initial Use of
Proceeds”). See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Risk factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** An investment in the Notes involves risks, and
prospective investors should carefully consider the
matters discussed under “Risk Factors” beginning on
page 11 of this offering memorandum and in the
reports we file with the SEC pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”), incorporated by reference into this
offering memorandum, before making a decision
to invest in the Notes.

### Risk factors

_Investing in the Notes involves risks. You should carefully read and consider the risks described_
_below as well as the risks described in the sections entitled “Item 1. Business” and “Item 1A. Risk_
_Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as_
_supplemented by the section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Reports on_
_Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, each of which is incorporated_
_by reference into this offering memorandum. You should also carefully read and consider the_
_sections entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019_
_and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 and_
_other information contained in and incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum,_
_as well as risks described above in “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,”_
_and the uncertainties described above under “Summary—Recent Developments” with respect to_
_the use of preliminary financial information, before making a decision to invest in the Notes. Each_
_of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of_
_operations, liquidity and prospects and could result in a partial or complete loss of your investment._
_To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, operations, financial_
_condition and operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other_
_risks described in this “Risk Factors” section and those described in our Annual Report on Form_
_10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters_
_ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, which are incorporated by reference in this offering_
_memorandum. Certain capitalized terms used in this “Risk Factors” section and not defined_
_previously in this offering memorandum are defined under the caption “Description of the Notes.”_

##### Risks related to the notes and to this offering

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results_**
**_of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes._**

We currently have and, after this offering, will continue to have a significant amount of
indebtedness. As of June 30, 2020, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately
$10.8 billion (excluding accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities, securitization VIE
liabilities and unfunded commitments). As of June 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect
to (1) the issuance and sale of the Notes in this offering, (2) the Initial Use of Proceeds, (3) the
closing of the Term Loan B and (4) the use of Term Loan B proceeds to fund the partial redemption
on November 2, 2020 of our February 2021 Senior Notes, we would have had approximately
$10.8 billion of total consolidated indebtedness (excluding accounts payable, accrued expenses,
other liabilities, securitization VIE liabilities and unfunded commitments). For additional
information, see “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.” This substantial level of indebtedness
increases the risk that we may be unable to generate enough cash to pay amounts due in respect
of our indebtedness, including the Notes.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you and significant effects
on our business. For example, it could:

- make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

- increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

- require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on
our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital,
capital expenditures, our strategic growth initiatives and development efforts and other general
corporate purposes;


-----

- limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in
which we operate;

- restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;

- place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness;
and

- limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate
purposes.

Moreover, the financial covenants in the Indenture are subject to numerous exceptions and
permit us to incur indebtedness subject to, among other exceptions, compliance with certain
financial ratios and we and our subsidiaries will likely be able to incur substantial additional
secured and unsecured indebtedness without violating such covenants. In addition, the Indenture
will not impose any limitation on the incurrence or issuance by us or our subsidiaries of liabilities
that are not considered Indebtedness and the financial covenants in the Indenture will not apply to
VIEs because, under the Indenture, they will not be considered to be our Subsidiaries, and the
Indenture will allow us to deconsolidate VIEs for purposes of, among other things, determining
compliance with the financial covenants and the amount of our Indebtedness.

In addition, the agreements that govern our current indebtedness contain, and the agreements
that may govern any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other
restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term
best interests. Furthermore, the Indenture will not restrict us or our subsidiaries from paying
dividends or making other distributions on our securities, repurchasing capital stock or indebtedness
or making investments, which could adversely impact our ability to make payments on the
Notes. For information regarding the amount of secured and unsecured indebtedness of us and
certain of our subsidiaries, see “—The Notes and any Guarantees will be unsecured and effectively
subordinated in right of payment to our existing and future secured indebtedness and secured
guarantees to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and guarantees” and
“—The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to the indebtedness, guarantees
and other liabilities (including trade payables) and preferred equity of our subsidiaries that do
not guarantee the Notes and any of our subsidiaries that guarantees the Notes will also be required
to guarantee certain debt in addition to the Notes” below.

**_Despite our current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more_**
**_indebtedness, including secured debt. This could exacerbate the risks associated with our_**
**_substantial leverage._**

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including debt under
the Existing Credit Agreements, the Existing Repurchase Agreements and any future credit and
repurchase agreements that we or our subsidiaries may enter into. In particular, as of June 30,
2020, approximately $9.5 billion (of which $640.9 million has been approved but remains undrawn),
was available in the aggregate to be borrowed under the Existing Credit Agreements and the
Existing Repurchase Agreements, subject to certain conditions. We and our subsidiaries may also
be able to incur additional secured debt, which would be effectively senior in right of payment to
the Notes and, in the case of any subsidiaries that guarantee the Notes, their Guarantees of the
Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. Our organizational
documents contain no limitations regarding the maximum level of indebtedness that we may incur.
The Indenture will restrict us and our subsidiaries from incurring additional debt, but these
restrictions are subject to numerous exceptions and permit us and our subsidiaries to incur
indebtedness subject to compliance with certain financial ratios and under other exceptions to
these restrictions, and we and our subsidiaries will retain the ability to incur substantial amounts


-----

of secured and unsecured indebtedness without violating these restrictions. In addition, the
Indenture will not prevent us or our subsidiaries from incurring liabilities that do not constitute
Indebtedness and the financial covenants in the Indenture will not apply to VIEs because, under the
Indenture, they will not be considered to be our Subsidiaries and the Indenture will allow us to
deconsolidate VIEs for purposes of, among other things, determining compliance with the financial
covenants and the amount of our Indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes.” If new debt or
other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could
intensify.

**_If we default in our obligations under the instruments governing our other indebtedness, we_**
**_may not be able to make payments on the Notes._**

A failure by us to comply with our contractual obligations (including restrictive, financial and
other covenants), to pay our indebtedness and fixed costs or to post collateral (including under
hedging arrangements) could result in a variety of material adverse consequences, including a
default under our indebtedness (including the Notes) and the exercise of remedies by our creditors,
lessors and other contracting parties, and such defaults could trigger additional defaults under
other indebtedness or agreements.

In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could, in general, elect to declare
all of such indebtedness to be immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, and, in the case of secured indebtedness, seize and sell the collateral securing that
indebtedness. If our operating performance declines, we may need to seek waivers from the
holders of our indebtedness to avoid being in default under the instruments governing such
indebtedness. If we breach our covenants under our indebtedness, we may not be able to obtain
a waiver from the holders of such indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all. If this occurs,
we would be in default under such indebtedness, and the holders of such indebtedness and lenders
could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or
liquidation. A default under the agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness and
the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could make us unable to pay principal of,
or premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, which may result in the loss of some or all of your
investment.

**_Our ability to repay our debt, including the Notes, depends on the performance of our subsidiaries_**
**_and their ability to make distributions to us._**

As a holding company, substantially all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries,
which are separate and distinct legal entities and, except in the case of our subsidiaries, if any,
that may guarantee the Notes in the future under the circumstances described under “Description
of the Notes—Possible Future Guarantees,” have no contractual or other obligations to make
payments due on the Notes or to provide funds to us for that purpose. Therefore, our ability to
service our indebtedness, including the Notes, and to meet our other cash needs is dependent on
the earnings of, and the distribution of funds (whether by dividend, distribution, loan or
otherwise) to us by, our subsidiaries. The availability of funds from our subsidiaries will depend
upon, among other things, their operating results, financial condition and legal or contractual
restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and distributions or make loans to us. We cannot assure
you that our subsidiaries will have sufficient funds, or that the agreements governing the existing
and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will not restrict or prevent our subsidiaries from
providing us with sufficient funds, to make payments on the Notes when due and to meet our
other cash needs, and the Indenture will not restrict our subsidiaries from entering into such
restrictive agreements. In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions or loans to us by our
subsidiaries that may be organized or doing business outside of the United States could be subject
to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law and monetary
transfer restrictions in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate and, even if we are able to


-----

repatriate funds from foreign subsidiaries, the repatriation of those funds may be subject to
significant taxes. Furthermore, we guarantee many of the obligations of our subsidiaries and such
guarantees may require us to provide substantial funds or assets to our subsidiaries or their
creditors at a time when we need liquidity to fund our own obligations, such as the Notes.

In addition, any right that we have to receive any assets of or distributions from any subsidiary
upon its bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or winding-up, or to
realize proceeds from the sale of the assets of any subsidiary, would be junior to the claims of that
subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors, and to holders of any preferred equity issued by
that subsidiary or any indebtedness or other liabilities guaranteed by that subsidiary.

**_The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to the indebtedness, guarantees_**
**_and other liabilities (including trade payables) and preferred equity of our subsidiaries that do not_**
**_guarantee the Notes and any of our subsidiaries that guarantees the Notes will also be required_**
**_to guarantee certain debt in addition to the Notes._**

When the Notes are first issued they will not be guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and none
of our subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the Notes in the future, except under the
circumstances set forth in the covenant described in “Description of the Notes—Possible Future
Guarantees.” Moreover, certain classes of our subsidiaries (namely Excluded Subsidiaries,
Securitization Entities and Foreign Subsidiaries) are excluded from any requirement to guarantee
the Notes and any subsidiary that does guarantee the Notes may be released from its guarantee
of the Notes under the circumstances described under “Description of the Notes—Possible Future
Guarantees” or its guarantee of the Notes may automatically and permanently terminate under
the circumstances described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Covenant
Termination.” See, also, the definitions of Excluded Subsidiary, Securitization Entity and Foreign
Subsidiary under the caption “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions.”

Our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts
due on the Notes or to make any funds available to us to pay these amounts, whether by dividend,
distribution, loan or otherwise. Accordingly, the Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of
payment to all existing and future indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities (including
trade payables) and preferred equity of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. As a result, in the event
of bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or winding-up of any such NonGuarantor Subsidiary, all of its creditors (including trade creditors) and all holders of its preferred
equity and any indebtedness or other liabilities guaranteed by such Non-Guarantor Subsidiary
would be entitled to payment in full out of its assets before we would be entitled to any payment.

If any of our subsidiaries guarantees the Notes, the terms of the Existing Convertible Senior
Notes require that such subsidiary also guarantee the Existing Convertible Senior Notes, and we
may in the future enter into other debt instruments with similar requirements. In addition, the
Existing Senior Notes include a covenant substantially similar to the covenant described under
“Description of the Notes—Possible Future Guarantees,” which could require any of our Domestic
Subsidiaries (other than Excluded Subsidiaries and Securitization Entities) that guarantees the Notes
offered hereby to also guarantee the Existing Senior Notes. As of June 30, 2020, $250.0 million
in aggregate principal amount of Existing Convertible Senior Notes was outstanding and $1.7 billion
aggregate principal amount of our Existing Senior Notes were outstanding.

Certain of our subsidiaries are borrowers or guarantors under the Existing Credit Agreements and
the Existing Repurchase Agreements. As of June 30, 2020, our subsidiaries had approximately
$8.8 billion of indebtedness (excluding accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities,
securitization VIE liabilities and unfunded commitments). As of June 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis
after giving effect to (1) the issuance and sale of the Notes in this offering, (2) the Initial Use of
Proceeds, (3) the closing of the Term Loan B and (4) the use of Term Loan B proceeds to fund the


-----

partial redemption on November 2, 2020 of our February 2021 Senior Notes, our subsidiaries
would have had approximately $9.0 billion of indebtedness (excluding accounts payable, accrued
expenses, other liabilities, securitization VIE liabilities and unfunded commitments). For
additional information, see “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”

**_The Notes and any Guarantees will be unsecured and effectively subordinated in right of_**
**_payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness and secured guarantees of us and any_**
**_Guarantors, respectively, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured_**
**_indebtedness and secured guarantees._**

The Notes and any Guarantees of the Notes by our subsidiaries will be unsecured and therefore
will not have the benefit of any collateral. Accordingly, the Notes and any Guarantees of the Notes
will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness
and secured guarantees of us and any Guarantors, respectively, to the extent of the value of
the assets securing such secured indebtedness and secured guarantees. In that event, the assets
securing such secured indebtedness and secured guarantees would first be used to repay in full all
indebtedness, guarantees and other obligations secured by them, resulting in all or a portion of
our assets or the assets of any Guarantor being unavailable to satisfy the claims of the holders of the
Notes and other unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any distribution or payment
of our assets or the assets of any Guarantor in any insolvency, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation,
reorganization or other bankruptcy proceeding, holders of the Notes will participate in our
remaining assets or the remaining assets of such Guarantor, as applicable, ratably with all holders
of unsecured indebtedness, unsecured guarantees or other unsecured obligations (including
trade payables) of us or such Guarantor, as applicable. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot
assure you that there will be sufficient assets, or any assets, to pay amounts due on the Notes.
As a result, holders of the Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of our or our subsidiaries’
secured indebtedness or secured guarantees or may receive no payments whatsoever.

As of June 30, 2020, we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $10.8 billion
(excluding accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities, securitization VIE liabilities and
unfunded commitments), of which approximately $8.8 billion was secured indebtedness (including
approximately $8.8 billion of secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries), and, on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to (1) the issuance and sale of the Notes in this offering, (2) the Initial Use
of Proceeds, (3) the closing of the Term Loan B and (4) the use of Term Loan B proceeds to fund
the partial redemption on November 2, 2020 of our February 2021 Senior Notes, as if those
transactions had occurred as of June 30, 2020, we would have had approximately $10.8 billion of
total consolidated indebtedness (excluding accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities,
securitization VIE liabilities and unfunded commitments), of which approximately $9.0 billion would
have been secured indebtedness (including approximately $9.0 billion of secured indebtedness
of our subsidiaries). For additional information, see “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.” In
addition, the Indenture will permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness subject to, among
other things, our maintenance of Total Unencumbered Assets in an amount that is not less than
120% of the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Unsecured Indebtedness and our
compliance with the covenant described under the caption “Description of the Notes—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness.” As of June 30, 2020, we had
a ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt of 1.5x, and, as of the same date, on the
pro forma basis described above in this paragraph, we would have had a ratio of unencumbered
assets to unsecured debt of 1.7x.

**_Our ability to repurchase Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited._**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, we will be required (unless we
have exercised our right to redeem all of the Notes by sending a notice of redemption) to offer
to repurchase all of the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued


-----

and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable Change of Control Payment Date. See
“Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” We may be unable to repurchase the Notes upon
a Change of Control Triggering Event because we may not have sufficient funds available or we
may be prohibited from doing so by the terms of our other indebtedness. In that regard, the
Existing Senior Notes include a covenant substantially similar to the covenant applicable to the
Notes as described under the caption “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” In addition,
a transaction constituting a Change of Control Triggering Event, Change of Control or similar
event and certain other events or transactions relating to, for example, the composition of our
board of directors, our adoption of a plan for liquidation or dissolution, a change of control in our
manager or our manager ceasing to be our manager, constitute or may constitute events of
default or require or may require us to repay or offer to repurchase or repay outstanding
indebtedness under other existing or future credit agreements, repurchase agreements, indentures
or other instruments or agreements relating to Indebtedness to which we or any of our
subsidiaries is or becomes a party. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient
financial resources available to repurchase or repay Notes or other indebtedness should we be
required to do so upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, Change of
Control or other event or transaction. Any failure to repurchase or repay any existing or future
indebtedness, should it become due and payable as the result of a Change of Control Triggering
Event, Change of Control or other event, would likely have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition and could result in the acceleration of other
indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries pursuant to cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions.
In addition, certain existing or future indebtedness of ours and our subsidiaries requires or may
require us or our subsidiaries to repay or offer to repurchase such indebtedness upon the occurrence
of certain changes of control or similar events which may not constitute a Change of Control or
Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Notes.

Moreover, we will be required to offer to repurchase Notes only if both a Change of Control and
certain declines in the credit ratings on the Notes occur. By contrast, any requirement that we
repurchase or repay or offer to repurchase or repay, as applicable, indebtedness outstanding under
the Existing Repurchase Agreements, the Existing Convertible Senior Notes or the Existing Credit
Agreements upon the occurrence of a Change of Control or similar event or certain other events
relating to, for example, certain changes in the composition of our board of directors, our
adoption of a plan of liquidation or dissolution, a change of control in our manager or our manager
ceasing to be our manager, will arise, in each case, without any requirement that there also be a
decline in our credit rating, and other existing and future instruments and agreements relating to
indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries may have similar provisions. As a result, we may be
required to repay or repurchase or offer to repay or repurchase indebtedness outstanding under
the Existing Repurchase Agreements, the Existing Convertible Senior Notes, the Existing Credit
Agreements and other existing and future instruments and agreements relating to indebtedness
before we are required, or without our being required, to repurchase or offer to repurchase the
Notes.

**_The Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Notes may not provide protection in_**
**_the event of certain transactions or in certain other circumstances._**

The provisions of the Notes which may require us to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon
the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described under “Description of the
Notes—Change of Control” may not provide Holders of Notes protection in the event of highly
leveraged transactions, reorganizations, restructurings, takeovers, acquisitions, mergers,
recapitalizations or similar transactions involving us that might adversely affect holders of Notes.
In particular, any such transaction may not give rise to a Change of Control Triggering Event, in
which case we would not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. Except as described
under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” neither the Indenture nor the Notes will


-----

contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that we repurchase or redeem
the Notes in the event of highly leveraged transactions, reorganizations, restructurings, takeovers,
acquisitions, mergers, recapitalizations or similar transactions involving us.

In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of “all or substantially
all” of the assets (subject to certain exceptions) of us and our subsidiaries taken as a whole to any
person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of such assets of us and our subsidiaries. As a result,
it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event has
occurred and whether we are required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described
above, in which case, the ability of a holder of the Notes to obtain the benefit of the offer for
repurchase of all or a portion of the Notes held by such holder may be adversely impacted.

More generally, courts interpreting change of control provisions under New York law (which is
the governing law of the Notes and the Indenture) have not provided a clear and consistent
meaning of such change of control provisions, and no assurance can be given as to how or if a court
would enforce the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions applicable to the Notes or
how those provisions would be impacted were we to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case.

**_If the Notes are rated investment grade by each of two specified rating agencies, certain covenants_**
**_contained in the Indenture and any Guarantees of the Notes will be automatically and_**
**_permanently terminated and released, and you will permanently lose the protection of these_**
**_covenants and any such Guarantees._**

The Indenture will contain a covenant that, subject to exceptions, will limit the incurrence of
additional Indebtedness by us and our subsidiaries. If at any time the Notes receive Investment
Grade Ratings from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and S&P Global Ratings and no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, (i) the foregoing covenant limiting the incurrence of
Indebtedness, as well as a portion of the covenant limiting our ability to merge, consolidate or
transfer all or substantially all of our assets, (ii) the covenant described under “Description of the
Notes—Possible Future Guarantees” that may require, under certain circumstances, one or
more of our Domestic Subsidiaries (subject to exceptions) to guarantee the Notes (other than the
portions of such covenant limiting the obligations of each Guarantor, if any, under its Guarantee
of the Notes to prevent such obligations from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent
transfer under applicable law and the portions of such covenant relating to the release of any
Guarantor from its Guarantee of the Notes), and (iii) the Guarantees, if any, of the Notes and all
of the obligations of the Guarantors, if any, under the Indenture, will be automatically and
permanently terminated and released and will be of no further force or effect. After such
termination, we may incur other indebtedness and take other actions that would have been
prohibited if these covenants had been in effect. Accordingly, if these covenants are terminated,
holders of the Notes will have less covenant protection than at the time the Notes were issued and
will also lose the benefit of any Guarantees of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the
Notes will ever receive any Investment Grade Ratings.

**_The credit ratings assigned to the Notes may not reflect all risks of an investment in the Notes._**

The credit ratings assigned to the Notes reflect the rating agencies’ assessments of our ability to
make payments on the Notes when due. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in these credit
ratings will generally affect the market values of the Notes. These credit ratings, however, may
not reflect the potential impact of risks related to the structure, market or other factors related to
the values of the Notes.


-----

**_Changes in our credit rating could adversely affect the market prices or liquidity of the Notes._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including
us. The credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit
ratings for us based on their overall view of the industry in which we operate. Any credit rating
agencies may lower their initial ratings on the Notes or place the Notes on watch list for a possible
downgrade. A negative change in our ratings could have an adverse effect on the market prices
or liquidity of the Notes.

**_Federal and state laws may permit courts, under specific circumstances, to void the Notes and/or_**
**_any Guarantees as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, subordinate claims in respect of the_**
**_Notes and/or any Guarantees and require you to return payments received. If that occurs, you_**
**_may not receive any payments on the Notes or any Guarantees._**

Federal and state creditor-protection related laws, including fraudulent transfer and fraudulent
conveyance statutes, may apply to the Notes and any Guarantees. Under federal bankruptcy law
and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws, which
may vary from state to state, the Notes or any Guarantees thereof could be voided as fraudulent
transfers or conveyances if we or any Guarantors, as applicable, (i) issued the Notes or incurred any
Guarantees with the actual intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors
or (ii) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either
issuing the Notes or incurring any Guarantees and, in the case of (ii) only, one of the following is
also true at the time thereof:

- we or any such Guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the
issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of any such Guarantees;

- the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of any such Guarantees left us or any such Guarantors,
as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on business; or

- we or any such Guarantors intended to, or believed that we or such Guarantor would, incur
debts beyond our or any Guarantor’s ability to pay as they mature.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer
or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court
could find that we or any Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration for the Notes or any Guarantees, as applicable, to the extent that we or any
Guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance
of the Notes or the applicable Guarantees.

The bankruptcy code defines “insolvent” as to an entity other than a partnership or a municipality
as the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, being greater than the
fair value of all of its assets. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine
whether or not we or any Guarantors were insolvent at the relevant time.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of a Guarantee of the
Notes was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under
the Notes or that Guarantee (the effect being that holders of the Notes would cease to have a
claim under the Notes or such Guarantee) or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any
amounts received with respect to the Notes or that Guarantee. In the event of a finding that a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes.
Further, the voiding of the Notes or any Guarantees could result in an event of default with respect
to the Notes or our and our subsidiaries’ other debt that could result in acceleration of the
Notes or that debt.

Although the Indenture will contain a provision intended to limit any Guarantor’s liability under
its Guarantee of the Notes to the maximum amount as will not result in the obligations of such


-----

Guarantor under its Guarantee of the Notes constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent
transfer under applicable federal, foreign or state law, this provision may not be effective to protect
any Guarantees of the Notes from being voided under fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent
transfer or similar laws, or prevent that Guarantor’s obligation from being reduced to an amount
that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. For example, in 2009, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
for the Southern District of Florida in Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of TOUSA, Inc. v.
_Citicorp N. Am., Inc. voided certain secured guarantees issued by certain subsidiary guarantors_
notwithstanding the existence of a similar provision which the court found to be ineffective in that
case; this decision was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals on May 15, 2012. If any
Guarantees of the Notes by any Guarantors were held to be unenforceable, the Notes would be
effectively subordinated to all indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities, including trade
payables, and preferred equity of such Guarantor.

Finally, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees
of the Notes to other claims against us or any Guarantors under the principle of equitable
subordination if the court determines that (i) the holder of Notes engaged in some type of
inequitable conduct, (ii) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or
conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Notes and (iii) equitable subordination is not
inconsistent with the provisions of the bankruptcy code.

**_If any of our subsidiaries guarantees the Notes, such Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantee of_**
**_the Notes may be reduced to zero, voided or released under certain circumstances and you_**
**_may not receive any payments from some or all of the Guarantors._**

When the Notes are first issued they will not be guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and none
of our subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the Notes in the future, except under the
circumstances described in “Description of the Notes—Possible Future Guarantees,” subject to
release of any such subsidiary from its obligations under such Guarantee as described in “Description
of the Notes—Possible Future Guarantees” and to the automatic and permanent release and
termination of all such Guarantees as described in “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
Covenant Termination.” If the Notes are ever guaranteed, the obligations of each Guarantor
under its Guarantee of the Notes will be limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the
obligations of such Guarantor under such Guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer under applicable federal, foreign or state laws. By virtue of this limitation, a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee of the Notes could be significantly less than amounts
due and payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have no obligation under its
Guarantee of the Notes. Moreover, this limitation may not be effective to protect any Guarantees
from being voided under fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar laws or to
prevent that Guarantor’s obligation from being reduced to an amount that effectively makes its
Guarantee worthless. Furthermore, the Notes will lose the benefit of a particular Guarantee thereof
if it is released under the circumstances described in “Description of the Notes—Possible Future
Guarantees” or permanently released and terminated under the circumstances described in
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Covenant Termination.” You will not have a claim
as a creditor against any subsidiary that does not guarantee the Notes or whose Guarantee of
the Notes has been released or terminated, and the indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities,
including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, and preferred equity of those
subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of holders of the Notes.

**_There is no public market for the Notes._**

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Notes may only be
offered or sold in transactions that are not subject to, or that are otherwise exempt from, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or pursuant
to an effective registration statement. Prior to this offering, there was no trading market for the


-----

Notes and we cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the Notes or, if
one does develop, that it will be maintained. If the Notes are traded after their initial issuance, they
may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest
rates, the market for similar securities, our performance and other factors. Historically, there has
been substantial volatility in the prices of corporate debt securities, and the price of the Notes is
likely to be affected by factors which affect the price of corporate debt securities generally. In
addition, the trading prices of fixed rate debt securities like the Notes generally tend to decline
as interest rates rise and governmental action, economic conditions or other factors that cause an
increase in interest rates generally may have an adverse effect on the trading price of the Notes.
We do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the
Notes on any automated quotation system. Although certain of the Initial Purchasers have
informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so, and
they may discontinue market making activities at any time without notice. Accordingly, we
cannot assure you that a liquid market for the Notes will develop or be maintained.

**_There are restrictions on transfers of the Notes and holders of the Notes will not be entitled to_**
**_registration rights._**

The offering of the Notes by us has not been registered under the Securities Act or any state or
other securities laws and the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to require us to offer to
exchange the Notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act or to register
the Notes for resale under the Securities Act. The Notes are being offered and sold only to
persons reasonably believed to be QIBs and non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act. As a result, the Notes may be transferred or resold
only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws. In the absence of such registration or exemption, your
ability to transfer the Notes will be significantly restricted.

**_Redemption may adversely affect your return on the Notes._**

We have the right to redeem some or all of the Notes, at any time in whole or from time to time
in part prior to their maturity, as described under “Description of the Notes—Optional
Redemption.” We may redeem Notes at times when market interest rates may be lower than
market interest rates as of the closing of this offering (the “Issue Date”). Accordingly, if we redeem
Notes, you may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an
effective interest rate as high as that on the Notes.

**_We are not contractually committed to allocate the net proceeds from this offering to Eligible_**
**_Green and/or Social Projects, and our failure to do so could adversely impact the value of the_**
**_Notes._**

The market price of the Notes may be impacted by any failure by us to allocate the net proceeds
from this offering to Eligible Green and/or Social Projects or to meet or continue to meet the
investment requirements of certain environmentally or socially focused investors with respect to
the Notes. Although we intend to allocate all of the net proceeds from this offering to Eligible
Green and/or Social Projects as described herein under “Use of Proceeds,” there can be no
assurance that the relevant project(s) or use(s) the subject of, or related to, any Eligible Green
and/or Social Projects will be capable of being implemented in or substantially in such manner
and/or accordance with any timing schedule and that accordingly such proceeds will be totally or
partially disbursed for such Eligible Green and/or Social Projects. Nor can there be any assurance
that such Eligible Green and/or Social Projects will be completed within any specified period or at
all or with the results or outcome as originally expected or anticipated by us. In addition, none
of the Initial Purchasers for this offering are responsible for assessing or verifying whether or not
the Eligible Green and/or Social Projects to which we allocate the net proceeds of the Notes


-----

meet the criteria described in “Use of Proceeds,” or for the monitoring of the use of proceeds.
Any such event or failure by us will not constitute an Event of Default under the Notes.

**_There can be no assurance that the use of proceeds of the Notes to finance Eligible Green and/or_**
**_Social Projects will be suitable for the investment criteria of an investor._**

It is our intention to apply an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering specifically for
Eligible Green and/or Social Projects. Prospective investors should review the information set out
in this offering memorandum regarding such use of proceeds and must determine for themselves
the relevance of such information for the purpose of any investment in the Notes, together
with any other investigation such investor deems necessary. In particular, no assurance is given by
us or any Initial Purchaser that the use of such net proceeds for any Eligible Green and/or Social
Project will satisfy, whether in whole or in part, any present or future investor expectations or
requirements as regards any investment criteria or guidelines with which such investor or its
investments are required to comply, whether by any present or future applicable law or regulations
or by its own by-laws or other governing rules or investment portfolio mandates, in particular
with regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or social impact of any projects
or uses, the subject of or related to, any Eligible Green and/or Social Projects.

Furthermore, it should be noted that there is currently no clearly defined definition (legal,
regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, a “green”, “social”,
“sustainable” or an equivalently labelled project or as to what precise attributes are required for
a particular project to be defined as “green”, “social”, “sustainable” or such other equivalent
label nor can any assurance be given that such a clear definition or consensus will develop over
time. Accordingly, no assurance is or can be given to investors that any projects or uses the subject
of, or related to, any Eligible Green and/or Social Projects will meet any or all investor expectations
regarding such “green”, “social”, “sustainable” or other equivalently-labelled performance
objectives or that any adverse environmental, social and/or other impacts will not occur during
the implementation of any projects or uses the subject of, or related to, any Eligible Green and/or
Social Projects.

**_Recent changes as well as future changes in U.S. federal income tax law could affect your_**
**_investment in the Notes._**

The rules dealing with federal income taxation are subject to revision by persons involved in the
legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and the U.S. Department of the
Treasury. New legislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court
decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of such qualification. In particular, technical corrections legislation and
implementing regulations may be enacted or promulgated in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
of 2017. In addition, legislation, regulations and other guidance has been enacted to respond to
the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, and
further legislative enactments and other IRS or Treasury action is possible. Furthermore, no
prediction can be made as to the likelihood of passage of new tax legislation or other provisions,
or the direct or indirect effect on us, our stockholders or investors in our Notes. Prospective
investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of changes to the U.S. federal
tax laws prior to purchasing the Notes.

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the Indenture by beneficial owners with short_**
**_positions in excess of their interests in the Notes will be disregarded._**

By acceptance of the Notes, each holder of Notes agrees, in connection with any notice of
default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of default, notice
of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”), to (i) deliver a written


-----

representation to us and the Trustee that such holder and any of its affiliates acting in concert
with it in connection with its investment in the Notes (other than screened affiliates) are not (or,
in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial
owners that (together with such affiliates) are not) Net Short (as defined under “Description of
the Notes—Certain Definitions”) and (ii) provide us with such other information as we may
reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s representation
within five business days of request therefor. These restrictions may impact a holder’s ability to
participate in Noteholder Directions if it is unable to make such a representation.


-----

### Use of proceeds

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $ million, after
deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts and commissions and other estimated offering
expenses payable by us. We intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from this
offering to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, recently completed or future eligible projects
that meet the eligibility criteria described below (such projects, “Eligible Green and/or Social
Projects”) in alignment with the four core pillars of the Green Bond Principles, 2018, Social Bond
Principles, 2020 and Sustainability Bond Guidelines, 2018. Net proceeds allocated to previously
incurred costs associated with Eligible Green and/or Social Projects will be available for the
repayment of indebtedness previously incurred. Pending full allocation of an amount equal to
the net proceeds to Eligible Green and/or Social Projects, we intend to use the net proceeds to fund
the redemption of the remaining $250 million outstanding principal amount of our February 2021
Senior Notes (assuming the completion of the partial redemption of $250 million outstanding
principal amount of our February 2021 Senior Notes on November 2, 2020, as described below),
and for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of outstanding indebtedness
(such initial use of proceeds, the “Initial Use of Proceeds”). This offering memorandum does not
constitute a notice of redemption.

##### Eligible Green and/or Social Projects

Eligible Green and/or Social Projects include investments in, financings of and/or acquisitions of
one or more of the following:

- Renewable Energy, including development, construction, acquisition, maintenance and
operation of renewable energy, such as solar, wind, geothermal, run-of-river hydropower, and
small-scale hydropower (less than or equal to 20 MW) and waste to energy projects. Renewable
energy investments may include those made up to three years before the issuance date of the
Notes.

- Green Buildings, including the development, construction, installation, operation, financing,
acquisition, maintenance, upgrades and associated costs of new or existing commercial or
residential buildings, including buildings that meet regional, national or internationallyrecognized standards or certifications (e.g., LEED Silver, Gold or Platinum). Green building

We expect to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering to Eligible Green
and/or Social Projects as soon as reasonably practicable after the Issue Date and before the maturity
date of the Notes.

##### Process for project evaluation and selection

Our investment committee will evaluate projects for eligibility based on the criteria described
above and recommend the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering among Eligible Green
and/or Social Projects for review and approval by our finance team.


-----

##### Management of proceeds

Our finance team will track the amount of net proceeds from this offering allocated to Eligible
Green and/or Social Projects. Pending full allocation of an amount equal to the net proceeds to
Eligible Green and/or Social Projects, we intend to use the net proceeds for the Initial Use of
Proceeds, as described above.

##### Reporting

Annually, until an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering have been fully allocated
to Eligible Green and/or Social Projects, we intend to publish on our website a Green Bond
Report that will include (i) the amount of net proceeds allocated, (ii) a selection of brief descriptions
of relevant Eligible Green and/or Social Projects and, where feasible, their expected impact
metrics, for example, CO2 equivalent emissions avoided and/or GWh of annual generation and
(iii) the remaining amount of net proceeds yet to be allocated to Eligible Green and/or Social
Projects at the end of the reporting period.

Information contained in, or accessible through, our website and in our Green Bond Report is not
incorporated in, and is not part of, this offering memorandum or any other report or filing we
make with the SEC. Neither the Notes nor the indenture requires us to use the net proceeds from
the sale of the Notes as described above, and any failure by us to comply with the foregoing
will not constitute a breach of or default under the Notes or the indenture. The above description
of the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes is not intended to modify or add any
covenant or other contractual obligation undertaken by us under the Notes or the indenture
governing the Notes.

##### External review

The annual Green Bond Report will be accompanied by (i) an assertion by our manager that an
amount equal to the specified portion of the net proceeds from this offering was allocated to
Eligible Green and/or Social Projects and (ii) a report from an independent registered public
accounting firm in respect of its examination of management’s assertions conducted in accordance
with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

##### Green Bond Principles, 2018, Social Bond Principles, 2020, and Sustainability Bond Guidelines, 2018

These principles are voluntary guidelines that were developed by an industry working group
administered by the International Capital Markets Association and are intended to promote
integrity in the sustainable bond market through recommendations relating to transparency,
disclosure and reporting.

##### Our February 2021 Senior Notes

Our February 2021 Senior Notes mature on February 1, 2021, and, as of June 30, 2020,
approximately $500 million aggregate principal amount of our February 2021 Senior Notes were
outstanding. On October 2, 2020, we issued a conditional notice of partial redemption to the holders
of our February 2021 Senior Notes indicating that we have elected to redeem 50% (i.e., $250 million)
of our outstanding February 2021 Senior Notes on November 2, 2020. The partial redemption of
the February 2021 Senior Notes is conditioned on the closing, on or prior to the redemption date,
of the Term Loan B, which closed on October 16, 2020.

To the extent that any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates own any of our February 2021
Senior Notes, upon the Initial Use of Proceeds, such Initial Purchasers or affiliates will receive a
portion of those net proceeds. See “Plan of Distribution—Other Relationships.”

### Description of the notes

The % Senior Notes due 2023 will be issued under an Indenture dated as of the Issue Date
between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Company
will issue the Notes in a private transaction that is not registered under the Securities Act and
the Notes will initially be subject to certain transfer restrictions. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The following is a description of certain provisions of the Indenture and the Notes. It does not
include all of the provisions of the Indenture and the Notes. We urge you to read the Indenture
because it defines your rights. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and
those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the
“TIA”). You may obtain a copy of the form of the Indenture (which includes the form of the
Notes) as described under “Where You Can Find More Information.”

For purposes of this section, references to the “Company, “us,” “we,” “our” and similar references
include only Starwood Property Trust, Inc. and not its subsidiaries or any other entities that are
consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. You can find definitions of certain
capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under “—Certain Definitions.”

##### General

The Notes we issue on the Issue Date will be limited to an aggregate principal amount of
$300 million. We may issue an unlimited principal amount of Additional Notes under the Indenture
having identical terms as the Notes initially issued under the Indenture on the Issue Date (other
than issue date, and, if applicable, issue price, the first interest payment date and the date from
which interest will accrue, and except that any such Additional Notes may, but need not, be subject
to or include transfer restrictions), provided that if any Additional Notes are not fungible with
the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Additional
Notes will have separate CUSIP and ISIN numbers from the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date.
We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the terms of the
Indenture, including the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness.” The Notes and any Additional Notes subsequently issued
under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture for
purposes of, among other things, payments of principal and interest, Events of Default (as defined
below under “Events of Default”), Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance (as those terms
are defined below under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance”), satisfaction and
discharge, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless otherwise expressly
stated or the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes” section references to the
Notes include any Additional Notes.

The Company will issue the Notes in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of
$2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will initially be issued in bookentry form evidenced by one or more global Notes (“Global Notes”) registered in the name of
the Depositary or its nominee and Notes in definitive certificated form (“certificated Notes”) will
only be issued under the limited circumstances described under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”
The Trustee will initially act as paying agent and registrar for the Notes. The Notes may be
presented for registration of transfer and exchange at the office of the registrar. The Company
may change any paying agent and registrar and may appoint additional paying agents and
registrars without notice to Holders of the Notes. The Company will pay principal (and premium,
if any) on, and may pay interest on, any certificated Notes at the office or agency maintained by the
Company for such purpose in the United States of America, which initially shall be an office of
the Trustee, upon surrender of such certificated Notes by the Holders thereof at such office or
agency. Interest on any certificated Notes may also be paid, at the Company’s option, by check


-----

mailed to the registered addresses of the Holders entitled thereto or by wire transfer to accounts
in the United States of America specified by such Holders. The Company will pay the principal,
premium, if any, and interest on Global Notes registered in the name of the Depositary or its
nominee in immediately available funds to the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as
Holder of such Global Notes.

##### Principal, maturity and interest

The Notes will mature on, 2023. The Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of any
mandatory sinking fund.

Interest on the Notes will be payable semiannually in arrears in cash at a rate of % per
annum. Interest will be paid on the Notes on each and, commencing
on, 2021, to the persons who are Holders of record of the Notes on the preceding
and, respectively, whether or not a Business Day. Interest on the
Notes will accrue from the Issue Date and will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised
of twelve 30-day months.

If any interest payment date, Redemption Date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date
or any other date on which payment on any Notes is due is not a Business Day, the required payment
will be postponed and made on the next succeeding Business Day as if made on the date such
payment was due, and no interest will accrue on such payment for the period from and after such
interest payment date, Redemption Date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or
other date, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Business Day.
Interest on the Notes offered hereby will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has
been paid or duly provided for on the Notes or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for on
the Notes, from and including the Issue Date.

##### Transfer and exchange

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in
connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The
Company is not required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before the
mailing (or, if not mailed, other transmittal) of a notice of redemption of Notes.

##### Ranking

The Notes will be:

- senior unsecured obligations of the Company;

- pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and
senior unsecured guarantees of the Company;

- effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness
and secured guarantees of the Company to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
indebtedness and guarantees;

- senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness and subordinated
guarantees of the Company; and

- effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness, guarantees
and other liabilities (including trade payables) and any preferred equity of the Company’s
Subsidiaries (other than any Subsidiaries that may become Guarantors of the Notes as described
below).


-----

On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed by any of our Subsidiaries and none of our
Subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the Notes in the future, except under the circumstances
described under “—Possible Future Guarantees” below. In the event that any of our Subsidiaries
becomes a Guarantor of the Notes, its Guarantee of the Notes will be:

- a senior unsecured obligation of such Guarantor;

- pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and
senior unsecured guarantees of such Guarantor;

- effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness
and secured guarantees of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
indebtedness and guarantees; and

- senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness and subordinated
guarantees of such Guarantor.

As a holding company, substantially all of our business is conducted through our Subsidiaries,
which are separate and distinct legal entities and, except in the case of our Subsidiaries, if any,
that may guarantee the Notes in the future under the circumstances described below, have no
contractual or other obligations to make payments due on the Notes or to provide funds to us for
that purpose. Therefore, our ability to make payments due on the Notes and to meet our other
cash needs is dependent on the earnings of, and the distribution of funds (whether by dividend,
distribution, loan or otherwise) to us by, our Subsidiaries. The availability of funds from our
Subsidiaries will depend upon, among other things, their operating results, financial condition
and legal or contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and distributions or make loans
to us. We cannot assure you that our Subsidiaries will have sufficient funds, or that agreements
governing the existing and future indebtedness of our Subsidiaries will not restrict or prevent our
Subsidiaries from providing us with sufficient funds, to make payments on the Notes when due
and to meet our other cash needs, and the Indenture will not restrict our Subsidiaries from entering
into such restrictive agreements. Furthermore, we guarantee many of the obligations of our
subsidiaries and such guarantees may require us to provide substantial funds or assets to our
subsidiaries or their creditors at a time when we need liquidity to fund our own obligations, such
as the Notes. In addition, the Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all
existing and future indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities (including trade payables) and
preferred equity of our Subsidiaries (other than any Subsidiaries that may become Guarantors of
the Notes as described below). In that regard, certain of the Company’s Subsidiaries are borrowers
or guarantors under the Existing Credit Agreements and the Existing Repurchase Agreements and
the Notes will therefore be effectively subordinated in in right of payment to the indebtedness
of such Subsidiaries under the Existing Credit Agreements and the Existing Repurchase Agreements.
If any of our Subsidiaries guarantees the Notes, the terms of the Existing Convertible Senior
Notes require that such Subsidiary also guarantee the Existing Convertible Senior Notes, and we
may in the future enter into other debt instruments with similar requirements. In addition, the
Existing Senior Notes include a covenant substantially similar to the covenant described below
under “—Possible Future Guarantees,” which could require any of our Domestic Subsidiaries (other
than Excluded Subsidiaries and Securitization Entities) that guarantees the Notes offered hereby
to also guarantee the Existing Senior Notes. Furthermore, the Notes and any Guarantees of the
Notes by our Subsidiaries will be unsecured and therefore will not have the benefit of any
collateral. Accordingly, the Notes and any Guarantees of the Notes will be effectively subordinated
in right of payment to all existing and future secured Indebtedness and secured guarantees of
us and any Guarantors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured Indebtedness
and secured guarantees.

For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and to this Offering—
Our ability to repay our debt, including the Notes, depends on the performance of our subsidiaries


-----

and their ability to make distributions to us,” “—Risks Related to the Notes and to this Offering—
The Notes and any Guarantees will be unsecured and effectively subordinated in right of payment
to our existing and future secured indebtedness and secured guarantees to the extent of the value
of the assets securing such indebtedness and guarantees” and “—Risks Related to the Notes and
to this Offering—The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to the
indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities (including trade payables) and preferred equity of
our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and any of our subsidiaries that guarantees the
Notes will also be required to guarantee certain debt in addition to the Notes.”

##### Possible future guarantees

On the Issue Date, none of our Subsidiaries will be a Guarantor of the Notes. The Indenture will
provide that if, on any date (a “Guarantee Date”), the aggregate Guaranteed Principal Amount of
any Domestic Subsidiary of the Company (other than a Domestic Subsidiary of the Company that
is an Excluded Subsidiary or a Securitization Entity) exceeds $2.5 million, the Company will cause
such Domestic Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after such
Guarantee Date (except as set forth in the proviso below), a supplemental indenture pursuant to
which such Domestic Subsidiary will unconditionally guarantee the payment of the Notes, jointly
and severally with all other Guarantors (if any) of the Notes; provided that, if a Domestic
Subsidiary that would have been required to guarantee the Notes but for the fact that it was an
Excluded Subsidiary or a Securitization Entity shall be required to guarantee the Notes because it
shall have ceased to be an Excluded Subsidiary or a Securitization Entity, or if a Subsidiary that
was a Foreign Subsidiary shall be required to guarantee the Notes because it shall have become a
Domestic Subsidiary that is not an Excluded Subsidiary or a Securitization Entity, as the case may
be, the supplemental indenture referred to above shall be delivered to the Trustee within 30 days
after the date such Domestic Subsidiary shall have ceased to be an Excluded Subsidiary or a
Securitization Entity or such Foreign Subsidiary shall have become a Domestic Subsidiary that is
not an Excluded Subsidiary or Securitization Entity, as the case may be. Anything in the Indenture
to the contrary notwithstanding, no Excluded Subsidiary, Securitization Entity or Foreign
Subsidiary shall be required to guarantee the Notes or become a Guarantor.

The Indenture will provide that the covenant described in the immediately preceding paragraph
will automatically and permanently terminate and the Company will be automatically and
permanently released from all of its obligations under such covenant under the circumstances
described below under “—Certain Covenants—Covenant Termination” and, if that occurs, all
Guarantees (if any) of the Notes and all obligations of each Guarantor (if any) under its Guarantee
of the Notes and the Indenture will be automatically and permanently terminated and released.
For additional information, see “—Certain Covenants—Covenant Termination” below.

The Indenture will provide that the obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee of the
Notes will be limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the obligations of such Guarantor
under its Guarantee of the Notes constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer
under applicable federal, foreign or state laws. The Indenture will also provide that the limitation
described in the immediately preceding sentence shall survive any covenant termination described
below under “—Certain Covenants—Covenant Termination” and remain in full force and effect. By
virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee of the Notes could be
significantly less than amounts due and payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may
have no obligation under its Guarantee of the Notes. Moreover, this limitation may not be effective
to protect any Guarantees from being voided under fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer
or similar laws or to prevent that Guarantor’s obligation from being reduced to an amount that
effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and to
this Offering—Federal and state laws may permit courts, under specific circumstances, to void the
Notes and/or any Guarantees as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, subordinate claims in


-----

respect of the Notes and/or any Guarantees and require you to return payments received. If that
occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes or any Guarantees.” and “Risk Factors—
Risks Related to the Notes and to this Offering—If any of our Subsidiaries guarantees the Notes,
such Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantee may be reduced to zero, voided or released under
certain circumstances, and you may not receive any payments from some or all of the Guarantors.”

A Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Notes will automatically terminate and be released, all other
obligations of such Guarantor under the Indenture will automatically terminate and such
Guarantor will automatically be released from all of its obligations under its Guarantee of the
Notes and the Indenture:

(1) upon the sale or other disposition of Capital Stock of such Guarantor, or any merger or
consolidation of such Guarantor with or into any Person, which results in such Guarantor no
longer being a Subsidiary of the Company or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the
assets of such Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Domestic Subsidiary of the Company that
is not an Excluded Subsidiary or a Securitization Entity) so long as such sale, disposition, merger
or consolidation is permitted (or not prohibited) by the Indenture;

(2) upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers’ Certificate to the effect that such
Guarantor is an Excluded Subsidiary, a Securitization Entity or a Foreign Subsidiary (it being
understood that the Company may deliver such Officers’ Certificate in respect of any Domestic
Subsidiary that is a Guarantor if such Domestic Subsidiary subsequently becomes an Excluded
Subsidiary, a Securitization Entity or a Foreign Subsidiary);

(3) upon Legal Defeasance, Covenant Defeasance or discharge of the Notes as provided in
“—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” as applicable;

(4) if such Guarantor is dissolved or liquidated and such dissolution or liquidation is not an
Event of Default (excluding an Event of Default under clause (6) of the first paragraph under the
caption “—Events of Default”);

(5) upon the merger of such Guarantor into, or the consolidation of such Guarantor with, (a) a
Subsidiary of the Company if the surviving or resulting entity is an Excluded Subsidiary,
Securitization Entity or Foreign Subsidiary or (b) the Company or another Guarantor;

(6) if at any time the outstanding Guaranteed Principal Amount of such Guarantor (provided
that, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, any Debt Securities that would otherwise
be included in calculating such Guaranteed Principal Amount shall be excluded from such
calculation if (x) such Guarantor’s guarantee of such Debt Securities will be released, terminated,
suspended or discharged, (y) such Debt Securities will be repaid, repurchased, defeased, redeemed
or otherwise discharged or otherwise will cease to be outstanding or (z) such Debt Securities will
cease to meet the requirements for inclusion under clause (a), (b), (c), or (d) of the definition of
“Guaranteed Principal Amount,” in each case contemporaneously with the termination of such
Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Notes) shall be less than or equal to $2.5 million, whether as a result
of the release, termination, suspension or discharge of such Guarantor’s guarantee of any Debt
Securities, the repayment, repurchase, defeasance, redemption or other discharge of any Debt
Securities, the release, termination, suspension or discharge of the Company’s guarantee of any
Guaranteed Subsidiary Debt Securities, or otherwise;

(7) under the circumstances described in the last paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—
Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” or if such Guarantor shall cease to be a Subsidiary of
the Company; or

(8) under the circumstances described under “—Certain Covenants—Covenant Termination”
below.


-----

Our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts
due on the Notes or to make any funds available to the Company to pay those amounts, whether
by dividend, distribution, loan or otherwise. See “—Ranking” above and “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Notes and to this Offering—The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of
payment to the indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities (including trade payables) and
preferred equity of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and any of our subsidiaries
that guarantees the Notes will also be required to guarantee certain debt in addition to the Notes.”

##### Optional redemption

Prior to, (the “Par Call Date”), the Notes may be redeemed in whole or in
part at the Company’s option at any time and from time to time at a price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued but unpaid interest, if
any, to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date (subject to the right of the Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on any interest payment date falling
on or prior to such Redemption Date).

On and after the Par Call Date, the Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at the Company’s
option at any time and from time to time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption
Date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on any interest payment date falling on or prior to such Redemption Date).

Prior to,, the Company will be entitled at its option on one or
more occasions to redeem the Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes) originally issued prior to
the applicable Redemption Date at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of the principal
amount of the Notes to be redeemed) of %, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to,
but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on any interest payment date falling on or prior to
such Redemption Date), with the Net Cash Proceeds from one or more Qualified Equity Offerings;
provided, however, that:

(1) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes (including any Additional Notes)
originally issued prior to the applicable Redemption Date remains outstanding immediately after
the occurrence of each such redemption (other than Notes held, directly or indirectly, by the
Company or any of its Affiliates); and

(2) each such redemption occurs within 180 days after the date of the closing of the related
Qualified Equity Offering.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer or Change of Control Offer
for the Notes, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such offer and the Company, or
any third party making an offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right,
upon not less than 15 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 60 days
following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such
purchase at a price in cash equal to the price offered to each other Holder of the Notes in such
offer (which may be less than par) plus, to the extent not included in the offer payment, accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date).


-----

Any redemption of the Notes may, in the Company’s sole discretion, be subject to one or more
conditions precedent, which shall be described in the related notice of redemption to Holders of
Notes, which conditions may include, without limitation, completion of one or more Qualified
Equity Offerings or other securities offerings or other financings, transactions or events. If such
redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice to Holders
of Notes may (at the option of the Company) include a statement to the effect that the
Redemption Date may be delayed, on one or more occasions and in the Company’s sole discretion,
either (at the Company’s option) to a date specified by the Company in such notice or in a
subsequent notice to such Holders (subject, if the Company shall so elect, to satisfaction of any or
all such conditions or the Company’s written waiver of any such conditions that are not satisfied)
or until such time as any or all of such conditions have been satisfied or waived by the Company in
writing, and that, if any such conditions shall not have been satisfied as and when required (as
determined by the Company in its sole discretion and taking into account any election by the
Company to delay such Redemption Date), then (unless the Company shall have waived in writing
any such conditions that are not satisfied), the Company shall have no obligation to redeem the
Notes called for redemption on such Redemption Date (as the same may have been delayed by the
Company as aforesaid) and may cancel such proposed redemption and rescind any notice of
such redemption. In order to delay any Redemption Date (or to further delay any delayed
Redemption Date (as defined below)), the Company shall provide written notice to the Trustee,
at least two Business Days before such Redemption Date (or such delayed Redemption Date, as the
case may be), to the effect that the Company has elected to delay such Redemption Date (or
such delayed Redemption Date, as the case may be) and specifying the new Redemption Date (a
“delayed Redemption Date”) (which may, at the Company’s option, be specified as the date on
which any or all conditions to such redemption are satisfied (as determined by the Company in
its sole discretion) or waived by the Company), and the Trustee shall provide such notice to each
Holder of the Notes that were to be redeemed in the same manner in which the notice of
redemption was given. The Company may delay any Redemption Date on one or more occasions.

If all conditions precedent (if any) to any redemption of the Notes shall not have been satisfied
as and when required (as determined by the Company in its sole discretion and taking into account
any election by the Company to delay such Redemption Date) or waived by the Company in
writing and the Company has not elected to delay (or further delay) the applicable Redemption
Date (or the applicable delayed Redemption Date, as the case may be), the Company shall provide
written notice to the effect that the Company has elected to cancel such redemption to the
Trustee prior to close of business two Business Days prior to such Redemption Date (or such delayed
Redemption Date, as the case may be). Upon the Trustee’s receipt of such notice, the notice of
such redemption shall be automatically rescinded and such redemption shall be automatically
cancelled and the Company shall have no obligation to redeem the Notes called for redemption.
Promptly after receipt of such notice, the Trustee shall provide such notice to each Holder of the
Notes that were to have been redeemed in the same manner in which the notice of redemption
was given.

“Applicable Premium” means, with respect to any Note on any Redemption Date for such Note,
the greater of: (1) 1.0% of the principal amount of such Note and (2) the excess, if any, of (a) the
present value as of such Redemption Date of (i) the redemption price of such Note on the Par
Call Date (such redemption price being 100% of the principal amount of such Note) plus (ii) all
required remaining scheduled interest payments due on such Note to, but excluding, the Par Call
Date, excluding accrued but unpaid interest to such Redemption Date, computed using a
discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus basis points, over (b) the principal
amount of such Note. Calculation of the Applicable Premium and the Treasury Rate will be made
by the Company or on behalf of the Company by such Person as the Company shall designate;
provided, however, that such calculation shall not be a duty or obligation of the Trustee.


-----

“Treasury Rate” means, with respect to a Redemption Date for any Note, the average of the
yields to maturity (for each Business Day during the most recent week that has ended at least two
Business Days prior to the first day on which the Company mails or otherwise transmits the
notice of redemption (or, in the case of redemption in connection with Legal Defeasance, Covenant
Defeasance or satisfaction and discharge as described below under “—Legal Defeasance and
Covenant Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” as applicable, at least two Business Days
prior to the deposit of trust funds with the Trustee in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Indenture)) of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and
published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or, if such Statistical Release is
no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the
Company)) most nearly equal to the period from such Redemption Date to the Par Call Date;
provided, however, that if such period is not equal to the constant maturity of the United States
Treasury security for which a yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear
interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the yields of United States
Treasury securities for which such yields are given, except that if such period is less than one year,
the yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of
one year shall be used.

In the event that the Company chooses to redeem less than all of the Notes, selection of the
Notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee pro rata or by lot; provided that, in the case of
Notes represented by one or more Global Notes, interests in such Global Notes will be selected
for redemption by the Depositary in accordance with its applicable procedures therefor.

Notes shall be redeemed in a minimum principal amount of $2,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof; provided that the remaining principal amount of any Note redeemed in
part shall be $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notice of redemption
will be mailed by first-class mail, or, if the Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes and
if the Depositary’s applicable procedures so provide, transmitted in accordance with the
Depositary’s applicable procedures therefor, at least 15 but not more than 60 days before the
Redemption Date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed at its registered address (or at such
address as may be provided by the Depositary’s applicable procedures). On and after the
Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption
as long as the Company has deposited with the paying agent funds in satisfaction of the applicable
redemption price.

##### Mandatory redemption; open market and other purchases

Except as described below under “—Change of Control,” we will not be required to make any
mandatory redemption, mandatory repurchase or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
We may at any time and from time to time acquire Notes by means other than a redemption,
whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in
accordance with applicable securities laws.

##### Change of control

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, each Holder of Notes will have the
right (unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described under
“—Optional Redemption” above by sending a notice of redemption) to require that the Company
purchase all or a portion of such Holder’s Notes pursuant to the offer described below (a “Change
of Control Offer”) at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof
plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable Change of Control Payment
Date referred to below (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on any interest payment date falling on or prior to the Change of Control
Payment Date (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”).


-----

Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have
occurred, the Company must (unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all of the
Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” above by sending a notice of redemption)
send, by first class mail, a notice to each Holder of Notes (or, in the case of Global Notes, send such
notice in accordance with the applicable procedures, if any, of the Depositary), with a copy to
the Trustee, which notice shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice shall
state:

- that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the Indenture and that all Notes
that are validly tendered and not withdrawn will be accepted for payment;

- the Change of Control Purchase Price and the purchase date, which must be a Business Day no
earlier than 15 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (or otherwise
transmitted), other than as may be required by law (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

- that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

- that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to
accrue interest on and after the Change of Control Payment Date (unless the Company shall
default in the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price of the Notes) and the only
remaining right of the Holder will be to receive payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price
upon surrender of the applicable Note to the paying agent;

- that Holders electing to have a portion of a Note purchased pursuant to a Change of Control
Offer may only elect to have such Note purchased in denominations of $2,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, provided that the remaining principal amount of any such
Note surrendered for repurchase in part shall be $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in
excess thereof;

- that if a Holder elects to have a Note purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer it will
be required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase”
on the reverse of the Note duly completed, to the Person and at the address specified in the
notice (or, in the case of Global Notes, to surrender the Note and provide the information
required by such form in accordance with the applicable procedures, if any, of the Depositary)
prior to the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment
Date;

- that a Holder will be entitled to withdraw its election if the Company receives, not later than
the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date,
a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of such Holder, the principal amount of
Notes such Holder delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its
election to have such Notes purchased; and

- that if any Note is purchased only in part a new Note will be issued in principal amount equal
to the unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered.

On or before the Change of Control Payment Date for the Notes, the Company will, to the extent
lawful:

- accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes (in denominations of $2,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer, provided that if, following repurchase of a portion of a Note, the
remaining principal amount thereof would be less than $2,000, then the portion of such Note so
repurchased shall be reduced so that the remaining principal amount of such Note outstanding
immediately after such repurchase is $2,000;

- deposit with a paying agent an amount equal to the payment due in respect of all Notes or
portions thereof so tendered and not withdrawn;


-----

- deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted for
payment; and

- deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were
accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Indenture.

The Company, the depositary, if any, appointed by the Company for such Change of Control
Offer or a paying agent, as the case may be, shall promptly mail or deliver (or, in the case of Global
Notes, deliver in accordance with the applicable procedures, if any, of the Depositary) to each
tendering Holder an amount equal to the Change of Control Purchase Price of the Notes validly
tendered by such Holder and not withdrawn and accepted by the Company for purchase. Further,
the Company shall promptly issue a new Note, and the Trustee, upon written request from the
Company, shall authenticate and mail or deliver (including by book-entry transfer) such new Note
to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note accepted
for payment (it being understood that, notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary,
no Officers’ Certificate or opinion of counsel will be required for the Trustee to authenticate
and mail or deliver any such new Note). Any Note not so accepted shall be promptly mailed or
delivered (including by book-entry transfer) by the Company or the Trustee to the Holder thereof.

Interest on Notes (or portions thereof) validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to a Change
of Control Offer will cease to accrue on and after the applicable Change of Control Payment
Date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price
of the Notes).

If the Change of Control Payment Date is on or after a record date and on or before the related
interest payment date for the Notes, any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to, but excluding,
the Change of Control Payment Date will be paid to the Persons in whose names the applicable
Notes are registered at the close of business on the applicable record date.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer for the Notes upon a
Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the
manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture
that are applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything
in the Indenture to the contrary, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change
of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event conditioned upon the occurrence of such a
Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement regarding such
Change of Control is in effect at the time of making the Change of Control Offer.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are
applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To
the extent that any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture
relating to a Change of Control Offer, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under such provisions
of the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event (including the definitions
relating thereto) and the terms of any such offer may, subject to the limitations described below
under “—Modification of the Notes, any Guarantees or the Indenture,” be waived or modified with
the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes.


-----

The provisions described above may deter certain mergers, tender offers and other takeover
attempts involving the Company by increasing the capital required to effectuate such transactions.

The Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Notes may not provide Holders of
Notes protection in the event of highly leveraged transactions, reorganizations, restructurings,
takeovers, acquisitions, mergers, recapitalizations or similar transactions involving us that might
adversely affect holders of Notes. In particular, any such transaction may not give rise to a Change
of Control Triggering Event, in which case we would not be required to make a Change of
Control Offer. Except as described above, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit
the Holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of highly leveraged transactions, reorganizations, restructurings, takeovers, acquisitions, mergers,
recapitalizations or similar transactions involving us.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
assets (subject to certain exceptions) of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any
Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of such assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering
Event has occurred and whether the Company is required to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as described above.

More generally, courts interpreting change of control provisions under New York law (which is
the governing law of the Notes and the Indenture) have not provided a clear and consistent
meaning of such change of control provisions, and no assurance can be given as to how or if a court
would enforce the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions applicable to the Notes or
how those provisions would be impacted were we to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case.

We may be unable to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event because
we may not have sufficient funds available or we may be prohibited from doing so by the terms of
our other indebtedness. In that regard, the Existing Senior Notes include a covenant substantially
similar to the covenant applicable to the Notes as described under this caption “—Change of
Control.” In addition, a transaction constituting a Change of Control Triggering Event, Change of
Control or similar event and certain other events or transactions relating to, for example, the
composition of our board of directors, our adoption of a plan for liquidation or dissolution, a
change in control in the Manager or the Manager ceasing to be our manager, constitute or may
constitute events of default or require or may require us to repay or offer to repurchase or repay
outstanding indebtedness under other existing or future credit agreements, repurchase
agreements, indentures or other instruments or agreements relating to indebtedness to which
we or any of our subsidiaries is or becomes a party. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will
have sufficient financial resources available to repurchase or repay Notes or other indebtedness
should we be required to do so upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event,
Change of Control or other event or transaction. Any failure to repurchase or repay any existing of
future indebtedness, should it become due and payable as the result of a Change of Control
Triggering Event, Change of Control or other event, would likely have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could result in the acceleration
of other indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries pursuant to cross-default and cross-acceleration
provisions. In addition, certain existing or future indebtedness of ours and our subsidiaries
requires or may require us or our subsidiaries to repay or offer to repurchase such indebtedness
upon the occurrence of certain changes of control or similar events which may not constitute a
Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the


-----

Notes and to this Offering—Our ability to repurchase Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering
Event may be limited.”

Moreover, we will be required to offer to repurchase Notes only if both a Change of Control and
certain declines in the credit ratings on the Notes occur. By contrast, any requirement that we
repurchase or repay or offer to repurchase or repay, as applicable, indebtedness outstanding under
the Existing Repurchase Agreements, the Existing Convertible Senior Notes or the Existing Credit
Agreements upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (or similar event) or certain other events
relating to, for example, certain changes in the composition of our board of directors, our
adoption of a plan of liquidation or dissolution, a change in control in the Manager or the Manager
ceasing to be our manager, will arise, in each case, without any requirement that there also be a
decline in our credit rating, and other existing and future instruments and agreements relating to
indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries may have similar provisions. As a result, we may be
required to repay or repurchase or offer to repay or repurchase indebtedness outstanding under
the Existing Repurchase Agreements, the Existing Convertible Senior Notes, the Existing Credit
Agreements and other existing and future instruments and agreements relating to indebtedness
before we are required, or without our being required, to repurchase or offer to repurchase the
Notes.

##### Certain covenants

**_Covenant termination_**

The Indenture will contain the provisions described above under “—Possible Future Guarantees”
and below under this “—Certain Covenants” section. However, the Indenture will provide that the
provisions described above under “—Possible Future Guarantees” (other than the portions of
such covenant limiting the obligations of each Guarantor (if any) under its Guarantee of the Notes
as described in the third paragraph under such caption and the portions of such covenant
relating to the release of any Guarantor from its Guarantee of the Notes as described in the
fourth paragraph under such caption) and the provisions described below under “—Limitation on
Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness” and clauses (2) and (4) of the first paragraph under
“—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” (collectively, the “Terminated Covenants”) will
automatically and permanently terminate and will be of no further force or effect, and the
Company will be automatically and permanently released from all of its obligations thereunder,
on and after any date (the “Covenant Termination Date”) that (a) the Notes have an Investment
Grade Rating from both Rating Agencies and (b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing with respect to the Notes, and thereafter any omission to comply with any of
the Terminated Covenants (or the Guarantees, if any, of the Notes, which Guarantees also shall be
automatically and permanently terminated and released as provided below) shall not constitute
a breach, Default or Event of Default under the Notes or the Indenture.

All of the Guarantees, if any, of the Notes will automatically and permanently terminate and will
be of no further force or effect, and all of the obligations of the Guarantors, if any, under such
Guarantees and the Indenture will be automatically and permanently released, on the Covenant
Termination Date.

The Indenture will provide that the Company shall deliver an Officers’ Certificate to the Trustee
notifying the Trustee of the Covenant Termination Date promptly (but in no event later than ten
Business Days) after such date, and that the Trustee shall have no obligation to monitor or
determine whether a Covenant Termination Date has occurred, provided that any failure by the
Company to deliver any such Officers’ Certificate shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default
or affect the automatic and permanent termination of the Terminated Covenants, Guarantees
(if any) of the Notes and other obligations described above on the Covenant Termination Date.


-----

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever receive an Investment Grade Rating from any
Rating Agency or, if they do, that such rating will be maintained.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable for payment
of (collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness (including, without limitation, Acquired Indebtedness)
other than Permitted Indebtedness and other than as provided in the next paragraph.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness
(including, without limitation, Acquired Indebtedness) if, on the date of the incurrence of such
Indebtedness and immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the
repayment, repurchase, defeasance, redemption or other discharge of any other Indebtedness
with the proceeds of the Indebtedness being so incurred or in connection with the transactions
pursuant to which such Indebtedness is being incurred, on a pro forma basis:

(1) the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company is greater than 1.5 to 1.0; and

(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a
consequence of incurring such Indebtedness.

**_Maintenance of Total Unencumbered Assets_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company will maintain Total Unencumbered Assets of not
less than 120% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Unsecured Indebtedness of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case determined on a consolidated basis in accordance
with GAAP.

**_Merger, consolidation and sale of assets_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, consolidate or merge with or into any Person, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company’s properties and assets determined
on a consolidated basis (other than sales, assignments, transfers, leases, conveyances or other
dispositions of Securitization Assets, Repurchase Agreement Assets, Investments or other securities
or assets, in each case in the ordinary course of business) to any Person, unless:

(1) either

(a) the Company shall be the surviving or continuing Person; or

(b) the Person (if other than the Company) formed by such consolidation or into which the
Company is merged or the Person which acquires by sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition all or substantially all of the Company’s properties and assets
(the “Surviving Entity”):

(i) shall be an entity organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States or
any State thereof or the District of Columbia; and

(ii) shall expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the
Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and
interest on all of the Notes and the performance of every covenant in the Notes and the
Indenture on the part of the Company to be performed or observed;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and, if applicable, the assumption
contemplated by clause (1)(b)(ii) above (including giving pro forma effect to any Indebtedness


-----

and Acquired Indebtedness incurred and any repayment, repurchase, defeasance, redemption or
other discharge of Indebtedness by the Company or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with such transaction), the Company or such
Surviving Entity, as the case may be: (a) shall have a Consolidated Net Worth equal to or greater
than the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company immediately prior to such transaction, in each
case determined as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter ending on or prior to the date
of such transaction for which financial statements of the Company or the Surviving Entity, as the
case may be, are available; or (b) shall be able to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness
pursuant to the second paragraph of the “—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness”
covenant; or (c) shall have a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio that is equal to or greater
than the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company immediately prior to such
transaction (the computations required by clauses (b) and (c) above shall be computed on a
pro forma basis giving effect to such transaction as if it had occurred at the beginning of the
most recent Four Quarter Period ended on or prior to the date of such transaction for which
financial statements of the Company or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, are available and
the other pro forma adjustments set forth in the definition of Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio). If the transaction involves a Surviving Entity and the Company and the Surviving
Entity have different fiscal quarters, then the relevant Four Quarter Period and, for purposes of
clause (a) of this paragraph (2), the relevant fiscal quarter, may, at the election of the Company, be
based on either the Company’s or the Surviving Entity’s fiscal quarters;

(3) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness
that becomes an obligation of the Company or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having been incurred by the Company or the
Surviving Entity, as the case may be, or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction, and any
Indebtedness to be repaid, repurchased, defeased, redeemed or otherwise discharged by the
Company or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with such
transaction as having been repaid, repurchased, defeased, redeemed or otherwise discharged
at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing;

(4) if the Surviving Entity is not the Company, each Guarantor (unless it is the Surviving Entity, in
which case clause (1)(b) above shall apply) shall have by supplemental indenture confirmed that its
Guarantee of the Notes shall apply to such Surviving Entity’s obligations under the Indenture
and the Notes; and

(5) the Company or the Surviving Entity shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate
and an opinion of counsel (which opinion may be subject to customary assumptions, limitations
and exceptions), each stating that such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with
such transaction, such supplemental indenture comply with the applicable provisions of the
Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets”
covenant, any Subsidiary of the Company may merge or consolidate with or into or transfer all or
any part of its properties and assets to the Company or the Surviving Entity or any other Subsidiary
of the Company or the Surviving Entity and the foregoing provisions and, except in the case of a
merger or consolidation with or into the Company or the Surviving Entity, the last paragraph of
this “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” covenant shall not apply to any such transaction.

The Indenture will provide that, for purposes of the foregoing, the sale, assignment, transfer,
lease, conveyance or other disposition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the


-----

Company (other than sales, assignments, transfers, leases, conveyances or other dispositions of
Securitization Assets, Repurchase Agreement Assets, Investments or other securities or assets, in
each case in the ordinary course of business), the Capital Stock of which constitutes all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be
deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.

The Indenture will provide that, for purposes of clarity, it is understood and agreed that references
under this caption “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” to sales, assignments, transfers,
leases, conveyances or other dispositions of Securitization Assets, Repurchase Agreement Assets,
Investments or other securities or assets in the ordinary course of business shall include, without
limitation, any sales, assignments, transfers, leases, conveyances or other dispositions of
Securitization Assets, Repurchase Agreement Assets, Investments or other securities or assets
(1) that are made (x) to any Securitization Entity for the purpose of enabling such Securitization
Entity to securitize the assets so sold, assigned, transferred, leased, conveyed or disposed of or
enabling such Securitization Entity to issue Non-Recourse Indebtedness secured by such assets
or to enter into any Repurchase Agreements with respect to such assets or (y) to any Person
pursuant to a Repurchase Agreement that is otherwise permitted (or not prohibited) by the
Indenture, under which such Person is a buyer of Repurchase Agreement Assets, and (2) that the
Company in good faith determines to be consistent with past practice of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or to reflect customary or accepted practice in the businesses, industries or markets
in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries operates or reasonably expects to operate or that
reflect reasonable extensions, evolutions or developments of any of the foregoing (including,
without limitation, by way of new transactions or structures), and as a result, none of the foregoing
shall constitute a sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the Company’s properties and assets, on a consolidated basis or otherwise, for
purposes of the other paragraphs under this caption “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of
Assets.” The Indenture will provide that upon any consolidation or merger or any sale, assignment,
transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or
assets of the Company in accordance with the foregoing in which the Company is not the surviving
or continuing entity, as the case may be, the Surviving Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted
for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the Indenture and the Notes
with the same effect as if such Surviving Entity had been named as the “Company” therein, and
the Company shall be released from all of its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes;
provided that, in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
Company, the Company will not be released from its obligation to pay the principal of and
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes.

The Indenture will further provide that, if the Surviving Entity in any transaction described in,
and made in compliance with, this “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” section shall be
a Guarantor of the Notes, or if a Guarantor shall merge or consolidate with or into the Company or
the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, in any transaction described in, and made in compliance
with this “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” section, such Guarantor’s Guarantee of the
Notes will automatically terminate and be released and such Guarantor will automatically be
released from all of its obligations under its Guarantee of the Notes and all of its obligations as a
Guarantor under the Indenture contemporaneously with such transaction.


-----

**_Reports to holders_**

The Indenture will provide that, whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC
and so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will mail or otherwise transmit to the
Holders of the outstanding Notes:

(1) all quarterly and annual financial information that would be required to be contained in
Items 6, 7, 7A and 8 of Part II of a filing with the SEC on Form 10-K and Items 1, 2, and 3 of Part I
of a filing with the SEC on Form 10-Q, as applicable, if the Company were required to file such forms
pursuant to the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
and, with respect to the annual information only, a report on the Company’s annual financial
statements by the Company’s independent public accounting firm, in each case within 15 days after
the last day of the applicable time period for filing with the SEC (plus any applicable extensions
of such time period) specified in the relevant form or in the rules and regulations of the SEC or any
other applicable laws, rules or regulations; and

(2) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if the Company
were required to file such reports pursuant to the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder, in each case within three Business Days after the last day of
the applicable time period for filing with the SEC (plus any applicable extensions of such time
period) specified in Form 8-K or in the rules and regulations of the SEC or any other applicable laws,
rules or regulations; provided, however, that no such report will be required to be furnished to
the extent such report would be required by Items 1.04, 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 5.02(e), 5.03, 5.04, 5.05,
5.06, 5.07 or 5.08 of Form 8-K;

provided, however, that, in the event that the Company is not subject to the reporting
requirements of Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, (i) the time periods for filing of the
foregoing information and reports (collectively, the “Financial Reports”) specified in the relevant
forms or rules and regulations of the SEC or any other applicable laws, rules or regulations as
described in clauses (1) and (2) above shall be those applicable to a non-accelerated filer or shall
otherwise be the longest available time period under such forms, rules and regulations of the SEC
or other applicable laws, rules or regulations, as the case may be, (plus any applicable extensions
of such time period), and (ii) the Financial Reports (A) will not be required to comply with
Section 302 or Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 and 308 of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K or Regulation G (with
respect to any non-GAAP financial measures contained therein) promulgated by the SEC, (B) will
not be required to include information required by Item 601 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the
SEC, (C) will not be required to include financial statements for any acquired entity, businesses
or assets (whether acquired by merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets or Capital Stock or
otherwise) unless such acquisition has occurred and such financial statements would be required by
Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC to be included in an annual report on Form
10-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q or current report on Form 8-K of the Company, as the case may
be, provided that, notwithstanding that such Rule 3-05 or any other law, rule or regulation
would require that some or all of such financial statements be audited, the Company may
nonetheless deliver unaudited financial statements unless the Company shall have obtained such
audited financial statements in connection with such acquisition, and provided, further, that the
Company shall in no event be required to provide any financial statements as of dates or for
periods earlier or other than the dates or periods that would otherwise be required by such
Rule 3-05 for any such acquisition, and (D) will not be required to include the schedules identified
in Rule 5-04 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC. For purposes of clarity, it is understood
and agreed that (x) the Company may, in its sole discretion, include in any of the Financial Reports
information in addition to that specified in clauses (1) and (2) above and any information that it
would otherwise be entitled to omit pursuant to the provisions described above, and (y) no financial


-----

statements shall be required for the acquisition or disposition of any entity, business or assets
(whether acquired or disposed of by merger, consolidation, acquisition or disposition of assets or
Capital Stock or otherwise) unless such acquisition or disposition, as the case may be, shall have
occurred.

In addition, the Indenture will provide that the Company and the Guarantors, if any, will agree to
make available to Holders of any outstanding Notes and to prospective purchasers designated
by such Holders, upon request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act so long as such Notes (other than Notes held by the Company or an
“affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Company) are not freely
transferable under the Securities Act.

The Indenture will provide that, if the Company is a Subsidiary of any direct or indirect parent
entity, the Financial Reports required pursuant to the first paragraph of this “Reports to Holders”
section may be those of such parent entity instead of the Company; provided that, if there are
material differences (as determined in good faith by the Company) between the consolidated
results of operations and financial condition of such parent entity and its consolidated Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, on the other hand, the
quarterly and annual Financial Reports required by the first paragraph above will include a
presentation (which may be unaudited), either on the face of the financial statements or in the
notes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (it being understood and agreed that such presentation may take the form of a
condensed consolidating statement of operations and a condensed consolidating balance sheet
(in each case without notes thereto) or a presentation similar to that required by Rule 3-10 of
Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC (whether or not such rule is applicable) for the applicable
periods).

Anything in the Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be deemed to
have satisfied its obligation to mail, transmit or otherwise furnish any Financial Report or other
information pursuant to the first paragraph and the immediately preceding paragraph of this
“—Reports to Holders” section by (a) filing or furnishing such Financial Report or other information
(or another document containing the information that would otherwise have been included in
such Financial Report or containing such other information, as applicable) with the SEC for public
availability or (b) posting such Financial Report or other information (or another document
containing the information that would otherwise have been included in such Financial Report or
containing such other information) on a website (which may be a password protected website)
hosted by the Company or by a third party, in each case within the applicable time period
specified above.

The Indenture will provide that, if any Financial Report or other information required by this
“—Reports to Holders” section (or any other document referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph) is not filed, mailed, posted, transmitted or otherwise furnished within the applicable
time period specified above and such Financial Report or other information (or other document)
is subsequently mailed, filed, posted, transmitted or otherwise furnished, the Company will be
deemed to have satisfied its obligations under this “—Reports to Holders” section with respect
to such Financial Report or other information (or other document), as the case may be, and any
Default or Event of Default with respect thereto or resulting therefrom shall be deemed to have
been cured and any acceleration of the Notes resulting therefrom shall be deemed to have been
rescinded so long as such rescission would not conflict with any applicable judgment or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction.


-----

##### Events of default

The following events will be defined in the Indenture as “Events of Default” with respect to the
Notes:

(1) the failure to pay interest on any Notes when the same becomes due and payable and the
default continues for a period of 30 days;

(2) the failure to pay the principal of and premium, if any, on any Notes when such principal
becomes due and payable, at maturity or otherwise (including the failure to make a payment to
purchase Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to a Change of Control Offer);

(3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply with any of its other covenants or
agreements contained in the Indenture (other than covenants or agreements a default in whose
performance would constitute an Event of Default under clause (1) or (2) above) and such default
continues for a period of 60 days after the Company receives written notice (with a copy to the
Trustee if given by Holders) specifying the default (and demanding that such default be remedied)
from the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% of the outstanding principal amount of the
Notes (except in the case of a default with respect to the “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of
Assets” covenant, which will constitute an Event of Default when the Company receives the written
notice specified in this clause (3) (with a copy to the Trustee if given by Holders) but without any
requirement that such default continue for 60 days);

(4) the failure to pay at final stated maturity (giving effect to any applicable grace periods and
any extensions thereof) the principal amount of any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than
Non-Recourse Indebtedness) of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and such payment
shall not have been made, waived or extended within 30 days after such final stated maturity
(giving effect to any applicable grace periods and any extensions thereof) (a “Payment Default”),
or the acceleration of the final stated maturity of any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other
than Non-Recourse Indebtedness) of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and such
acceleration shall not have been rescinded, annulled, waived or otherwise cured within 30 days
after receipt by the Company or such Subsidiary of the Company of written notice of any such
acceleration (an “Acceleration”), if the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness, together
with the aggregate principal amount of any other Indebtedness for borrowed money (other
than Non-Recourse Indebtedness) of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as to which
a Payment Default or an Acceleration shall have occurred and shall be continuing, aggregates
$170.0 million or more at any time;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy affecting the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries; or

(6) any Guarantee of the Notes by a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary of the Company
ceases (or the Guarantees of the Notes by a group of Guarantors that together would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary of the Company cease) to be in full force and effect for a period of 30 days,
or a Guarantor of the Notes that is a Significant Subsidiary of the Company (or a group of
Guarantors of the Notes that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Company)
denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guarantee (or their obligations under their
Guarantees, as the case may be) of the Notes unless such denial or disaffirmation, as applicable, is
rescinded, canceled or terminated within 30 days, in each case other than by reason of the
release, termination or discharge of any such Guarantees or Guarantors in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture or as a result of the discharge of the Indenture as described below under
“—Satisfaction and Discharge” or as a result of Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance as
described below under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.”

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (5) above with respect to
the Company) shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in


-----

aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and accrued and
unpaid interest on all the outstanding Notes to be due and payable by notice in writing to the
Company and (if the notice is given by Holders) to the Trustee specifying the Event of Default and
that it is a “notice of acceleration,” and the same shall become immediately due and payable. If
an Event of Default specified in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is
continuing, then all unpaid principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the outstanding
Notes shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or
other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.

A notice of Default may not be given by the Trustee with respect to any action taken, and
reported publicly or to Holders more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of
Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default,
notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or
more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation
from each such Holder delivered to the Company and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in
the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial
owners of the Notes that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation,
in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default (a “Default
Direction”) shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is
cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder
is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company
with such other information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to
verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days
of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its
nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be
provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering
its direction to the Trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the
Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder
was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent
jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its
Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the
applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically
stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically
reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court
of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction,
but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with
respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event
of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically
reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any
breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder
Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of
Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been
insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be
void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred,
acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder
Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default.


-----

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder
Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default described in
clause (5) above shall not require compliance with the preceding two paragraphs.

The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in
accordance with the Indenture that is accompanied by the required Position Representations, and
shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation,
enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officers’ Certificate
delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to
Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or
otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Company, any holder or any other Person in
acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction that is accompanied by the required Position
Representations or on an Officers’ Certificate from the Company, in either case, pursuant to which
the Trustee refrains from taking any action or stays any remedy in good faith with respect
thereto or in reliance thereon.

The Indenture will provide that, at any time after an acceleration with respect to Notes as
described in the preceding paragraph, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes may rescind and cancel such acceleration and its consequences:

(1) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction;

(2) if all existing Events of Default, other than nonpayment of principal of or interest on the
Notes that have become due solely because of the acceleration, have been cured or waived;

(3) if, to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of
interest and overdue principal, in each case which have become due otherwise than by such
acceleration, at a per annum rate equal to the interest rate per annum borne by the Notes, has been
paid; and

(4) if the Company has paid the Trustee its reasonable compensation and reimbursed the Trustee
for its reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of
Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph under this caption “—Events of Default” has
occurred and is continuing, the acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically rescinded and
cancelled if (a) within 60 days after such acceleration of the Notes as a result of such Event of
Default, the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than NonRecourse Indebtedness) of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as to which a Payment
Default or an Acceleration shall have occurred and shall be continuing shall be less than
$170.0 million, whether as a result of any such Payment Default or Payment Defaults or
Acceleration or Accelerations, as the case may be, having been remedied or cured or waived by
the holders of the relevant Indebtedness, the relevant Indebtedness having been repaid, redeemed,
defeased or otherwise discharged, or otherwise, (b) the rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (c) all existing Events of Default, other
than nonpayment of the principal of or interest on the Notes that shall have become due solely
because of the acceleration, have been cured or waived.

No rescission of acceleration of the Notes pursuant to the provisions described in the two
immediately preceding paragraphs shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right
consequent thereto.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may waive, by their
consent (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or


-----

tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes), any Default or Event of Default and its
consequences, except a continuing default in the payment of the principal, premium, if any, or
interest on any Notes held by any non-consenting Holder (excluding a default in payment resulting
from an acceleration that has been or is being waived or rescinded or that has been cured).

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes or any Guarantees of the Notes
except as provided in the Indenture and the TIA. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture
relating to the duties of the Trustee if a default occurs, the Trustee is under no obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request, order or direction of any
of the Holders of the Notes, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee. Subject to all provisions of the Indenture and
applicable law, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee under
the Indenture.

Under the Indenture, the Company is required to provide an Officers’ Certificate to the Trustee
promptly upon any Senior Officer of the Company obtaining knowledge of any Default or Event
of Default, and is also required to provide an annual Officers’ Certificate indicating whether or not
the officers signing such certificate know of any Default or Event of Default under the Indenture
and, if applicable, describing such Default or Event of Default and the status thereof.

##### Legal defeasance and covenant defeasance

The Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and the obligations
of all Guarantors, if any, discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes (“Legal Defeasance”).
Such Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the
entire indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes, the Guarantors, if any, shall be
released from all of their obligations under the Indenture and their Guarantees of the Notes, and
the Company shall be released from all of its other obligations under the Indenture and the
Notes, except that the following provisions of the Indenture shall survive:

(1) the rights of Holders to receive, solely from the trust fund described below, payments in
respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes when such payments are
due;

(2) the Company’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office
or agency for payments on the Notes;

(3) the rights, powers, trust, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the Company’s obligations
in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the
Company and the Guarantors, if any, under the Indenture released with respect to, among other
things, the covenants described above under the captions “—Possible Future Guarantees,”
“—Change of Control,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional
Indebtedness,” “—Certain Covenants—Maintenance of Total Unencumbered Assets,” “—Certain
Covenants—Reports to Holders” and clauses (2) and (4) of the first paragraph under “—Certain
Covenants—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter
any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default. In
the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, (x) the Events of Default described in clauses (1) and
(2) (solely insofar as such clauses relate to any failure to pay amounts due in connection with a


-----

Change of Control Offer), clause (3) (solely insofar as it relates to the covenants and agreements
as to which Covenant Defeasance has occurred), clause (4), clause (5) (except with respect to
Company) and clause (6) of the first paragraph under “—Events of Default” will no longer
constitute Events of Default and (y) Guarantors, if any, of the Notes shall be automatically released
from all of their obligations under their Guarantees of the Notes and the Indenture and such
Guarantees will be automatically released, terminated and discharged.

In order to effect either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders
of the Notes cash in U.S. dollars in such amount as will be sufficient, U.S. Government Obligations
the scheduled payments of principal of and interest on which will be sufficient (without any
reinvestment of such interest), or a combination thereof in such amounts as will be sufficient, as
confirmed, certified or attested by an Independent Financial Advisor in writing to the Trustee, to
pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the stated maturity date
thereof or any earlier Redemption Date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion
of counsel in the United States (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions,
exceptions and limitations) confirming that:

(a) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue
Service a ruling; or

(b) since the date of the Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal
income tax law;

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel shall confirm that,
the Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal
Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
opinion of counsel in the United States (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions, exceptions and limitations) confirming that the Holders of the Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance
and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at
the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit
(other than a Default and Event of Default resulting from borrowing of funds to be applied to
make such deposit and any similar or substantially contemporaneous transactions and, in each case,
the granting of any Liens in connection therewith);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, any agreement or instrument that, in the judgment of the Company, is
material with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (excluding the
Indenture) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is bound;

(6) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an opinion of
counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions, exceptions and
limitations), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture to such Legal
Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with; and


-----

(7) the Company shall have delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of the Notes on the stated maturity date thereof or on the applicable
Redemption Date, as the case may be (which instructions may be contained in the Officer’s
Certificate referred to in clause (6) above).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the opinion of counsel required by clause (2) above with respect
to a Legal Defeasance need not be delivered if all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation (1) have become due and payable or (2) will become due and payable on their
maturity date or any earlier Redemption Date within one year and, in the case of any such
redemption, under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company.

##### Satisfaction and discharge

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving
rights of registration of transfer or exchange of the Notes as expressly provided for in the Indenture
and except for the Trustee’s right to reimbursement of fees and expenses and indemnification as
expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes, and all of the Guarantees, if
any, of the Notes shall be discharged, terminated and released, when:

(1) either

(a) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes
that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been
deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to
the Company or discharged from such trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation;
or

(b) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and
payable by giving of a notice of redemption, upon stated maturity or otherwise, will become
due and payable within one year (upon stated maturity or otherwise), or are to be called
for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company,
and the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee cash
in such amount as will be sufficient, U.S. Government Obligations the scheduled payments of
principal of and interest on which will be sufficient (without any reinvestment of such
interest), or a combination thereof in such amounts as will be sufficient, to pay and discharge
the entire Indebtedness on such Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes to the date of
maturity or redemption, as the case may be, together with irrevocable instructions from the
Company directing the Trustee to apply such funds to the payment thereof at maturity or
redemption;

(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by the Company under the
Indenture; and

(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an opinion of counsel
(which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions, exceptions and limitations)
stating that all conditions precedent under the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge
of the Indenture have been complied with.


-----

##### Modification of the notes, any guarantees or the indenture

From time to time, the Company, the Guarantors (if any) of the Notes and the Trustee, without
the consent of the Holders of the Notes, may modify, amend or supplement the Notes, any
Guarantees or other guarantees of the Notes or the Indenture:

(1) to cure any ambiguity or omission; or to correct or supplement any provision contained in the
Indenture, any Notes or any Guarantees or other guarantees of the Notes which may be defective

Notes or that does not adversely affect in any material respect the rights of any Holder of the
Notes;

(5) to provide for any Subsidiary of the Company or any other Person to provide a Guarantee or
other guarantee of the Notes, to add, novate, confirm or assume a Guarantee or other guarantee
of the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes or any Guarantee or other
guarantee of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any
Guarantor, Guarantee, other guarantor or other guarantee of the Notes or any Lien with respect to
or securing the Notes or any Guarantee or other guarantee thereof, in each case when such
release, termination or discharge is provided for under the Indenture, under any Guarantee or
other guarantee or under any instrument or agreement creating or evidencing any such Lien, as
the case may be;

(6) to conform the provisions of the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantees of the Notes to this
“Description of the Notes” section of this offering memorandum;

(7) to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the qualification of the
Indenture under the TIA;

(8) to comply with the rules of any applicable Depositary;

(9) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment under the Indenture of a successor

conferred upon the Company or any Guarantor or other guarantor of the Notes pursuant to the
Indenture;

(11) to provide for the issuance and delivery of Additional Notes; and

(12) to eliminate the effect of any Accounting Change or the application thereof.

Other modifications, amendments and supplements of the Notes, any Guarantees or other

in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or a tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes), and
compliance with any provision of the Notes, any Guarantees or other guarantees thereof or the
Indenture may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal


-----

amount of the then outstanding Notes (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or a tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes), except that, without the consent
of each Holder of Notes, no amendment, supplement or waiver may:

(1) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or
waiver;

(2) reduce the rate of or change or have the effect of changing the time for payment of interest,
including defaulted interest, on any Notes, except pursuant to clause (6) below;

(3) reduce the principal of or change or have the effect of changing the final stated maturity of

Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as the case may be (including, without limitation, any
Consolidated EBITDA attributable to the Investments, Persons or other securities or assets which
are being purchased, acquired or originated as aforesaid), in each case as if such incurrence,
repayment, purchase, acquisition or origination, as the case may be, had occurred on the first day
of the Four Quarter Period;

in clause (3) of this definition, in each case that occurred during the Four Quarter Period or at any
time subsequent to the last day of the Four Quarter Period and on or prior to the Determination
Date, as if such incurrence or repayment had occurred on the first day of the Four Quarter Period,
but only to the extent the incurrence or repayment of such Indebtedness was made in connection


-----

with a transaction or series of related transactions described in clause (3) below that meets the
significance test set forth in such clause (3); provided, however, that such calculation shall not give
pro forma effect to the incurrence of any Indebtedness described in this clause (2) if such
Indebtedness is not outstanding as of the Determination Date; and

(3) any sale or other disposition or any purchase or other acquisition or origination of any
Investments, Persons or other securities or assets (other than any purchase, acquisition or
origination covered by clause (1) above) made by such Person or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
without limitation, by merger, consolidation, acquisition of Capital Stock or otherwise) in one
transaction or a series of related transactions during the Four Quarter Period or at any time
subsequent to the last day of the Four Quarter Period and on or prior to the Determination Date
(including, without limitation, any Consolidated EBITDA attributable to the Investments, Persons or
other securities or assets which were sold, disposed of, purchased, acquired or originated as
aforesaid), in each case as if such sale, disposition, purchase, acquisition or origination had occurred
on the first day of the Four Quarter Period, but, anything in this clause (3) to the contrary
notwithstanding, only if the Investments, Persons or other securities or assets sold, disposed of,
purchased, acquired or originated in such transaction or such series of related transactions, as the
case may be, met, at the time of such transaction or series of related transactions (or, at the
option of the Company, would have met, as of the last day of the Four Quarter Period), the
conditions specified in clause (1), (2) or (3) of Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the
SEC (as such Rule is in effect on the Issue Date but substituting 20% for 10% each place 10%
appears in such Rule and assuming that the Company was the “registrant” and that the
Investments, Persons or other securities or assets sold, disposed of, purchased, acquired or
originated in such transaction or series of related transactions constituted a “subsidiary” of the
Company within the meaning of such Rule), with the calculation of whether any such conditions
are met to be made in accordance with GAAP.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and if pro forma effect is being given to the
incurrence of such Indebtedness, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be calculated as if
the rate in effect on the Determination Date had been the applicable rate for that portion of
the Four Quarter Period during which such Indebtedness was not outstanding (taking into account
any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness if such Interest Rate Agreement
has a remaining term in excess of 12 months). If any Indebtedness bears an interest rate chosen at
the option of the Company and if pro forma effect is being given to the incurrence of such
Indebtedness, the interest rate shall be calculated by applying such optional rate chosen by the
Company for that portion of the Four Quarter Period during which such Indebtedness was not
outstanding. For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any
calculation under this definition, the pro forma calculations will be determined in good faith by
the Company and such pro forma calculations may include, for the avoidance of doubt and at the
Company’s sole discretion, cost savings and expense reductions relating to any transaction
which is being given pro forma effect (x) that have been or are expected to be realized within
12 months after the date of such transaction and/or (y) that are determined in accordance with
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act.

In making any pro forma calculation, the amount of Indebtedness under any revolving credit
facility outstanding on the applicable Determination Date (other than any Indebtedness being
incurred under such facility in connection with a transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) will be deemed to be:

(i) the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable Four Quarter Period or
such shorter period for which such facility was outstanding, or

(ii) if such facility was created after the end of such Four Quarter Period, the average daily
balance of such Indebtedness during the period from the date of creation of such facility to such
Determination Date.

in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to
Refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such Refinancing would
cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such Refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated
restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount (or, if
incurred with original issue discount, the issue price) of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the principal amount (or if incurred with original issue discount, the accreted value) of
such Indebtedness being Refinanced plus any additional Indebtedness incurred to pay interest or
dividends thereon plus the amount of any premium (including tender premiums), defeasance costs
and any fees and expenses incurred in connection with the incurrence of such Refinancing
Indebtedness; and provided, further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the
“—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness” covenant, the “Maintenance of Total
Unencumbered Assets” covenant, the definition of “Permitted Indebtedness” or elsewhere in the
Indenture, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company and its Subsidiaries may
incur pursuant to such “—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness” covenant and such
definition shall not be deemed to be exceeded, nor shall the Company be deemed to have
breached its obligations under such “—Maintenance of Total Unencumbered Assets” covenant,
solely as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Subject to the foregoing, the principal
amount of any Indebtedness incurred to Refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different
currency from the Indebtedness being Refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness and
Indebtedness being Refinanced are denominated that is in effect on the date of such Refinancing.
Unsecured Indebtedness shall not be treated as subordinated or junior to secured Indebtedness
merely because such Indebtedness is unsecured. For purposes of clarity, it is understood and agreed

not include any commitment to make loans, advances or other Investments, or to purchase
Investments, Persons or other securities or assets.

other provision of the Indenture which expressly provides that a law, rule or regulation, or any
accounting standard, codification or pronouncement, shall be the law, rule, regulation, standard,
codification or pronouncement, as applicable, as in effect on the Issue Date or other specified
date and except as the context otherwise requires.


-----

### Book-entry, delivery and form

Except as set forth below, the Notes will be issued in registered, global form without interest
coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
Notes offered and sold to QIBs (“Rule 144A Notes”) will initially be represented by one or more
Notes in registered, global form without interest coupons (“Rule 144A Global Notes”). Notes offered
and sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S Notes”) will initially
be represented by one or more Notes in registered, global form without interest coupons
(“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, “Global Notes”).
The Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with the Trustee, as custodian for DTC and
registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to the accounts of direct
participants in DTC as described below. Through and including the 40th day after the later of the
commencement of this offering and the closing of this offering (such period through and
including such 40th day, the “Restricted Period”) beneficial interests in Regulation S Global Notes
may be held only through Clearstream and Euroclear (as participants in DTC), and may not be
offered or sold in the United States (within the meaning of Regulation S) or to or for the account
or benefit of a U.S. person (within the meaning of Regulation S), except to a person that takes
delivery through a Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements
described below or otherwise in accordance with Regulation S. Beneficial interests in Rule 144A
Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes at any
time except in the circumstances described below. See “—Exchanges Between Regulation S
Notes and Rule 144A Notes.” Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in
whole and not in part, only to DTC, or another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its
nominee. Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the
Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Certificated Notes (as defined
below). See “—Exchange of Book-Entry Notes for Certificated Notes.” Rule 144A Notes and
Regulation S Notes (including beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes and Regulation S
Global Notes) will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and will bear the applicable
restrictive legend set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of beneficial
interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its
direct or indirect participants (including, if applicable, those of Clearstream and Euroclear),
which may change from time to time.

Initially, the Trustee will act as paying agent and registrar for the Notes. The Notes may be
presented for registration of transfer and exchange at the offices of the registrar.

##### Certain procedures

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream
are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within
the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them from time
to time. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to
contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its
participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and
settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry
changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s
system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that
clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly
(collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own
securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through Participants or Indirect Participants.


-----

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it, ownership of interests in
the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership thereof will be effected only
through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the
Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interest in the Global Notes).

Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes may hold their interests therein directly through DTC, if
they are Participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and
Clearstream) which are Participants or Indirect Participants in such system. Investors in the
Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or
Clearstream, if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations that are
participants in such system. After the expiration of the Restricted Period (but not earlier), investors
may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system
other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Each of Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of its participants through customers’ securities accounts in
its name on the books of its depositary. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through
Euroclear or Clearstream, will be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those
interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream will also be subject to the procedures and
requirements of such system. The laws of some states require, and the laws of other jurisdictions
may require, that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they
own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons
will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act
on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global
Note to pledge such interests to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical
certificate evidencing such interests.

Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have Notes registered
in their names, will not receive physical delivery of Certificated Notes and will not be considered
the registered owners or “holders” thereof under the Indenture for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered
in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC or its nominee in its capacity as the
registered holder under the Indenture. Under the terms of the Indenture, we and the Trustee will
treat the persons in whose names the Notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the
owners thereof for the purpose of receiving such payments and for any and all other purposes
whatsoever. Consequently, neither we, the Trustee nor any of our or the Trustee’s agents has or
will have any responsibility or liability for (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or
Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership
interest in any Global Notes, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or
any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in
any Global Notes or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of
its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt
of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to
credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date, in amounts
proportionate to their respective holdings in the principal amount of the relevant security as
shown on the records of DTC. Payments by Participants and Indirect Participants to the beneficial
owners of Global Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and
will be the responsibility of Participants or Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility
of DTC, the Trustee or us. Neither we nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of
its Participants or Indirect Participants in identifying or remitting payments to the beneficial
owners of the Notes, and we and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in
relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.


-----

Except for trades involving only Euroclear and Clearstream participants, interests in the Global
Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System and
secondary market trading activity in such interests will, therefore, settle in immediately available
funds, subject in all cases to the rules and procedures of DTC and its Participants. See “—Same-Day
Settlement and Payment.” Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer
Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s
procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear
and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules
and operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described under
“Transfer Restrictions,” crossmarket transfers between Participants in DTC, on the one hand, and
Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in
accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream by their respective depositaries;
however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or
Clearstream by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and
within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream will, if the
transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to
take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant
Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for
same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream participants may not
deliver instructions directly to the respective depositaries for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only at
the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the
Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Global
Notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if
an Event of Default (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) with respect to the Notes has
occurred and is continuing, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Certificated
Notes (which will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless
we determine otherwise), and to distribute such Certificated Notes to its Participants.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform the
foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes and in the
Rule 144A Global Notes among their respective participants, and such procedures may be
discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee nor any of our or their respective agents
will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

##### Exchange of book-entry notes for certificated notes

A Global Note will be exchangeable for Notes in registered certificated form without coupons
(“Certificated Notes”) if (1) DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary
for the Global Notes or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act (if
such registration is required by applicable law) and we do not appoint a successor depositary for
the Notes within 90 days after we receive such notification or we become aware that DTC has
ceased to be so registered, as the case may be, (2) we, at our option and subject to DTC
procedures, notify the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of Certificated Notes
or (3) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default. In all cases, Certificated
Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests therein will be registered
in the names, and issued in any authorized denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC (in


-----

accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred
to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless we determine otherwise.

##### Exchanges between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes

Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note
may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Note only if such exchange
occurs in connection with a transfer of beneficial interests in such Regulation S Global Note
pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that the Notes are being transferred to a person who
the transferor reasonably believes to be a QIB, purchasing for its own account or the account of
a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and in accordance with all applicable
securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions. Beneficial interests in a
Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest
in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Restricted Period,
only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of
Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) and, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of such
Restricted Period, that the interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through
Euroclear or Clearstream.

Transfers involving an exchange of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note for a
beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa will be effected in DTC by means of an
instruction originated by the Trustee under the Indenture through the DTC Deposit/ Withdraw
at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments
will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a
corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa, as
applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an
interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly,
will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial
interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and
practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note
prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period.

##### Same-day settlement and payment

Payments in respect of the Notes represented by Global Notes (including principal and interest)
will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to DTC or its nominee, as the registered
holder of the Global Notes. In the event that Certificated Notes are issued under the limited
circumstances described above, we will pay the principal and premium, if any, on, and may pay
interest on, the Certificated Notes at the office or agency maintained by us for such purpose in the
United States of America, which initially shall be an office of the Trustee, upon surrender of such
Certificated Note at such office or agency. Interest on any Certificated Notes may also be paid, at
our option, by check mailed to the addresses of the registered holders entitled thereto or by
wire transfer to accounts in the United States of America specified by such holders. The Notes
represented by Global Notes are expected to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System,
and any permitted secondary market trading activity in the Notes will, therefore, be required by
DTC to be settled in immediately available funds.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant in DTC will be credited, and any such
crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities


-----

settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear or Clearstream) immediately
following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of
sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a
Participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available
in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear
or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.


-----

### Material United States federal income tax considerations

The following summarizes certain material United States federal income tax consequences
expected to result from the purchase at the issue price (the first price at which a substantial amount
of Notes is sold to purchasers other than bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations
acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers), ownership and
disposition of Notes by holders acquiring Notes at original issue for cash pursuant to this offering.

This discussion is based on:

- the Code;

- current, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code;

- the legislative history of the Code;

- current administrative interpretations and practices of the IRS; and

- court decisions;

all as of the date of this offering memorandum. In addition, the administrative interpretations
and practices of the IRS include its practices and policies as expressed in private letter rulings that
are not binding on the IRS, except with respect to the particular taxpayers who requested and
received those rulings. Future legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and
practices and/or court decisions may adversely affect the tax considerations contained in this
discussion. Any change could apply retroactively to transactions preceding the date of the change.
The tax considerations contained in this discussion may be challenged by the IRS, and we have
not requested, and do not plan to request, any rulings from the IRS concerning the Notes.

The tax treatment of a holder of the Notes may vary depending upon a holder’s particular situation.
Certain holders (including, but not limited to, certain financial institutions, insurance companies,
broker-dealers, persons who mark-to-market the Notes, an accrual method taxpayer subject to
special tax accounting rules as a result of its use of financial statements, tax-exempt organizations,
regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, U.S. Holders (as defined below)
whose functional currency for tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar, expatriates and persons holding
Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge” or “conversion transaction”) may be subject to special rules
not discussed below. This discussion is limited to holders who will hold the Notes as “capital
assets” (generally, property held for investment) within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code.

**YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES OF**
**YOUR PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES.**

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is for United
States federal income tax purposes (1) a citizen or resident of the United States, (2) a corporation,
including for this purpose an entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income
tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political
subdivision thereof, (3) an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax
regardless of its source, or (4) a trust, if both (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise
primary supervision over the administration of the trust and (b) one or more United States
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, to the extent provided in Treasury regulations, certain trusts that are beneficial
holders of the Notes and in existence on August 20, 1996, and treated as United States persons
prior to such date, that elect to continue to be treated as United States persons also will be U.S.
Holders. As used herein, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner (other than an
entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) of
Notes that is not a U.S. Holder.


-----

If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for
United States federal income tax purposes) holds Notes, the treatment of a partner in the
partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and activities of the partnership. A
holder that is a partnership and partners in such partnership should consult their tax advisors
regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing
of the Notes.

##### Characterization of the notes held by REITs

Debt instruments of “publicly offered REITs” constitute “real estate assets” within the meaning
of Section 856(c)(5)(B) of the Code. We are, and expect we will continue to be, a “publicly offered
REIT.” Therefore, for so long as we continue to be a “publicly offered REIT,” Notes held by a
REIT will constitute “real estate assets” within the meaning of Section 856(c)(5)(B) of the Code.
However, in order for a REIT to retain its qualification as a REIT, at the close of each quarter of its
taxable year, not more than 25% of the value of the total assets of such REIT may be represented
by debt instruments of “publicly offered REITs” that are not secured by real property.

##### U.S. holders

**_Interest_**

Stated interest on the Notes will be included in the income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at
the time such interest is received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s regular method
of tax accounting.

**_Original issue discount_**

The Notes will be issued at a price that comes within the de minimis exception to the original
issue discount (“OID”) provisions of the Code, and, accordingly, U.S. Holders will not be subject to
the OID provisions with respect to the Notes.

**_Sale, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition_**

In general, a U.S. Holder of the Notes will recognize gain or loss upon the sale, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of such Notes in an amount equal to the difference
between (1) the amount of cash (including any “make-whole” premium in the event of a
redemption requiring its payment) and the fair market value of property received in exchange
therefor (except to the extent attributable to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, as
described below) and (2) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Notes. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis
in the Notes generally will be equal to the price paid for such Notes. The portion of any proceeds
that is attributable to accrued and unpaid interest will not be taken into account in computing
the U.S. Holder’s capital gain or loss, but will instead be treated as interest income to the extent not
previously included in income, as described under “—Interest” above.

Capital gain recognized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder from the sale of a capital asset that has
been held for more than 12 months is currently subject to United States federal income tax at
reduced rates. Capital gain from the sale of an asset held for 12 months or less will be subject to
United States federal income tax at ordinary income tax rates. In addition, capital gain recognized
by a corporate taxpayer will continue to be subject to United States federal income tax at the
ordinary income tax rates applicable to corporations. The ability to deduct capital losses is
subject to limitations under the Code.

**_Additional tax on investment income_**

A U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate or trust that does not fall into a special class of trusts
that is exempt from such tax is subject to a 3.8% tax on the lesser of (1) the U.S. Holder’s “net


-----

investment income” for the relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S. Holder’s modified
adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold. A U.S. Holder’s net
investment income will generally include its interest income on the Notes and net gain from the
disposition of the Notes, unless such interest income and net gain is derived in the ordinary course
of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of certain
passive or trading activities). Net investment income may, however, be reduced by properly
allocable deductions to such income. U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts are urged
to consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability of this 3.8% Medicare tax to their income
and gains from the Notes.

##### Non-U.S. holders

**_Interest_**

A Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal income or withholding
tax on payments of interest on the Notes, unless that Non-U.S. Holder actually or constructively
owns 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock that are entitled
to vote within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3) of the Code, is a controlled foreign corporation
related to us or is a bank receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, and
provided that such interest is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in
the United States by the Non-U.S. Holder. To qualify for the exemption from taxation, the last
United States payor, as defined in the Treasury regulations (or a non-U.S. payor who is a qualified
intermediary or withholding foreign partnership) in the chain of payment prior to payment to a
Non-U.S. Holder (the “Withholding Agent”), must have received, before payment, a statement that
(1) is signed by the beneficial owner of the Notes under penalties of perjury, (2) certifies that
such owner is not a U.S. Holder and (3) provides the name and address of the beneficial owner.
The statement may be made on an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E or a substantially similar
form. An IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E is generally effective for the year of signature
plus the following three calendar years; however, the beneficial owner must inform the
Withholding Agent of any change in the information on the statement within 30 days of such
change. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E may
in certain circumstances remain effective until a change in circumstances makes any information
on such form inaccurate. If the Notes are held through a securities clearing organization or certain
other financial institution, the beneficial owner must provide to such organization or institution
an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E and the organization or institution must provide a
certificate stating that such organization or institution has been provided with a valid IRS Form
W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E to the Withholding Agent.

A Non-U.S. Holder that does not qualify for exemption from withholding as described in the
preceding paragraph generally will be subject to withholding of United States federal income tax
at a tax rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) on payments of interest on the Notes.

**_Sale, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition_**

A Non-U.S. Holder will generally not be subject to United States federal income or withholding
tax on any amount which constitutes gain upon the sale, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of the Notes, provided (1) the gain is not effectively connected with the conduct of a
trade or business in the United States by the Non-U.S. Holder and (2) in the case of an individual
Non-U.S. Holder, such holder is not present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year. Certain other exceptions may be applicable and a Non-U.S. Holder should consult its
tax advisor in this regard.

If a Non-U.S. Holder is an individual that is present in the United States for 183 days or more in a
taxable year and certain other conditions are met, such holder will generally be subject to a flat


-----

30% tax (subject to reductions under an applicable income tax treaty if the Non-U.S. Holder is
eligible for the benefits of such treaty) on the gain derived from the sale, redemption or other
taxable disposition in such taxable year, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses, even
though such holder is not considered a resident of the United States. The portion of any proceeds
that is attributable to accrued and unpaid interest will not be taken into account in computing
the Non-U.S. Holder’s capital gain or loss, but will instead be treated as interest income, as described
under “—Interest” above.

To the extent that gain or interest income with respect to the Notes is not exempt from the
United States federal income or withholding tax, a Non-U.S. Holder may be able to reduce or
eliminate such tax under an applicable income tax treaty.

**_Conduct of a United States trade or business_**

A Non-U.S. Holder whose gain or interest income with respect to the Notes is effectively connected
with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by such Non-U.S. Holder (and if
certain tax treaties apply, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S.
Holder in the United States) will not be subject to the United States federal withholding tax if
such Non U.S. Holder provides an IRS Form W-8ECI to the Withholding Agent. Instead, such
Non-U.S. Holder will generally be subject to tax on such gain and interest income at regular income
tax rates in the manner similar to the taxation of U.S. Holders. In addition, a corporate Non-U.S.
Holder will be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% of its “dividend equivalent amount”
(generally representing the amount that remains after paying the tax on such gain or interest
income discussed in the preceding sentence), although a Non-U.S. Holder may be able to reduce
or eliminate such tax under an applicable income tax treaty.

##### Information reporting and backup withholding

Generally, we must report annually to the IRS and to Non-U.S. Holders the amount of interest
paid to Non-U.S. Holders and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments.
Copies of the information returns reporting such interest and withholding may also be made
available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder resides under the
provisions of an applicable income tax treaty.

Backup withholding of United States federal income tax may apply to payments made in respect
of the Notes to registered owners who are not “exempt recipients” and who fail to provide certain
identifying information (such as the registered owner’s taxpayer identification number) on an
IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder, or an IRS Form W-9, in
the case of a U.S. Holder. Compliance with the identification procedures described in the preceding
section generally would establish an exemption from backup withholding for Non-U.S. Holders.
As discussed above, a Non-U.S. Holder whose gain or interest income with respect to the Notes is
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by such Non-U.S.
Holder will generally not be subject to backup withholding if the Non-U.S. Holder provides the
Withholding Agent with an IRS Form W-8ECI.

In addition, upon the sale of the Notes to (or through) a broker, the broker may be required to
withhold an appropriate percentage of the entire purchase price, unless the seller provides, in the
required manner, certain identifying information and, in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder, certifies
that such seller is a Non-U.S. Holder (and certain other conditions are met). Such a sale may also be
reported by the broker to the IRS (which report must, in certain circumstances, include the
adjusted basis of the Notes), unless the seller certifies its Non-U.S. Holder status (and certain
conditions are met). Certification of the registered owner’s Non-U.S. Holder status would be made
normally on an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E under penalties of perjury, although in
certain cases it may be possible to submit other documentary evidence.


-----

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules from a payment to a beneficial owner would be allowed as a refund or a credit against
such beneficial owner’s United States federal income tax liability provided the required information
is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.

##### Potential application of rules governing contingent payment debt instruments

We may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the stated interest or principal on the Notes,
including as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “—Optional
Redemption.” The potential obligation to pay these additional amounts may implicate the
provisions of applicable Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.”

Although the matter is not free from doubt, we do not intend to treat the Notes as contingent
payment debt instruments. However, there is no assurance that our position would be respected
by the IRS or, if challenged, upheld by a court. If the IRS were to challenge our position, the Notes
may constitute contingent payment debt instruments. If the Notes are treated as contingent
payment debt instruments, a holder that is subject to United States federal income tax may be
required to accrue OID on the Notes in excess of stated interest and otherwise applicable OID, and
to treat as ordinary income (rather than capital gain) any gain that is recognized upon a sale,
redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes. In the event that any of these contingencies
were to occur, it would affect the character, amount and timing of any income recognized. The
discussions above under “—U.S. Holders” and “—Non-U.S. Holders” assume that the Notes will not
be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the possible application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to
the Notes.

##### Foreign account tax compliance act

Sections 1471-1474 of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder (“FATCA”) impose
withholding taxes on certain types of payments made to “foreign financial institutions,” as
specially defined under FATCA, and certain other non-U.S. entities. FATCA imposes a 30%
withholding tax on payments of interest on the Notes paid to a foreign financial institution
unless the foreign financial institution is deemed to be compliant with FATCA or enters into an
agreement with the IRS to, among other things, undertake to identify accounts held by certain U.S.
persons or U.S.-owned foreign entities, annually report certain information about such accounts,
and withhold 30% on payments to account holders whose actions prevent it from complying with
these reporting and other requirements. In addition, FATCA imposes a 30% withholding tax on
the same types of payments to a non-financial foreign entity of a certain type unless the entity
certifies that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or furnishes identifying information to
the IRS or to the withholding agent regarding each substantial U.S. owner. While withholdable
payments would have originally included payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other
disposition of the Notes on or after January 1, 2019, recently proposed Treasury regulations provide
that such payments of gross proceeds (other than amounts treated as interest) do not constitute
withholdable payments. Taxpayers may generally rely on these proposed Treasury regulations until
they are revoked or final Treasury regulations are issued. Prospective investors should consult
their tax advisors regarding the application of FATCA to the acquisition, ownership or disposition
of the Notes.

### State and local tax considerations

In addition to the United States federal income tax consequences described in “Material United
States Federal Income Tax Considerations,” you should consider the state and local income tax
consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes. State and local income tax
law may differ substantially from corresponding federal law, and this discussion does not purport
to describe any aspect of the income tax laws of any state or locality. You should consult your
tax advisor with respect to the various state and local tax consequences of an investment in the
Notes.

### Transfer restrictions

Because of the following restrictions, you are advised to consult legal counsel prior to purchasing
or making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of the Notes offered hereby.

The Notes have not been registered for offer or sale under the Securities Act or the securities laws
of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from,
or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the
securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes are being offered
and sold only to (a) QIBs purchasing for their own account or for the account of other QIBs in
reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by
Rule 144A or (b) non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S.

Prior to the U.S. Resale Restriction Termination Date (as defined in clause (3) below), each
acquirer of a beneficial interest in a Note represented by a Rule 144A Global Note or a Certificated
Note issued in exchange for interests in a Rule 144A Global Note under the limited circumstances
described under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form,” by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to
have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with the Initial Purchasers and us as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes have not been registered for offer or sale

transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any
other applicable securities laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in a transaction not
subject thereto and, in each case, in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in
paragraph (3) and in the Indenture.

(2) It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of ours and it is a QIB and is aware that any
transfer of Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A and that such acquisition will be for
its own account or for the account of another QIB to whom notice has been given that such transfer
is being made pursuant to Rule 144A.

(3) It (1) represents that it and any investor account for which it is acquiring Notes is a QIB to
whom notice has been given that such transfer is being made pursuant to Rule 144A, (2) agrees
to offer, sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of such Notes or any interest or
participation therein, prior to (x) the date which is six months (assuming we satisfy the current
public reporting requirements of Rule 144) or one year (if we do not) after the later of the date
of original issue of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) and the last date on which we or any
“affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of ours was the owner of such Notes (or
any predecessor thereto) or any such interest or participation or (y) such later date, if any, as
may be required by any subsequent change in applicable law (the “U.S. Resale Restriction
Termination Date”) only (a) to us or any of our subsidiaries, (b) pursuant to a registration statement
which is effective under the Securities Act, (c) for so long as such Notes are eligible for resale
pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB acquiring such Notes or such
interest or participation for its own account or for the account of another QIB to whom notice is
given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A, (d) to a non-U.S. person in an offshore transaction within the meaning
of, and in compliance with, Regulation S or (e) pursuant to any other available exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject to, in each of the foregoing cases, any
requirement of law that the disposition of such Notes or such interest or participation be at all
times within its or their control, and to compliance with the securities laws of any other applicable
jurisdiction and with the procedures specified in the Indenture. The foregoing restrictions on


-----

resale will not apply after the U.S. Resale Restriction Termination Date. Furthermore, (i) if any
offer, sale or transfer of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Note is proposed to be made
prior to the U.S. Resale Restriction Termination Date to a person who takes delivery in the form of
an interest in a Regulation S Global Note, the transferor shall deliver the applicable certificate
for such offer, sale or transfer in the form prescribed in the Indenture, as described under “BookEntry, Delivery and Form—Exchanges between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes” and
(ii) if any offer, sale or transfer of a Certificated Note bearing the immediately following legend
or a substantially similar legend is proposed to be made, such transfer shall be subject to the
delivery of such certifications, legal opinions (which will be required in the case of a transfer
pursuant to clause (e) above) or other information, as may be required by the Indenture or by the
Company. It further acknowledges that each Rule 144A Global Note and each Certificated Note
issued in exchange for interests in a Rule 144A Global Note under the limited circumstances
described under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form” will bear the following legend or a legend
substantially to the following effect unless such legend is removed in accordance with the

Each acquirer of a Note, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented to and agreed with the Initial Purchasers and us as follows:

(1) It acknowledges that (a) none of us, the Initial Purchasers or any person acting on behalf of us
or the Initial Purchasers has made any representation, or warranty, express or implied, to it with

including an opportunity to ask questions of and request information from us and (d) the Initial
Purchasers are not making any representation or warranty that the information included or
incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum is accurate or complete and are not
responsible in any way for such information.

(2) It has sophisticated knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and is
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of purchasing the Notes, and it and any investor accounts
for which it is acting are each able to bear the economic risks of its or their investment for an
indefinite period of time.

of its acknowledgments, representations and agreements and agrees that, if any of its
acknowledgments, representations or agreements is no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify
us and the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more

account and it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and
agreements on behalf of each such account.

(4) It agrees that it will deliver to each person to whom it transfers a Note notice of any restrictions

### Plan of distribution

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is acting as representative of each of the Initial Purchasers named
below. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement among us and the
Initial Purchasers, we have agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and each of the Initial Purchasers
has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from us, the principal amount of Notes set
forth opposite its name below.

**Principal amount of**

The Initial Purchasers will purchase all of the Notes sold if any Notes are purchased. If an Initial
Purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the
non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated.
We have agreed to indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the Initial Purchasers may be
required to make in respect of those liabilities. The offering of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers
is subject to receipt and acceptance, and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right to reject, any
order in whole or in part.

##### Commissions and discounts

The representative has advised us that the Initial Purchasers propose initially to offer the Notes at
the offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial
offering of the Notes, the offering price or any other term of the offering of the Notes may be
changed. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates.

##### Notes are not being registered

The Notes have not been registered for offer or sale under the Securities Act or the securities laws
of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes are subject to restrictions on resale and transfer
as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes for
resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. The Initial Purchasers will
not offer or sell any Notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be QIBs or pursuant to
offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur in offshore transactions within the meaning of
Regulation S. In addition, until the expiration of the 40-day distribution compliance period, an offer
or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this offering)
may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the
offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the
Securities Act. Each purchaser of Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments,
representations and agreements as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”


-----

##### New issue of notes

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to
apply for listing of the Notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes on
any automated dealer quotation system. We have been advised by certain of the Initial
Purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes after completion of the
offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue market-making
activities at any time without notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the
Notes. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity
of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from
their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities,
our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other
factors.

##### No sales of similar securities

We have agreed that, for a period of 30 days from the date of this offering memorandum, we
will not, without first obtaining the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, offer, sell,
contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company
and having a tenor of more than one year, except for the Notes sold to the Initial Purchasers
pursuant to the purchase agreement.

##### Short positions

In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers may engage in overallotment,
stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in
excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing
transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging,
fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of
the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short
positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may have the effect of
preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes or cause the price of the Notes
to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Initial
Purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at
any time.

Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the
direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price
of the Notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation
that the representatives will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once
commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

##### Alternative settlement dates

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about
, 2020, which is the tenth business day following the date hereof (such settlement
cycle being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such
trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the
date of pricing or the next seven succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact
that the Notes initially will settle in T+10, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of
any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the
Notes on such date should consult their own advisors.


-----

##### Other relationships

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged
in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking,
advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market
making, brokerage, lending and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Certain of
the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide,
a variety of these services to us and to persons and entities with relationships with us, for which
they received or will receive customary fees and expenses, including in connection with this offering.

Pending full allocation of an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering to Eligible
Green and/or Social Projects, we intend to use the net proceeds for the Initial Use of Proceeds,
which consists of funding the redemption of the remaining $250 million outstanding principal
amount of our February 2021 Senior Notes (assuming the completion of the partial redemption of
$250 million outstanding principal amount of our February 2021 Senior Notes on November 2,
2020), and general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of outstanding
indebtedness. To the extent that any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates own any of our
February 2021 Senior Notes, upon the Initial Use of Proceeds, such Initial Purchasers or affiliates
will receive a portion of those net proceeds. See “Use of Proceeds.”

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective
affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of
investments, including serving as counterparties to certain derivative and hedging arrangements,
and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps
and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers,
and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or
instruments of ours (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or persons
and entities with relationships with us. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may
also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments
and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short
positions in such assets, securities and instruments.

If any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of
those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those Initial
Purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary
risk management policies. Typically, these Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge
such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default
swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered
hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices
of the Notes offered hereby.
