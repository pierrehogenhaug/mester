This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation or

investor under the UK Prospectus Regulation (together, “Qualified Investors”). Accordingly, any
person making or intending to make an offer in the EEA or the United Kingdom of Notes which are
the subject of the offering contemplated in this offering memorandum may only do so with
respect to Qualified Investors. Neither the Starwood Property Trust, Inc. nor the Initial Purchasers
have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of Notes other than to Qualified
Investors. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended)
and the expression “UK Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”).

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS—The Notes are not intended to be offered,**
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available
to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as
amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a


-----

professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a Qualified
Investor. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014
(as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPs Regulation.

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO UNITED KINGDOM RETAIL INVESTORS—The Notes are not intended to**
be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor

customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as
amended, the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the
Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a Qualified Investor. Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering

### Summary

should consider prior to investing in the Notes. For a more complete understanding of our
company, we encourage you to read this entire document, including the information incorporated

##### Overview

We are a Maryland corporation that commenced operations in August 2009, upon the completion
of our initial public offering. We are focused primarily on originating, acquiring, financing and
managing mortgage loans and other real estate investments in both the United States and Europe.
As market conditions change over time, we may adjust our strategy to take advantage of changes
in interest rates and credit spreads as well as economic and credit conditions.

We have four reportable business segments as of March 31, 2021 and we refer to the investments
within these segments as our target assets:

- Real estate commercial and residential lending—engages primarily in originating, acquiring,
financing and managing commercial first mortgages, non-agency residential mortgages,
subordinated mortgages, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, commercial mortgage-backed
securities (“CMBS”), residential mortgage-backed securities and other real estate and real estaterelated debt investments in both the U.S. and Europe (including distressed or non-performing
loans). Our residential loans are secured by a first mortgage lien on residential property and
consist of non-agency residential loans that are not guaranteed by any U.S. Government agency
or federally chartered corporation.

- Infrastructure lending—engages primarily in originating, acquiring, financing and managing
infrastructure debt investments.

- Real estate property—engages primarily in acquiring and managing equity interests in stabilized
commercial real estate properties, including multifamily properties and commercial properties
subject to net leases, that are held for investment.

- Real estate investing and servicing—includes (i) a servicing business in the U.S. that manages
and works out problem assets, (ii) an investment business that selectively acquires and manages
unrated, investment grade and non-investment grade rated CMBS, including subordinated
interests of securitization and resecuritization transactions, (iii) a mortgage loan business which
originates conduit loans for the primary purpose of selling these loans into securitization
transactions and (iv) an investment business that selectively acquires commercial real estate
assets, including properties acquired from CMBS trusts.

Our segments exclude the consolidation of securitization VIEs.

We seek to attain attractive risk-adjusted returns for our investors over the long term by sourcing
and managing a diversified portfolio of target assets, financed in a manner that is designed to
deliver attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles.

We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust (a
“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). We also operate our
business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our various
wholly-owned subsidiaries. We are externally managed and advised by SPT Management, LLC (our


-----

“manager”) pursuant to the terms of a management agreement. Our manager is controlled by
Barry Sternlicht, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our manager is an affiliate of Starwood
Capital Group Global, L.P. (“Starwood Capital Group”), a privately-held private equity firm
founded by Mr. Sternlicht.

Our corporate headquarters office is located at 591 West Putnam Avenue, Greenwich, Connecticut
06830, and our telephone number is (203) 422-7700.

that, among other things:

                      - limit the ability of us and our subsidiaries to
incur additional indebtedness;

                      - require that we maintain Total Unencumbered
Assets of not less than 120% of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Unsecured
Indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries, in
each case determined on a consolidated basis;
and

                      - impose certain requirements in order for us to
merge or consolidate with or transfer all or
substantially all of our assets to another person.

These covenants are subject to a number of
important exceptions and limitations, and we and
our subsidiaries will have the ability to incur
substantial amounts of additional secured and
unsecured indebtedness notwithstanding these
covenants. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
Covenants.”

**Covenant termination . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The covenants in the Indenture limiting our and
our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional
indebtedness, as well as the covenant described
above under “—Possible Future Guarantees” (other
than the portions of such covenant limiting the
obligations of each Guarantor, if any, under its
Guarantee of the Notes to prevent such obligations
from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer under applicable law and the
portions of such covenant relating to the release of
any Guarantor from its Guarantee of the Notes),
certain portions of the covenant limiting our ability
to merge or consolidate with or transfer all or
substantially all of our assets to another person
and, if any of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the
Notes, all of such Guarantees and all of the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Indenture,
will automatically and permanently terminate
and will be of no further force or effect, and we
will be automatically and permanently released


-----

from our obligations under such covenants (and
the Guarantors, if any, will be automatically and
permanently released from their Guarantees of the
Notes and all of their obligations under the
Indenture) on and after any date that (a) if on
that date the rating agencies that shall have most
recently been selected by us for this purpose are two,
the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from
each of those selected rating agencies or (ii) if on
that date the rating agencies that shall have most
recently been selected by us for this purpose are
three, the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings
from at least two of those selected rating agencies
and (b) no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing. See “Description of the
Notes—Certain Covenants— Covenant
Termination.”

Fitch Ratings Inc. (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors
Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and S&P Global Ratings
(“S&P”) will be the rating agencies we will initially
be permitted to select from as the rating agencies
for this purpose, and we may in our sole discretion
select any two or all three of these rating agencies
from time to time. Furthermore, if at any time
only two of Fitch, Moody’s and S&P (or their
respective successors) are rating the Notes, we may,
at our option and in our sole discretion, select as
a third rating agency for this purpose a rating
agency (other than Fitch, Moody’s and S&P (or their
respective successors)) that is then rating the
Notes, so long as such rating agency is eligible to
be selected for this purpose in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture.

**No registration rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We are not required and do not intend to register
the Notes for resale under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and we
are not required and do not intend to offer to
exchange the Notes for notes registered under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction.

**Transfer restrictions** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We have not registered the Notes under the
Securities Act or any state or other securities laws.
The Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer and
may only be offered or sold in transactions exempt
from or not subject to the registration requirements
of the Securities Act and other applicable
securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**No prior market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is
currently no market. Although certain of the Initial


-----

Purchasers have informed us that they intend to
make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated
to do so, and they may discontinue market making
activities at any time without notice. Accordingly,
we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the
Notes will develop or be maintained.

**No listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will not be listed on any securities
exchange or included in any quotation system.

**Book-entry form . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be issued in book-entry form and
will be represented by one or more global
certificates deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC
and registered in its name or in the name of its
nominee. Beneficial interests in the global Notes
will be shown on, and transfers will be effected only
through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee
and such interests may not be exchanged for
certificated Notes, except in limited circumstances.

**Use of proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We estimate that the net proceeds from this
offering will be approximately $ million,
after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts and
commissions and other estimated offering
expenses payable by us. We intend to allocate an
amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering
to finance or refinance, in whole or in part,
recently completed or future Eligible Green and/or
Social Projects (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”).
Net proceeds allocated to previously incurred costs
associated with Eligible Green and/or Social
Projects will be available for the repayment of
indebtedness previously incurred. Pending full
allocation of an amount equal to the net proceeds
to Eligible Green and/or Social Projects, we intend
to use the entire net proceeds to fund, in part, the
redemption of our 5.00% Senior Notes due
December 2021 (our “December 2021 Senior
Notes”) (such initial use of proceeds, the “Initial
Use of Proceeds”), which may be redeemed without
the payment of a premium on or after
September 15, 2021. Prior to such use, we may use
the net proceeds from this offering for general
corporate purposes, including the repayment of
outstanding indebtedness under our repurchase
facilities. To the extent we use the net proceeds from
this offering to repay outstanding indebtedness
under our repurchase facilities prior to the use
described above, we would expect to re-borrow
the amount repaid under such repurchase facilities
later in 2021 to fund a portion of the redemption
of our December 2021 Senior Notes. Our December


-----

2021 Senior Notes may be redeemed without the
payment of a premium on or after September 15,
2021, and we currently intend to redeem our
December 2021 Senior Notes on or after such date.
This offering memorandum does not constitute a
notice of redemption of our December 2021 Senior
Notes. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Risk factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** An investment in the Notes involves risks, and
prospective investors should carefully consider the
matters discussed under “Risk Factors” beginning on
page 10 of this offering memorandum and in the
reports we file with the SEC pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”), incorporated by reference into this
offering memorandum, before making a decision
to invest in the Notes.


-----

### Risk factors

_Investing in the Notes involves risks. You should carefully read and consider the risks described_
_below as well as the risks described in the sections entitled “Item 1. Business” and “Item 1A. Risk_
_Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is_
_incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. You should also carefully read and_
_consider the sections entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,_
_2020 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and other_
_information contained in and incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum, as well_
_as risks described above in “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” before_
_making a decision to invest in the Notes. Each of these risks could materially and adversely affect_
_our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and prospects and could result in a_
_partial or complete loss of your investment. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely_
_affects our business, operations, financial condition and operating results, it may also have the_
_effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section and those_
_described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is_
_incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. Certain capitalized terms used in this_
“Risk Factors”section and not defined previously in this offering memorandum are defined
_under the caption “Description of the Notes.”_

##### Risks related to the notes and to this offering

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results_**
**_of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes._**

We currently have and, after this offering, will continue to have a significant amount of
indebtedness. As of March 31, 2021, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately
$12.6 billion (excluding accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities, securitization VIE
liabilities and unfunded commitments). As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to (1) the issuance and sale of the Notes in this offering and (2) the Initial Use of Proceeds,
we would have had approximately $12.6 billion of total consolidated indebtedness (excluding
accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities, securitization VIE liabilities and unfunded
commitments). For additional information, see “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.” This
substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate enough
cash to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you and significant effects
on our business. For example, it could:

- make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

- increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

- require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on
our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital,
capital expenditures, our strategic growth initiatives and development efforts and other general
corporate purposes;

- limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in
which we operate;

- restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;

- place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness;
and


-----

- limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate
purposes.

Moreover, the financial covenants in the Indenture are subject to numerous exceptions and
permit us to incur indebtedness under numerous baskets and exceptions and also permit us and
our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness subject to compliance with certain financial ratios, and we
and our subsidiaries will likely be able to incur substantial additional secured and unsecured
indebtedness without violating such covenants. In addition, the Indenture will not impose any
limitation on the incurrence or issuance by us or our subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness and the financial covenants in the Indenture will not apply to VIEs because, under
the Indenture, they will not be considered to be our Subsidiaries, and the Indenture will allow us to
deconsolidate VIEs for purposes of, among other things, determining compliance with the
financial covenants and the amount of our Indebtedness.

In addition, the agreements that govern our current indebtedness contain, and the agreements
that may govern any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other
restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term
best interests. Furthermore, the Indenture will not restrict us or our subsidiaries from paying
dividends or making other distributions on our securities, repurchasing capital stock or indebtedness
or making investments, which could adversely impact our ability to make payments on the
Notes. For information regarding the amount of secured and unsecured indebtedness of us and
certain of our subsidiaries, see “—The Notes and any Guarantees will be unsecured and effectively
subordinated in right of payment to our existing and future secured indebtedness and secured
guarantees to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and guarantees” and
“—The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to the indebtedness, guarantees
and other liabilities (including trade payables) and preferred equity of our subsidiaries that do
not guarantee the Notes and any of our subsidiaries that guarantees the Notes will also be required
to guarantee certain debt in addition to the Notes” below.

**_Despite our current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more_**
**_indebtedness, including secured debt. This could exacerbate the risks associated with our_**
**_substantial leverage._**

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including debt under
the Existing Credit Agreements, the Existing Repurchase Agreements and any future credit and
repurchase agreements that we or our subsidiaries may enter into. In particular, as of March 31,
2021, approximately $7.3 billion (of which $384.1 million has been approved but remains undrawn),
was available in the aggregate to be borrowed under the Existing Credit Agreements and the
Existing Repurchase Agreements, subject to certain conditions. We and our subsidiaries may also
be able to incur additional secured debt, which would be effectively senior in right of payment to
the Notes and, in the case of any subsidiaries that guarantee the Notes, their Guarantees of the
Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness or Guarantee. Our
organizational documents contain no limitations regarding the maximum level of indebtedness
that we may incur. The Indenture will restrict us and our subsidiaries from incurring additional
debt, but these restrictions are subject to numerous baskets and exceptions and also permit us and
our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness subject to compliance with certain financial ratios and
under other exceptions to these restrictions, and we and our subsidiaries will retain the ability to
incur substantial amounts of secured and unsecured indebtedness without violating these
restrictions. In addition, the Indenture will not prevent us or our subsidiaries from incurring
liabilities that do not constitute Indebtedness and the financial covenants in the Indenture will
not apply to VIEs because, under the Indenture, they will not be considered to be our Subsidiaries
and the Indenture will allow us to deconsolidate VIEs for purposes of, among other things,


-----

determining compliance with the financial covenants and the amount of our Indebtedness. See
“Description of the Notes.” If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the
related risks that we now face could intensify.

**_If we default in our obligations under the instruments governing our other indebtedness, we_**
**_may not be able to make payments on the Notes._**

A failure by us to comply with our contractual obligations (including restrictive, financial and
other covenants), to pay our indebtedness and fixed costs or to post collateral (including under
hedging arrangements) could result in a variety of material adverse consequences, including a
default under our indebtedness (including the Notes) and the exercise of remedies by our creditors,
lessors and other contracting parties, and such defaults could trigger additional defaults under
other indebtedness or agreements.

In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could, in general, elect to declare
all of such indebtedness to be immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, and, in the case of secured indebtedness, seize and sell the collateral securing that
indebtedness. If our operating performance declines, we may need to seek waivers from the
holders of our indebtedness to avoid being in default under the instruments governing such
indebtedness. If we breach our covenants under our indebtedness, we may not be able to obtain
a waiver from the holders of such indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all. If this occurs,
we would be in default under such indebtedness, and the holders of such indebtedness and lenders
could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or
liquidation. A default under the agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness and
the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could make us unable to pay principal of,
or premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, which may result in the loss of some or all of your
investment.

**_Our ability to repay our debt, including the Notes, depends on the performance of our subsidiaries_**
**_and their ability to make distributions to us._**

As a holding company, substantially all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries,
which are separate and distinct legal entities and, except in the case of our subsidiaries, if any,
that may guarantee the Notes in the future under the circumstances described under “Description
of the Notes—Possible Future Guarantees,” have no contractual or other obligations to make
payments due on the Notes or to provide funds to us for that purpose. Therefore, our ability to
service our indebtedness, including the Notes, and to meet our other cash needs is dependent on
the earnings of, and the distribution of funds (whether by dividend, distribution, loan or
otherwise) to us by, our subsidiaries. The availability of funds from our subsidiaries will depend
upon, among other things, their operating results, financial condition and legal or contractual
restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and distributions or make loans to us. We cannot assure
you that our subsidiaries will have sufficient funds, or that the agreements governing the existing
and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will not restrict or prevent our subsidiaries from
providing us with sufficient funds, to make payments on the Notes when due and to meet our
other cash needs, and the Indenture will not restrict our subsidiaries from entering into such
restrictive agreements. In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions or loans to us by our
subsidiaries that may be organized or doing business outside of the United States could be subject
to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law and monetary
transfer restrictions in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate and, even if we are able to
repatriate funds from foreign subsidiaries, the repatriation of those funds may be subject to
significant taxes. Furthermore, we guarantee many of the obligations of our subsidiaries and such
guarantees may require us to provide substantial funds or assets to our subsidiaries or their
creditors at a time when we need liquidity to fund our own obligations, such as the Notes.


-----

In addition, any right that we have to receive any assets of or distributions from any subsidiary
upon its bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or winding-up, or to
realize proceeds from the sale of the assets of any subsidiary, would be junior to the claims of that
subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors, and to holders of any preferred equity issued by
that subsidiary or any indebtedness or other liabilities guaranteed by that subsidiary.

**_The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to the indebtedness, guarantees_**
**_and other liabilities (including trade payables) and preferred equity of our subsidiaries that do not_**
**_guarantee the Notes and any of our subsidiaries that guarantees the Notes will also be required_**
**_to guarantee certain debt in addition to the Notes._**

When the Notes are first issued they will not be guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and none
of our subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the Notes in the future, except under the
circumstances set forth in the covenant described in “Description of the Notes—Possible Future
Guarantees.” Moreover, certain classes of our subsidiaries (namely Excluded Subsidiaries,
Securitization Entities and Foreign Subsidiaries) are excluded from any requirement to guarantee
the Notes and any subsidiary that does guarantee the Notes may be released from its guarantee
of the Notes under the circumstances described under “Description of the Notes—Possible Future
Guarantees” or its guarantee of the Notes may automatically and permanently terminate under
the circumstances described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Covenant
Termination.” See, also, the definitions of Excluded Subsidiary, Securitization Entity and Foreign
Subsidiary under the caption “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions.”

Our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts
due on the Notes or to make any funds available to us to pay these amounts, whether by dividend,
distribution, loan or otherwise. Accordingly, the Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of
payment to all existing and future indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities (including
trade payables) and preferred equity of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. As a result, in the event
of bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or winding-up of any such NonGuarantor Subsidiary, all of its creditors (including trade creditors) and all holders of its preferred
equity and any indebtedness or other liabilities guaranteed by such Non-Guarantor Subsidiary
would be entitled to payment in full out of its assets before we would be entitled to any payment.

If any of our subsidiaries guarantees the Notes, the terms of the Existing Convertible Senior
Notes require that such subsidiary also guarantee the Existing Convertible Senior Notes, and we
may in the future enter into other debt instruments with similar requirements. In addition, the
Existing Senior Notes include a covenant substantially similar to the covenant described under
“Description of the Notes—Possible Future Guarantees,” which could require any of our Domestic
Subsidiaries (other than Excluded Subsidiaries and Securitization Entities) that guarantees the Notes
offered hereby to also guarantee the Existing Senior Notes. As of March 31, 2021, $250 million
in aggregate principal amount of Existing Convertible Senior Notes was outstanding and $1.5 billion
aggregate principal amount of our Existing Senior Notes were outstanding.

Certain of our subsidiaries are borrowers or guarantors under the Existing Credit Agreements and
the Existing Repurchase Agreements. As of March 31, 2021, our subsidiaries had approximately
$10.8 billion of indebtedness (excluding accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities,
securitization VIE liabilities and unfunded commitments). As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to (1) the issuance and sale of the Notes in this offering and (2) the
Initial Use of Proceeds, our subsidiaries would have had approximately $10.8 billion of indebtedness
(excluding accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities, securitization VIE liabilities and
unfunded commitments). For additional information, see “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”


-----

**_The Notes and any Guarantees will be unsecured and effectively subordinated in right of_**
**_payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness and secured guarantees of us and any_**
**_Guarantors, respectively, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured_**
**_indebtedness and secured guarantees._**

The Notes and any Guarantees of the Notes by our subsidiaries will be unsecured and therefore
will not have the benefit of any collateral. Accordingly, the Notes and any Guarantees of the Notes
will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness
and secured guarantees of us and any Guarantors, respectively, to the extent of the value of
the assets securing such secured indebtedness and secured guarantees. In that regard, we are a
borrower under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (as defined herein) and a guarantor under the
Revolving Facility Credit Agreement (as defined herein), and we have pledged certain of our equity
interests to secure our indebtedness under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and our guarantee
under the Revolving Facility Credit Agreement. Therefore, the Notes will be effectively subordinated
in right of payment to such indebtedness and guarantee to the extent of the value of the equity
interests securing such indebtedness and guarantee.

The assets securing our or any Guarantor’s indebtedness or guarantees would first be used to
repay in full all indebtedness, guarantees and other obligations secured by them, resulting in all
or a portion of our assets or the assets of any Guarantor being unavailable to satisfy the claims of
the holders of the Notes and other unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any
distribution or payment of our assets or the assets of any Guarantor in any insolvency, dissolution,
winding-up, liquidation, reorganization or other bankruptcy proceeding, holders of the Notes
will participate in our remaining assets or the remaining assets of such Guarantor, as applicable,
ratably with all holders of unsecured indebtedness, unsecured guarantees or other unsecured
obligations (including trade payables) of us or such Guarantor, as applicable. In any of the
foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets, or any assets, to pay
amounts due on the Notes. As a result, holders of the Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders
of our or our subsidiaries’ secured indebtedness or secured guarantees or may receive no
payments whatsoever.

As of March 31, 2021, we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $12.6 billion
(excluding accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities, securitization VIE liabilities and
unfunded commitments), of which approximately $10.9 billion was secured indebtedness (including
approximately $10.8 billion of secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries), and, on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to (1) the issuance and sale of the Notes in this offering and (2) the Initial
Use of Proceeds, as if those transactions had occurred as of March 31, 2021, we would have had
approximately $12.6 billion of total consolidated indebtedness (excluding accounts payable, accrued
expenses, other liabilities, securitization VIE liabilities and unfunded commitments), of which
approximately $10.9 billion would have been secured indebtedness (including approximately
$10.8 billion of secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries). For additional information, see “Use of
Proceeds” and “Capitalization.” In addition, the Indenture will permit us to incur additional
secured indebtedness subject to, among other things, our maintenance of a ratio of Total
Unencumbered Assets to the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Unsecured
Indebtedness of at least 1.2x and our compliance with the covenant described under the caption
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional
Indebtedness.” As of March 31, 2021, we had a ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt
of 1.6x, and, as of the same date, on the pro forma basis described above in this paragraph, we
would have had a ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt of 1.6x.

**_Our ability to repurchase Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited._**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, we will be required (unless we
have exercised our right to redeem all of the Notes by sending a notice of redemption) to offer


-----

to repurchase all of the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable Change of Control Payment Date.
See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” We may be unable to repurchase the Notes
upon a Change of Control Triggering Event because we may not have sufficient funds available or
we may be prohibited from doing so by the terms of our other indebtedness. In that regard, the
Existing Senior Notes include a covenant substantially similar to the covenant applicable to the
Notes as described under the caption “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” In addition,
a transaction constituting a Change of Control Triggering Event, Change of Control or similar event
and certain other events or transactions relating to, for example, the composition of our board
of directors, our adoption of a plan for liquidation or dissolution, a change of control in our
manager or our manager ceasing to be our manager, constitute or may constitute events of default
or require or may require us to repay or offer to repurchase or repay outstanding indebtedness
under other existing or future credit agreements, repurchase agreements, indentures or other
instruments or agreements relating to Indebtedness to which we or any of our subsidiaries is or
becomes a party. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial
resources available to repurchase or repay Notes or other indebtedness should we be required to
do so upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, Change of Control or
other event or transaction. Any failure to repurchase or repay any existing or future indebtedness,
should it become due and payable as the result of a Change of Control Triggering Event, Change
of Control or other event, would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition and could result in the acceleration of other indebtedness
of us and our subsidiaries pursuant to cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions. In addition,
certain existing or future indebtedness of ours and our subsidiaries requires or may require us
or our subsidiaries to repay or offer to repurchase such indebtedness upon the occurrence of certain
changes of control or similar events which may not constitute a Change of Control or Change of
Control Triggering Event with respect to the Notes.

Moreover, we will be required to offer to repurchase Notes only if both a Change of Control and
certain declines in the credit ratings on the Notes occur. By contrast, any requirement that we
repurchase or repay or offer to repurchase or repay, as applicable, indebtedness outstanding under
the Existing Repurchase Agreements, the Existing Convertible Senior Notes or the Existing Credit
Agreements upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (or similar event) or certain other events
relating to, for example, certain changes in the composition of our board of directors, our
adoption of a plan of liquidation or dissolution, a change of control in our manager or our manager
ceasing to be our manager, will arise, in each case, without any requirement that there also be a
decline in our credit rating, and other existing and future instruments and agreements relating to
indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries may have similar provisions. As a result, we may be
required to repay or repurchase or offer to repay or repurchase indebtedness outstanding under
the Existing Repurchase Agreements, the Existing Convertible Senior Notes, the Existing Credit
Agreements and other existing and future instruments and agreements relating to indebtedness
before we are required, or without our being required, to repurchase or offer to repurchase the
Notes.

**_The Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Notes may not provide protection in_**
**_the event of certain transactions or in certain other circumstances._**

The provisions of the Notes which may require us to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon
the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described under “Description of the
Notes—Change of Control” may not provide Holders of Notes protection in the event of highly
leveraged transactions, reorganizations, restructurings, takeovers, acquisitions, mergers,
recapitalizations or similar transactions involving us that might adversely affect holders of Notes.
In particular, any such transaction may not give rise to a Change of Control Triggering Event, in
which case we would not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. Except as described


-----

under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” neither the Indenture nor the Notes will
contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that we repurchase or redeem
the Notes in the event of highly leveraged transactions, reorganizations, restructurings, takeovers,
acquisitions, mergers, recapitalizations or similar transactions involving us.

In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of “all or substantially
all” of the assets (subject to certain exceptions) of us and our subsidiaries taken as a whole to any
person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of such assets of us and our subsidiaries. As a result,
it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event has
occurred and whether we are required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described
above, in which case, the ability of a holder of the Notes to obtain the benefit of the offer for
repurchase of all or a portion of the Notes held by such holder may be adversely impacted.

More generally, courts interpreting change of control provisions under New York law (which is
the governing law of the Notes and the Indenture) have not provided a clear and consistent
meaning of such change of control provisions, and no assurance can be given as to how or if a court
would enforce the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions applicable to the Notes or
how those provisions would be impacted were we to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case.

**_If the Notes are rated investment grade by each of two rating agencies or by at least two of three_**
**_rating agencies, as the case may be, depending on the number of rating agencies selected by_**
**_us, certain covenants contained in the Indenture and any Guarantees of the Notes will be_**
**_automatically and permanently terminated and released, and you will permanently lose the_**
**_protection of these covenants and any such Guarantees._**

The Indenture will contain a covenant that, subject to exceptions, will limit the incurrence of
additional Indebtedness by us and our subsidiaries. If at any time the Notes receive Investment
Grade Ratings from each rating agency selected by us for this purpose (if at such time we have most
recently selected only two such rating agencies) or from at least two of the rating agencies
selected by us (if at such time we have most recently selected three such rating agencies), as the
case may be, at our option, and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
(i) the foregoing covenant limiting the incurrence of Indebtedness, as well as a portion of the
covenant limiting our ability to merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our
assets, (ii) the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Possible Future Guarantees”
that may require, under certain circumstances, one or more of our Domestic Subsidiaries (subject to
exceptions) to guarantee the Notes (other than the portions of such covenant limiting the
obligations of each Guarantor, if any, under its Guarantee of the Notes to prevent such obligations
from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law and the
portions of such covenant relating to the release of any Guarantor from its Guarantee of the
Notes), and (iii) the Guarantees, if any, of the Notes and all of the obligations of the Guarantors, if
any, under the Indenture, will be automatically and permanently terminated and released and
will be of no further force or effect. After such termination, we may incur other indebtedness and
take other actions that would have been prohibited if these covenants had been in effect.
Accordingly, if these covenants are terminated, holders of the Notes will have less covenant
protection than at the time the Notes were issued and will also lose the benefit of any Guarantees
of the Notes. Fitch, Moody’s and S&P will be the rating agencies we will initially be permitted to
select from as the rating agencies for this purpose, and we may in our sole discretion select any two
or all three of these rating agencies from time to time. Furthermore, if at any time only two of
Fitch, Moody’s and S&P (or their respective successors) are rating the Notes, we may, at our option
and in our sole discretion, select as a third rating agency for this purpose a rating agency (other


-----

than Fitch, Moody’s and S&P (or their respective successors)) that is then rating the Notes, so long
as such rating agency is eligible to be selected for this purpose in accordance with the provisions
of the Indenture. There can be no assurance if and when the Notes will ever receive any Investment
Grade Ratings.

**_The credit ratings assigned to the Notes may not reflect all risks of an investment in the Notes._**

The credit ratings assigned to the Notes reflect the rating agencies’ assessments of our ability to
make payments on the Notes when due. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in these credit
ratings will generally affect the market values of the Notes. These credit ratings, however, may
not reflect the potential impact of risks related to the structure, market or other factors related to
the values of the Notes.

**_Changes in our credit rating could adversely affect the market prices or liquidity of the Notes._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including
us. The credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit
ratings for us based on their overall view of the industry in which we operate. Any credit rating
agencies may lower their initial ratings on the Notes or place the Notes on watch list for a possible
downgrade. A negative change in our ratings could have an adverse effect on the market prices
or liquidity of the Notes.

**_Federal and state laws may permit courts, under specific circumstances, to void the Notes and/or_**
**_any Guarantees as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, subordinate claims in respect of the_**
**_Notes and/or any Guarantees and require you to return payments received. If that occurs, you_**
**_may not receive any payments on the Notes or any Guarantees._**

Federal and state creditor-protection related laws, including fraudulent transfer and fraudulent
conveyance statutes, may apply to the Notes and any Guarantees. Under federal bankruptcy law
and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws, which
may vary from state to state, the Notes or any Guarantees thereof could be voided as fraudulent
transfers or conveyances if we or any Guarantors, as applicable, (i) issued the Notes or incurred any
Guarantees with the actual intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors
or (ii) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either
issuing the Notes or incurring any Guarantees and, in the case of (ii) only, one of the following is
also true at the time thereof:

- we or any such Guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the
issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of any such Guarantees;

- the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of any such Guarantees left us or any such Guarantors,
as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on business; or

- we or any such Guarantors intended to, or believed that we or such Guarantor would, incur
debts beyond our or any Guarantor’s ability to pay as they mature.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer
or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court
could find that we or any Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration for the Notes or any Guarantees, as applicable, to the extent that we or any
Guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance
of the Notes or the applicable Guarantees.

The bankruptcy code defines “insolvent” as to an entity other than a partnership or a municipality
as the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, being greater than the


-----

fair value of all of its assets. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to
determine whether or not we or any Guarantors were insolvent at the relevant time.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of a Guarantee of the
Notes was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under
the Notes or that Guarantee (the effect being that holders of the Notes would cease to have a
claim under the Notes or such Guarantee) or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any
amounts received with respect to the Notes or that Guarantee. In the event of a finding that a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes.
Further, the voiding of the Notes or any Guarantees could result in an event of default with respect
to the Notes or our and our subsidiaries’ other debt that could result in acceleration of the
Notes or that debt.

Although the Indenture will contain a provision intended to limit any Guarantor’s liability under
its Guarantee of the Notes to the maximum amount as will not result in the obligations of such
Guarantor under its Guarantee of the Notes constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent
transfer under applicable federal, foreign or state law, this provision may not be effective to protect
any Guarantees of the Notes from being voided under fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent
transfer or similar laws, or prevent that Guarantor’s obligation from being reduced to an amount
that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. For example, in 2009, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
for the Southern District of Florida in Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of TOUSA, Inc. v.
_Citicorp N. Am., Inc. voided certain secured guarantees issued by certain subsidiary guarantors_
notwithstanding the existence of a similar provision which the court found to be ineffective in that
case; this decision was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals on May 15, 2012. If any
Guarantees of the Notes by any Guarantors were held to be unenforceable, the Notes would be
effectively subordinated to all indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities, including trade
payables, and preferred equity of such Guarantor.

Finally, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees
of the Notes to other claims against us or any Guarantors under the principle of equitable
subordination if the court determines that (i) the holder of Notes engaged in some type of
inequitable conduct, (ii) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or
conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Notes and (iii) equitable subordination is not
inconsistent with the provisions of the bankruptcy code.

**_If any of our subsidiaries guarantees the Notes, such Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantee of_**
**_the Notes may be reduced to zero, voided or released under certain circumstances and you_**
**_may not receive any payments from some or all of the Guarantors._**

When the Notes are first issued they will not be guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and none
of our subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the Notes in the future, except under the
circumstances described in “Description of the Notes—Possible Future Guarantees,” subject to
release of any such subsidiary from its obligations under such Guarantee as described in “Description
of the Notes—Possible Future Guarantees” and to the automatic and permanent release and
termination of all such Guarantees as described in “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
Covenant Termination.” If the Notes are ever guaranteed, the obligations of each Guarantor
under its Guarantee of the Notes will be limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the
obligations of such Guarantor under such Guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer under applicable federal, foreign or state laws. By virtue of this limitation, a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee of the Notes could be significantly less than amounts
due and payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have no obligation under its
Guarantee of the Notes. Moreover, this limitation may not be effective to protect any Guarantees
from being voided under fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar laws or to
prevent that Guarantor’s obligation from being reduced to an amount that effectively makes its


-----

Guarantee worthless. Furthermore, the Notes will lose the benefit of a particular Guarantee
thereof if it is released under the circumstances described in “Description of the Notes—Possible
Future Guarantees” or permanently released and terminated under the circumstances described in
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Covenant Termination.” You will not have a
claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that does not guarantee the Notes or whose Guarantee
of the Notes has been released or terminated, and the indebtedness, guarantees and other
liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, and preferred equity of those
subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of holders of the Notes.

**_There is no public market for the Notes._**

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Notes may only be
offered or sold in transactions that are not subject to, or that are otherwise exempt from, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or pursuant
to an effective registration statement. Prior to this offering, there was no trading market for the
Notes and we cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the Notes or, if one
does develop, that it will be maintained. If the Notes are traded after their initial issuance, they
may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates,
the market for similar securities, our performance and other factors. Historically, there has been
substantial volatility in the prices of corporate debt securities, and the price of the Notes is likely to
be affected by factors which affect the price of corporate debt securities generally. In addition,
the trading prices of fixed rate debt securities like the Notes generally tend to decline as interest
rates rise and governmental action, economic conditions or other factors that cause an increase in
interest rates generally may have an adverse effect on the trading price of the Notes. We do not
intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes on
any automated quotation system. Although certain of the Initial Purchasers have informed us
that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so, and they may
discontinue market making activities at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you
that a liquid market for the Notes will develop or be maintained.

**_There are restrictions on transfers of the Notes and holders of the Notes will not be entitled to_**
**_registration rights._**

The offering of the Notes by us has not been registered under the Securities Act or any state or
other securities laws and the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to require us to offer to
exchange the Notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act or to register
the Notes for resale under the Securities Act. The Notes are being offered and sold only to
persons reasonably believed to be QIBs and non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act. As a result, the Notes may be transferred or resold
only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws. In the absence of such registration or exemption, your
ability to transfer the Notes will be significantly restricted.

**_Redemption may adversely affect your return on the Notes._**

We have the right to redeem some or all of the Notes, at any time in whole or from time to time
in part prior to their maturity, as described under “Description of the Notes—Optional
Redemption.” We may redeem Notes at times when market interest rates may be lower than
market interest rates as of the closing of this offering (the “Issue Date”). Accordingly, if we redeem
Notes, you may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an
effective interest rate as high as that on the Notes.

**_We are not contractually committed to allocate the net proceeds from this offering to Eligible_**
**_Green and/or Social Projects, and our failure to do so could adversely impact the value of the_**
**_Notes._**

The market price of the Notes may be impacted by any failure by us to allocate the net proceeds
from this offering to Eligible Green and/or Social Projects or to meet or continue to meet the


-----

investment requirements of certain environmentally or socially focused investors with respect to
the Notes. Although we intend to allocate all of the net proceeds from this offering to Eligible
Green and/or Social Projects as described herein under “Use of Proceeds,” there can be no
assurance that the relevant project(s) or use(s) the subject of, or related to, any Eligible Green
and/or Social Projects will be capable of being implemented in or substantially in such manner
and/or accordance with any timing schedule and that accordingly such proceeds will be totally or
partially disbursed for such Eligible Green and/or Social Projects. Nor can there be any assurance
that such Eligible Green and/or Social Projects will be completed within any specified period or at
all or with the results or outcome as originally expected or anticipated by us. In addition, none
of the Initial Purchasers for this offering are responsible for assessing or verifying whether or not
the Eligible Green and/or Social Projects to which we allocate the net proceeds of the Notes
meet the criteria described in “Use of Proceeds,” or for the monitoring of the use of proceeds.
Any such event or failure by us will not constitute an Event of Default under the Notes.

**_There can be no assurance that the use of proceeds of the Notes to finance Eligible Green and/or_**
**_Social Projects will be suitable for the investment criteria of an investor._**

It is our intention to apply an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering specifically for
Eligible Green and/or Social Projects. Prospective investors should review the information set out
in this offering memorandum regarding such use of proceeds and must determine for themselves
the relevance of such information for the purpose of any investment in the Notes, together
with any other investigation such investor deems necessary. In particular, no assurance is given by
us or any Initial Purchaser that the use of such net proceeds for any Eligible Green and/or Social
Project will satisfy, whether in whole or in part, any present or future investor expectations or
requirements as regards any investment criteria or guidelines with which such investor or its
investments are required to comply, whether by any present or future applicable law or regulations
or by its own by-laws or other governing rules or investment portfolio mandates, in particular
with regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or social impact of any projects
or uses, the subject of or related to, any Eligible Green and/or Social Projects.

Furthermore, it should be noted that there is currently no clearly defined definition (legal,
regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, a “green”, “social”,
“sustainable” or an equivalently labelled project or as to what precise attributes are required for
a particular project to be defined as “green”, “social”, “sustainable” or such other equivalent
label nor can any assurance be given that such a clear definition or consensus will develop over
time. Accordingly, no assurance is or can be given to investors that any projects or uses the subject
of, or related to, any Eligible Green and/or Social Projects will meet any or all investor expectations
regarding such “green”, “social”, “sustainable” or other equivalently-labelled performance
objectives or that any adverse environmental, social and/or other impacts will not occur during
the implementation of any projects or uses the subject of, or related to, any Eligible Green and/or
Social Projects.

**_Recent changes as well as future changes in U.S. federal income tax law could affect your_**
**_investment in the Notes._**

The rules dealing with federal income taxation are subject to revision by persons involved in the
legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and the U.S. Department of the
Treasury. New legislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court
decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of such qualification. In addition, legislation, regulations and other
guidance has been enacted to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Coronavirus Aid,
Relief, and Economic Security Act, and further legislative enactments and other IRS or Treasury
action is possible. Furthermore, no prediction can be made as to the likelihood of passage of new
tax legislation or other provisions, or the direct or indirect effect on us, our stockholders or


-----

investors in our Notes, such as the Biden Administration’s proposal to modify key aspects of the
tax Code, including by increasing corporate and individual tax rates. Prospective investors are urged
to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of changes to the U.S. federal tax laws prior to
purchasing the Notes.

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the Indenture by beneficial owners with short_**
**_positions in excess of their interests in the Notes will be disregarded._**

By acceptance of the Notes, each holder of Notes agrees, in connection with any notice of
default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of default, notice
of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”), to (i) deliver a written
representation to us and the Trustee that such holder and any of its affiliates acting in concert
with it in connection with its investment in the Notes (other than screened affiliates) are not (or,
in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial
owners that (together with such affiliates) are not) Net Short (as defined under “Description of
the Notes—Certain Definitions”) and (ii) provide us with such other information as we may
reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s representation
within five business days of request therefor. These restrictions may impact a holder’s ability to
participate in Noteholder Directions if it is unable to make such a representation.

### Use of proceeds

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $ million, after
deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts and commissions and other estimated offering
expenses payable by us. We intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from this
offering to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, recently completed or future eligible projects
that meet the eligibility criteria described below (such projects, “Eligible Green and/or Social
Projects”) in alignment with the four core pillars of the Green Bond Principles, 2018, Social Bond
Principles, 2020 and Sustainability Bond Guidelines, 2018. Net proceeds allocated to previously
incurred costs associated with Eligible Green and/or Social Projects will be available for the
repayment of indebtedness previously incurred. Pending full allocation of an amount equal to
the net proceeds to Eligible Green and/or Social Projects, we intend to use the entire net proceeds
to fund, in part, the redemption of our December 2021 Senior Notes (such initial use of proceeds,
the “Initial Use of Proceeds”). Prior to such use, we may use the net proceeds from this offering for
general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our
repurchase facilities. To the extent we use the net proceeds from this offering to repay outstanding
indebtedness under our repurchase facilities prior to the use described in the prior sentence, we
would expect to re-borrow the amount repaid under such repurchase facilities later in 2021 to fund
a portion of the redemption of our December 2021 Senior Notes.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are lenders and/or agents under our outstanding
indebtedness, and may therefore receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to the
extent used to repay such outstanding indebtedness.

##### Our December 2021 Senior Notes

Our December 2021 Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2021 and, as of March 31, 2021,
approximately $700 million aggregate principal amount of our December 2021 Senior Notes were
outstanding. Our December 2021 Senior Notes may be redeemed without the payment of a
premium on or after September 15, 2021, and we currently intend to redeem our December 2021
Senior Notes on or after such date. This offering memorandum does not constitute a notice of
redemption of our December 2021 Senior Notes.

To the extent that any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates own any of our December 2021
Senior Notes, upon the Initial Use of Proceeds, such Initial Purchasers or their affiliates will receive
a portion of those net proceeds. See “Plan of Distribution—Other Relationships.”

##### Eligible Green and/or Social Projects

Eligible Green and/or Social Projects include investments in, financings of and/or acquisitions of
one or more of the following:

- Renewable Energy, including development, construction, acquisition, maintenance and
operation of renewable energy, such as solar, wind, geothermal, run-of-river hydropower, and
small-scale hydropower (less than or equal to 20 MW) and waste to energy projects. Renewable
energy investments may include those made up to three years before the issuance date of the
Notes.

- Green Buildings, including the development, construction, installation, operation, financing,
acquisition, maintenance, upgrades and associated costs of new or existing commercial or
residential buildings, including buildings that meet regional, national or internationallyrecognized standards or certifications (e.g., LEED Silver, Gold or Platinum). Green building
investments may include those made up to three years before the issuance date of the Notes.


-----

- Affordable Housing, including multi-family properties, where approximately 98% of the
project’s units are reserved for or restricted to households earning 60% or less of the household
medium income for the region in which each property is located. Affordable housing
investments may include those made up to five years before the issuance date of the Notes.

Exclusions: hydropower projects that are not run-of-river, hydropower projects greater than
20 MW, activities related to the exploration, production or transportation of fossil fuels (e.g., coal,
oil and gas) and consumption of fossil fuels for the purpose of power generation.

We expect to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering to Eligible Green
and/or Social Projects as soon as reasonably practicable after the Issue Date and before the maturity
date of the Notes.

##### Process for project evaluation and selection

Our investment committee will evaluate projects for eligibility based on the criteria described
above and recommend the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering among Eligible Green
and/or Social Projects for review and approval by our finance team.

##### Management of proceeds

Our finance team will track the amount of net proceeds from this offering allocated to Eligible
Green and/or Social Projects. Pending full allocation of an amount equal to the net proceeds to
Eligible Green and/or Social Projects, we intend to use the net proceeds for the Initial Use of
Proceeds, as described above.

##### Reporting

Annually, until an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering have been fully allocated
to Eligible Green and/or Social Projects, we intend to publish on our website a Green Bond
Report that will include (i) the amount of net proceeds allocated, (ii) a selection of brief descriptions
of relevant Eligible Green and/or Social Projects and, where feasible, their expected impact
metrics, for example, CO2 equivalent emissions avoided and/or GWh of annual generation and
(iii) the remaining amount of net proceeds yet to be allocated to Eligible Green and/or Social
Projects at the end of the reporting period.

Information contained in, or accessible through, our website and in our Green Bond Report is not
incorporated in, and is not part of, this offering memorandum or any other report or filing we
make with the SEC. Neither the Notes nor the indenture requires us to use the net proceeds from
the sale of the Notes as described above, and any failure by us to comply with the foregoing
will not constitute a breach of or default under the Notes or the indenture. The above description
of the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes is not intended to modify or add any
covenant or other contractual obligation undertaken by us under the Notes or the indenture
governing the Notes.

##### External review

The annual Green Bond Report will be accompanied by (i) an assertion by our manager that an
amount equal to the specified portion of the net proceeds from this offering was allocated to
Eligible Green and/or Social Projects and (ii) a report from an independent registered public
accounting firm in respect of its examination of management’s assertions conducted in accordance
with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

### Description of the notes

The % Senior Notes due 2026 will be issued under an Indenture dated as of the Issue Date
between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Company
will issue the Notes in a private transaction that is not registered under the Securities Act and
the Notes will initially be subject to certain transfer restrictions. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The following is a description of certain provisions of the Indenture and the Notes. It does not
include all of the provisions of the Indenture and the Notes. We urge you to read the Indenture
because it defines your rights. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and
those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the
“TIA”). You may obtain a copy of the form of the Indenture (which includes the form of the
Notes) as described under “Where You Can Find More Information.”

For purposes of this section, references to the “Company, “us,” “we,” “our” and similar references
include only Starwood Property Trust, Inc. and not its subsidiaries or any other entities that are
consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. You can find definitions of certain
capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under “—Certain Definitions.”

##### General

The Notes we issue on the Issue Date will be limited to an aggregate principal amount of
$400 million. We may issue an unlimited principal amount of Additional Notes under the Indenture
having identical terms as the Notes initially issued under the Indenture on the Issue Date (other
than issue date, and, if applicable, issue price, the first interest payment date and the date from
which interest will accrue, and except that any such Additional Notes may, but need not, be subject
to or include transfer restrictions), provided that if any Additional Notes are not fungible with
the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Additional
Notes will have separate CUSIP and ISIN numbers from the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date.
We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the terms of the
Indenture, including the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness.” The Notes and any Additional Notes subsequently issued
under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture for
purposes of, among other things, payments of principal and interest, Events of Default (as defined
below under “—Events of Default”), Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance (as those terms
are defined below under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance”), satisfaction and
discharge, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless otherwise expressly
stated or the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes” section references to the
Notes include any Additional Notes.

The Company will issue the Notes in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of
$2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will initially be issued in bookentry form evidenced by one or more global Notes (“Global Notes”) registered in the name of
the Depositary or its nominee and Notes in definitive certificated form (“certificated Notes”) will
only be issued under the limited circumstances described under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”
The Trustee will initially act as paying agent and registrar for the Notes. The Notes may be
presented for registration of transfer and exchange at the office of the registrar. The Company
may change any paying agent and registrar and may appoint additional paying agents and
registrars without notice to Holders of the Notes. The Company will pay principal (and premium,
if any) on, and may pay interest on, any certificated Notes at the office or agency maintained by the
Company for such purpose in the United States of America, which initially shall be an office of
the Trustee, upon surrender of such certificated Notes by the Holders thereof at such office or
agency. Interest on any certificated Notes may also be paid, at the Company’s option, by check


-----

mailed to the registered addresses of the Holders entitled thereto or by wire transfer to accounts
in the United States of America specified by such Holders. The Company will pay the principal,
premium, if any, and interest on Global Notes registered in the name of the Depositary or its
nominee in immediately available funds to the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as
Holder of such Global Notes.

##### Principal, maturity and interest

The Notes will mature on, 2026. The Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of any
mandatory sinking fund.

Interest on the Notes will be payable semiannually in arrears in cash at a rate of % per
annum. Interest will be paid on the Notes on each and, commencing on
, to the persons who are Holders of record of the Notes on the preceding
and, respectively, whether or not a Business Day. Interest on the Notes will accrue
from the Issue Date and will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day
months.

If any interest payment date, Redemption Date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date
or any other date on which payment on any Notes is due is not a Business Day, the required payment
will be postponed and made on the next succeeding Business Day as if made on the date such
payment was due, and no interest will accrue on such payment for the period from and after such
interest payment date, Redemption Date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or
other date, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Business Day.
Interest on the Notes offered hereby will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has
been paid or duly provided for on the Notes or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for on
the Notes, from and including the Issue Date.

##### Transfer and exchange

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in
connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The
Company is not required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before the
mailing (or, if not mailed, other transmittal) of a notice of redemption of Notes.

##### Ranking

The Notes will be:

- senior unsecured obligations of the Company;

- pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and
senior unsecured guarantees of the Company;

- effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness
and secured guarantees of the Company to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
indebtedness and guarantees;

- senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness and subordinated guarantees of
the Company; and

- effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness, guarantees
and other liabilities (including trade payables) and any preferred equity of the Company’s
Subsidiaries (other than any Subsidiaries that may become Guarantors of the Notes as described
below).


-----

On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed by any of our Subsidiaries and none of our
Subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the Notes in the future, except under the circumstances
described under “—Possible Future Guarantees” below. In the event that any of our Subsidiaries
becomes a Guarantor of the Notes, its Guarantee of the Notes will be:

- a senior unsecured obligation of such Guarantor;

- pari passu in right of payment with all senior unsecured indebtedness and senior unsecured
guarantees of such Guarantor;

- effectively subordinated in right of payment to all secured indebtedness and secured guarantees
of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and
guarantees; and

- senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness and subordinated guarantees of
such Guarantor.

As a holding company, substantially all of our business is conducted through our Subsidiaries,
which are separate and distinct legal entities and, except in the case of our Subsidiaries, if any,
that may guarantee the Notes in the future under the circumstances described below, have no
contractual or other obligations to make payments due on the Notes or to provide funds to us for
that purpose. Therefore, our ability to make payments due on the Notes and to meet our other
cash needs is dependent on the earnings of, and the distribution of funds (whether by dividend,
distribution, loan or otherwise) to us by, our Subsidiaries. The availability of funds from our
Subsidiaries will depend upon, among other things, their operating results, financial condition
and legal or contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and distributions or make loans
to us. We cannot assure you that our Subsidiaries will have sufficient funds, or that agreements
governing the existing and future indebtedness of our Subsidiaries will not restrict or prevent our
Subsidiaries from providing us with sufficient funds, to make payments on the Notes when due
and to meet our other cash needs, and the Indenture will not restrict our Subsidiaries from entering
into such restrictive agreements. Furthermore, we guarantee many of the obligations of our
subsidiaries and such guarantees may require us to provide substantial funds or assets to our
subsidiaries or their creditors at a time when we need liquidity to fund our own obligations, such
as the Notes. In addition, the Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all
existing and future indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities (including trade payables) and
preferred equity of our Subsidiaries (other than any Subsidiaries that may become Guarantors of
the Notes as described below). In that regard, certain of the Company’s Subsidiaries are borrowers
or guarantors under the Existing Credit Agreements and the Existing Repurchase Agreements and
the Notes will therefore be effectively subordinated in in right of payment to the indebtedness
and guarantees of such Subsidiaries under the Existing Credit Agreements and the Existing
Repurchase Agreements. If any of our Subsidiaries guarantees the Notes, the terms of the Existing
Convertible Senior Notes require that such Subsidiary also guarantee the Existing Convertible
Senior Notes, and we may in the future enter into other debt instruments with similar requirements.
In addition, the Existing Senior Notes include a covenant substantially similar to the covenant
described below under “—Possible Future Guarantees,” which could require any of our Domestic
Subsidiaries (other than Excluded Subsidiaries and Securitization Entities) that guarantees the
Notes offered hereby to also guarantee the Existing Senior Notes. Furthermore, the Notes and any
Guarantees of the Notes by our Subsidiaries will be unsecured and therefore will not have the
benefit of any collateral. Accordingly, the Notes and any Guarantees of the Notes will be effectively
subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness and secured
guarantees of us and any Guarantors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured
indebtedness and secured guarantees. In that regard, the Company is a borrower under the
Term Loan Credit Agreement and a guarantor under the Revolving Facility Credit Agreement,
and the Company has pledged certain of its equity interests to secure its Indebtedness under the


-----

Term Loan Credit Agreement and its guarantee under the Revolving Facility Credit Agreement.
Therefore, the Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to such indebtedness and
guarantee to the extent of the value of the equity interests securing such indebtedness and
guarantee.

For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and to this Offering—
Our ability to repay our debt, including the Notes, depends on the performance of our subsidiaries
and their ability to make distributions to us,” “—Risks Related to the Notes and to this Offering—
The Notes and any Guarantees will be unsecured and effectively subordinated in right of
payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness and secured guarantees of us and any
Guarantors, respectively, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured indebtedness
and secured guarantees” and “—Risks Related to the Notes and to this Offering—The Notes will
be effectively subordinated in right of payment to the indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities
(including trade payables) and preferred equity of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the
Notes and any of our subsidiaries that guarantees the Notes will also be required to guarantee
certain debt in addition to the Notes.”

##### Possible future guarantees

On the Issue Date, none of our Subsidiaries will be a Guarantor of the Notes. The Indenture will
provide that if, on any date (a “Guarantee Date”), the aggregate Guaranteed Principal Amount of
any Domestic Subsidiary of the Company (other than a Domestic Subsidiary of the Company that
is an Excluded Subsidiary or a Securitization Entity) exceeds $2.5 million, the Company will cause
such Domestic Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after such
Guarantee Date (except as set forth in the proviso below), a supplemental indenture pursuant to
which such Domestic Subsidiary will unconditionally guarantee the payment of the Notes, jointly
and severally with all other Guarantors (if any) of the Notes; provided that, if a Domestic
Subsidiary that would have been required to guarantee the Notes but for the fact that it was an
Excluded Subsidiary or a Securitization Entity shall be required to guarantee the Notes because it
shall have ceased to be an Excluded Subsidiary or a Securitization Entity, or if a Subsidiary that
was a Foreign Subsidiary shall be required to guarantee the Notes because it shall have become a
Domestic Subsidiary that is not an Excluded Subsidiary or a Securitization Entity, as the case may
be, the supplemental indenture referred to above shall be delivered to the Trustee within 30 days
after the date such Domestic Subsidiary shall have ceased to be an Excluded Subsidiary or a
Securitization Entity or such Foreign Subsidiary shall have become a Domestic Subsidiary that is
not an Excluded Subsidiary or Securitization Entity, as the case may be. Anything in the Indenture
to the contrary notwithstanding, no Excluded Subsidiary, Securitization Entity or Foreign
Subsidiary shall be required to guarantee the Notes or become a Guarantor.

The Indenture will provide that the covenant described in the immediately preceding paragraph
will automatically and permanently terminate and the Company will be automatically and
permanently released from all of its obligations under such covenant under the circumstances
described below under “—Certain Covenants—Covenant Termination” and, if that occurs, all
Guarantees (if any) of the Notes and all obligations of each Guarantor (if any) under its Guarantee
of the Notes and the Indenture will be automatically and permanently terminated and released.
For additional information, see “—Certain Covenants—Covenant Termination” below.

The Indenture will provide that the obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee of the
Notes will be limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the obligations of such Guarantor
under its Guarantee of the Notes constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer
under applicable federal, foreign or state laws. The Indenture will also provide that the limitation
described in the immediately preceding sentence shall survive any covenant termination described
below under “—Certain Covenants—Covenant Termination” and remain in full force and effect. By


-----

virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee of the Notes could be
significantly less than amounts due and payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may
have no obligation under its Guarantee of the Notes. Moreover, this limitation may not be effective
to protect any Guarantees from being voided under fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer
or similar laws or to prevent that Guarantor’s obligation from being reduced to an amount that
effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and to
this Offering—Federal and state laws may permit courts, under specific circumstances, to void the
Notes and/or any Guarantees as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, subordinate claims in
respect of the Notes and/or any Guarantees and require you to return payments received. If that
occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes or any Guarantees.” and “Risk Factors—
Risks Related to the Notes and to this Offering—If any of our Subsidiaries guarantees the Notes,
such Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantee may be reduced to zero, voided or released under
certain circumstances, and you may not receive any payments from some or all of the Guarantors.”

A Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Notes will automatically terminate and be released, all other
obligations of such Guarantor under the Indenture will automatically terminate and such
Guarantor will automatically be released from all of its obligations under its Guarantee of the
Notes and the Indenture:

(1) upon the sale or other disposition of Capital Stock of such Guarantor, or any merger or
consolidation of such Guarantor with or into any Person, which results in such Guarantor no
longer being a Subsidiary of the Company or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the
assets of such Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Domestic Subsidiary of the Company
that is not an Excluded Subsidiary or a Securitization Entity) so long as such sale, disposition,
merger or consolidation is permitted (or not prohibited) by the Indenture;

(2) upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers’ Certificate to the effect that such
Guarantor is an Excluded Subsidiary, a Securitization Entity or a Foreign Subsidiary (it being
understood that the Company may deliver such Officers’ Certificate in respect of any Domestic
Subsidiary that is a Guarantor if such Domestic Subsidiary subsequently becomes an Excluded
Subsidiary, a Securitization Entity or a Foreign Subsidiary);

(3) upon Legal Defeasance, Covenant Defeasance or discharge of the Notes as provided in
“—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” as
applicable;

(4) if such Guarantor is dissolved or liquidated and such dissolution or liquidation is not an Event
of Default (excluding an Event of Default under clause (6) of the first paragraph under the
caption “—Events of Default”);

(5) upon the merger of such Guarantor into, or the consolidation of such Guarantor with, (a) a
Subsidiary of the Company if the surviving or resulting entity is an Excluded Subsidiary,
Securitization Entity or Foreign Subsidiary or (b) the Company or another Guarantor;

(6) if at any time the outstanding Guaranteed Principal Amount of such Guarantor (provided
that, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, any Debt Securities that would otherwise
be included in calculating such Guaranteed Principal Amount shall be excluded from such
calculation if (x) such Guarantor’s guarantee of such Debt Securities will be released, terminated,
suspended or discharged, (y) such Debt Securities will be repaid, repurchased, defeased,
redeemed or otherwise discharged or otherwise will cease to be outstanding or (z) such Debt
Securities will cease to meet the requirements for inclusion under clause (a), (b), (c), or
(d) of the definition of “Guaranteed Principal Amount,” in each case contemporaneously
with the termination of such Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Notes) shall be less than or equal
to $2.5 million, whether as a result of the release, termination, suspension or discharge of such


-----

Guarantor’s guarantee of any Debt Securities, the repayment, repurchase, defeasance,
redemption or other discharge of any Debt Securities, the release, termination, suspension or
discharge of the Company’s guarantee of any Guaranteed Subsidiary Debt Securities, or
otherwise;

(7) under the circumstances described in the last paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—
Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” or if such Guarantor shall cease to be a Subsidiary
of the Company; or

(8) under the circumstances described under “—Certain Covenants—Covenant Termination”
below.

Our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts
due on the Notes or to make any funds available to the Company to pay those amounts, whether
by dividend, distribution, loan or otherwise. See “—Ranking” above and “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Notes and to this Offering—The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of
payment to the indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities (including trade payables) and
preferred equity of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and any of our subsidiaries
that guarantees the Notes will also be required to guarantee certain debt in addition to the Notes.”

##### Optional redemption

Prior to, (the “Par Call Date”), the Notes may be redeemed in whole or in
part at the Company’s option at any time and from time to time at a price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued but unpaid interest, if
any, to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date (subject to the right of the Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on any interest payment date falling
on or prior to such Redemption Date).

On and after the Par Call Date, the Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at the Company’s
option at any time and from time to time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption
Date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on any interest payment date falling on or prior to such Redemption Date).

Prior to,, the Company will be entitled at its option on one or more occasions
to redeem the Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 40% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes) originally issued prior to the
applicable Redemption Date at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of the principal
amount of the Notes to be redeemed) of %, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the applicable Redemption Date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on any interest payment date falling on or prior to
such Redemption Date), with the Net Cash Proceeds from one or more Qualified Equity Offerings;
provided, however, that:

(1) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes (including any Additional Notes)
originally issued prior to the applicable Redemption Date remains outstanding immediately
after the occurrence of each such redemption (other than Notes held, directly or indirectly, by
the Company or any of its Affiliates); and

(2) each such redemption occurs within 180 days after the date of the closing of the related
Qualified Equity Offering.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer or Change of Control Offer
for the Notes, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding


-----

Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such offer and the Company, or
any third party making an offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right,
upon not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 60 days
following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such
purchase at a price in cash equal to the price offered to each other Holder of the Notes in such
offer (which may be less than par) plus, to the extent not included in the offer payment, accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date).

Any redemption of the Notes may, in the Company’s sole discretion, be subject to one or more
conditions precedent, which shall be described in the related notice of redemption to Holders of
Notes, which conditions may include, without limitation, completion of one or more Qualified
Equity Offerings or other securities offerings or other financings, transactions or events. If such
redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice to Holders
of Notes may (at the option of the Company) include a statement to the effect that the
Redemption Date may be delayed, on one or more occasions and in the Company’s sole discretion,
either (at the Company’s option) to a date specified by the Company in such notice or in a
subsequent notice to such Holders (subject, if the Company shall so elect, to satisfaction of any or
all such conditions or the Company’s written waiver of any such conditions that are not satisfied)
or until such time as any or all of such conditions have been satisfied or waived by the Company in
writing, and that, if any such conditions shall not have been satisfied as and when required (as
determined by the Company in its sole discretion and taking into account any election by the
Company to delay such Redemption Date), then (unless the Company shall have waived in writing
any such conditions that are not satisfied), the Company shall have no obligation to redeem the
Notes called for redemption on such Redemption Date (as the same may have been delayed by the
Company as aforesaid) and may cancel such proposed redemption and rescind any notice of
such redemption. In order to delay any Redemption Date (or to further delay any delayed
Redemption Date (as defined below)), the Company shall provide written notice to the Trustee,
at least two Business Days before such Redemption Date (or such delayed Redemption Date, as the
case may be), to the effect that the Company has elected to delay such Redemption Date (or
such delayed Redemption Date, as the case may be) and specifying the new Redemption Date (a
“delayed Redemption Date”) (which may, at the Company’s option, be specified as the date on
which any or all conditions to such redemption are satisfied (as determined by the Company in
its sole discretion) or waived by the Company), and the Trustee shall provide such notice to each
Holder of the Notes that were to be redeemed in the same manner in which the notice of
redemption was given. The Company may delay any Redemption Date on one or more occasions.

If all conditions precedent (if any) to any redemption of the Notes shall not have been satisfied
as and when required (as determined by the Company in its sole discretion and taking into account
any election by the Company to delay such Redemption Date) or waived by the Company in
writing and the Company has not elected to delay (or further delay) the applicable Redemption
Date (or the applicable delayed Redemption Date, as the case may be), the Company shall provide
written notice to the effect that the Company has elected to cancel such redemption to the
Trustee prior to close of business two Business Days prior to such Redemption Date (or such delayed
Redemption Date, as the case may be). Upon the Trustee’s receipt of such notice, the notice of
such redemption shall be automatically rescinded and such redemption shall be automatically
cancelled and the Company shall have no obligation to redeem the Notes called for redemption.
Promptly after receipt of such notice, the Trustee shall provide such notice to each Holder of the
Notes that were to have been redeemed in the same manner in which the notice of redemption
was given.


-----

“Applicable Premium” means, with respect to any Note on any Redemption Date for such Note,
the greater of: (1) 1.0% of the principal amount of such Note and (2) the excess, if any, of (a) the
present value as of such Redemption Date of (i) the redemption price of such Note on the Par
Call Date (such redemption price being 100% of the principal amount of such Note) plus (ii) all
required remaining scheduled interest payments due on such Note to, but excluding, the Par Call
Date, excluding accrued but unpaid interest to such Redemption Date, computed using a
discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, over (b) the principal amount of
such Note. Calculation of the Applicable Premium and the Treasury Rate will be made by the
Company or on behalf of the Company by such Person as the Company shall designate; provided,
however, that such calculation shall not be a duty or obligation of the Trustee.

“Treasury Rate” means, with respect to a Redemption Date for any Note, the average of the
yields to maturity for the five most recent business days (or, if such yields are not published for all
five such business days, for those business days for which such yields are published) appearing in
the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer
published, any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Company in its
sole discretion) that is publicly available at least two Business Days prior to the first day on which
the Company mails or otherwise transmits the notice of redemption (or, in the case of redemption
in connection with Legal Defeasance, Covenant Defeasance or satisfaction and discharge as
described below under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and
Discharge,” as applicable, at least two Business Days prior to the deposit of trust funds with the
Trustee in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture) of United States Treasury
securities with a constant maturity most nearly equal to the period from such Redemption Date
to the Par Call Date; provided, however, that if such period is not equal to the constant maturity of
the United States Treasury security for which a yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained
by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the yields of United
States Treasury securities for which such yields are given, except that if such period is less than
one year, the yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant
maturity of one year shall be used.

In the event that the Company chooses to redeem less than all of the Notes, selection of the
Notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee pro rata or by lot; provided that, in the case of
Notes represented by one or more Global Notes, interests in such Global Notes will be selected
for redemption by the Depositary in accordance with its applicable procedures therefor.

Notes shall be redeemed in a minimum principal amount of $2,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof; provided that the remaining principal amount of any Note redeemed in
part shall be $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notice of redemption
will be mailed by first-class mail, or, if the Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes and
if the Depositary’s applicable procedures so provide, transmitted in accordance with the
Depositary’s applicable procedures therefor, at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the
Redemption Date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed at its registered address (or at such
address as may be provided by the Depositary’s applicable procedures). On and after the
Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption
as long as the Company has deposited with the paying agent funds in satisfaction of the applicable
redemption price.

##### Mandatory redemption; open market and other purchases

Except as described below under “—Change of Control,” we will not be required to make any
mandatory redemption, mandatory repurchase or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
We may at any time and from time to time acquire Notes by means other than a redemption,


-----

whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in
accordance with applicable securities laws.

##### Change of control

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, each Holder of Notes will have the
right (unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described under
“—Optional Redemption” above by sending a notice of redemption) to require that the Company
purchase all or a portion of such Holder’s Notes pursuant to the offer described below (a “Change
of Control Offer”) at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof
plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable Change of Control Payment
Date referred to below (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on any interest payment date falling on or prior to the Change of Control
Payment Date (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”).

Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have
occurred, the Company must (unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all of the
Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” above by sending a notice of redemption)
send, by first class mail, a notice to each Holder of Notes (or, in the case of Global Notes, send such
notice in accordance with the applicable procedures, if any, of the Depositary), with a copy to
the Trustee, which notice shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice shall
state:

- that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the Indenture and that all Notes
that are validly tendered and not withdrawn will be accepted for payment;

- the Change of Control Purchase Price and the purchase date, which must be a Business Day no
earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (or otherwise
transmitted), other than as may be required by law (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

- that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

- that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to
accrue interest on and after the Change of Control Payment Date (unless the Company shall
default in the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price of the Notes) and the only
remaining right of the Holder will be to receive payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price
upon surrender of the applicable Note to the paying agent;

- that Holders electing to have a portion of a Note purchased pursuant to a Change of Control
Offer may only elect to have such Note purchased in denominations of $2,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, provided that the remaining principal amount of any such
Note surrendered for repurchase in part shall be $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in
excess thereof;

- that if a Holder elects to have a Note purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer it will
be required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase”
on the reverse of the Note duly completed, to the Person and at the address specified in the
notice (or, in the case of Global Notes, to surrender the Note and provide the information
required by such form in accordance with the applicable procedures, if any, of the Depositary)
prior to the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment
Date;

- that a Holder will be entitled to withdraw its election if the Company receives, not later than
the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date,
a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of such Holder, the principal amount of


-----

Notes such Holder delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its
election to have such Notes purchased; and

- that if any Note is purchased only in part a new Note will be issued in principal amount equal
to the unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered.

On or before the Change of Control Payment Date for the Notes, the Company will, to the extent
lawful:

- accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes (in denominations of $2,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer, provided that if, following repurchase of a portion of a Note, the
remaining principal amount thereof would be less than $2,000, then the portion of such Note so
repurchased shall be reduced so that the remaining principal amount of such Note outstanding
immediately after such repurchase is $2,000;

- deposit with a paying agent an amount equal to the payment due in respect of all Notes or
portions thereof so tendered and not withdrawn;

- deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted for
payment; and

- deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were
accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Indenture.

The Company, the depositary, if any, appointed by the Company for such Change of Control
Offer or a paying agent, as the case may be, shall promptly mail or deliver (or, in the case of Global
Notes, deliver in accordance with the applicable procedures, if any, of the Depositary) to each
tendering Holder an amount equal to the Change of Control Purchase Price of the Notes validly
tendered by such Holder and not withdrawn and accepted by the Company for purchase. Further,
the Company shall promptly issue a new Note, and the Trustee, upon written request from the
Company, shall authenticate and mail or deliver (including by book-entry transfer) such new Note
to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note accepted
for payment (it being understood that, notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary,
no Officers’ Certificate or opinion of counsel will be required for the Trustee to authenticate
and mail or deliver any such new Note). Any Note not so accepted shall be promptly mailed or
delivered (including by book-entry transfer) by the Company or the Trustee to the Holder thereof.

Interest on Notes (or portions thereof) validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to a Change
of Control Offer will cease to accrue on and after the applicable Change of Control Payment
Date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price
of the Notes).

If the Change of Control Payment Date is on or after a record date and on or before the related
interest payment date for the Notes, any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to, but excluding,
the Change of Control Payment Date will be paid to the Persons in whose names the applicable
Notes are registered at the close of business on the applicable record date.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer for the Notes upon a
Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the
manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture
that are applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything
in the Indenture to the contrary, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change
of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event conditioned upon the occurrence of such a


-----

Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement regarding
such Change of Control is in effect at the time of making the Change of Control Offer.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are
applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To
the extent that any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture
relating to a Change of Control Offer, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under such provisions
of the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event (including the definitions
relating thereto) and the terms of any such offer may, subject to the limitations described below
under “—Modification of the Notes, any Guarantees or the Indenture,” be waived or modified with
the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes.

The provisions described above may deter certain mergers, tender offers and other takeover
attempts involving the Company by increasing the capital required to effectuate such transactions.

The Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Notes may not provide Holders of
Notes protection in the event of highly leveraged transactions, reorganizations, restructurings,
takeovers, acquisitions, mergers, recapitalizations or similar transactions involving us that might
adversely affect holders of Notes. In particular, any such transaction may not give rise to a Change
of Control Triggering Event, in which case we would not be required to make a Change of
Control Offer. Except as described above, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit
the Holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of highly leveraged transactions, reorganizations, restructurings, takeovers, acquisitions, mergers,
recapitalizations or similar transactions involving us.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
assets (subject to certain exceptions) of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any
Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of such assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering
Event has occurred and whether the Company is required to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as described above.

More generally, courts interpreting change of control provisions under New York law (which is
the governing law of the Notes and the Indenture) have not provided a clear and consistent
meaning of such change of control provisions, and no assurance can be given as to how or if a court
would enforce the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions applicable to the Notes or
how those provisions would be impacted were we to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case.

We may be unable to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event because
we may not have sufficient funds available or we may be prohibited from doing so by the terms of
our other indebtedness. In that regard, the Existing Senior Notes include a covenant substantially
similar to the covenant applicable to the Notes as described under this caption “—Change of
Control.” In addition, a transaction constituting a Change of Control Triggering Event, Change of
Control or similar event and certain other events or transactions relating to, for example, the
composition of our board of directors, our adoption of a plan for liquidation or dissolution, a


-----

change in control in the Manager or the Manager ceasing to be our manager, constitute or may
constitute events of default or require or may require us to repay or offer to repurchase or repay
outstanding indebtedness under other existing or future credit agreements, repurchase
agreements, indentures or other instruments or agreements relating to indebtedness to which
we or any of our subsidiaries is or becomes a party. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will
have sufficient financial resources available to repurchase or repay Notes or other indebtedness
should we be required to do so upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event,
Change of Control or other event or transaction. Any failure to repurchase or repay any existing of
future indebtedness, should it become due and payable as the result of a Change of Control
Triggering Event, Change of Control or other event, would likely have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could result in the acceleration
of other indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries pursuant to cross-default and cross-acceleration
provisions. In addition, certain existing or future indebtedness of ours and our subsidiaries
requires or may require us or our subsidiaries to repay or offer to repurchase such indebtedness
upon the occurrence of certain changes of control or similar events which may not constitute a
Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Notes and to this Offering—Our ability to repurchase Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering
Event may be limited.”

Moreover, we will be required to offer to repurchase Notes only if both a Change of Control and
certain declines in the credit ratings on the Notes occur. By contrast, any requirement that we
repurchase or repay or offer to repurchase or repay, as applicable, indebtedness outstanding under
the Existing Repurchase Agreements, the Existing Convertible Senior Notes or the Existing Credit
Agreements upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (or similar event) or certain other events
relating to, for example, certain changes in the composition of our board of directors, our
adoption of a plan of liquidation or dissolution, a change in control in the Manager or the Manager
ceasing to be our manager, will arise, in each case, without any requirement that there also be a
decline in our credit rating, and other existing and future instruments and agreements relating to
indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries may have similar provisions. As a result, we may be
required to repay or repurchase or offer to repay or repurchase indebtedness outstanding under
the Existing Repurchase Agreements, the Existing Convertible Senior Notes, the Existing Credit
Agreements and other existing and future instruments and agreements relating to indebtedness
before we are required, or without our being required, to repurchase or offer to repurchase the
Notes.

##### Certain covenants

**_Covenant termination_**

The Indenture will contain the provisions described above under “—Possible Future Guarantees”
and below under this “—Certain Covenants” section. However, the Indenture will provide that the
provisions described above under “—Possible Future Guarantees” (other than the portions of
such covenant limiting the obligations of each Guarantor (if any) under its Guarantee of the Notes
as described in the third paragraph under such caption and the portions of such covenant
relating to the release of any Guarantor from its Guarantee of the Notes as described in the
fourth paragraph under such caption) and the provisions described below under “—Limitation on
Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness” and clauses (2) and (4) of the first paragraph under
“—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” (collectively, the “Terminated Covenants”) will
automatically and permanently terminate and will be of no further force or effect, and the
Company will be automatically and permanently released from all of its obligations thereunder,
on and after any date (the “Covenant Termination Date”) that (a) if there are two Applicable
Rating Agencies on the Covenant Termination Date, the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating
from both Applicable Rating Agencies or (ii) if there are three Applicable Rating Agencies on the


-----

Covenant Termination Date, the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating from at least two of the
Applicable Rating Agencies and (b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
with respect to the Notes, and thereafter any omission to comply with any of the Terminated
Covenants (or the Guarantees, if any, of the Notes, which Guarantees also shall be automatically
and permanently terminated and released as provided below) shall not constitute a breach, Default
or Event of Default under the Notes or the Indenture.

All of the Guarantees, if any, of the Notes will automatically and permanently terminate and will
be of no further force or effect, and all of the obligations of the Guarantors, if any, under such
Guarantees and the Indenture will be automatically and permanently released, on the Covenant
Termination Date.

The Indenture will provide that the Company shall deliver an Officers’ Certificate to the Trustee
notifying the Trustee of the Covenant Termination Date promptly (but in no event later than ten
Business Days) after such date, and that the Trustee shall have no obligation to monitor or
determine whether a Covenant Termination Date has occurred, provided that any failure by the
Company to deliver any such Officers’ Certificate shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default
or affect the automatic and permanent termination of the Terminated Covenants, Guarantees
(if any) of the Notes and other obligations described above on the Covenant Termination Date.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever receive an Investment Grade Rating from any
Rating Agency or, if they do, that such rating will be maintained.

**_Limitation on incurrence of additional Indebtedness_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable for payment
of (collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness (including, without limitation, Acquired Indebtedness)
other than Permitted Indebtedness and other than as provided in the next paragraph.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness
(including, without limitation, Acquired Indebtedness) if, on the date of the incurrence of such
Indebtedness and immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the
repayment, repurchase, defeasance, redemption or other discharge of any other Indebtedness
with the proceeds of the Indebtedness being so incurred or in connection with the transactions
pursuant to which such Indebtedness is being incurred, on a pro forma basis:

(1) the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company is greater than 1.5 to 1.0; and

(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a
consequence of incurring such Indebtedness.

**_Maintenance of Total Unencumbered Assets_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company will maintain Total Unencumbered Assets of not
less than 120% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Unsecured Indebtedness of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case determined on a consolidated basis in accordance
with GAAP.

**_Merger, consolidation and sale of assets_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, consolidate or merge with or into any Person, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company’s properties and assets determined
on a consolidated basis (other than (i) sales, assignments, transfers, leases, conveyances or other
dispositions of Securitization Assets, Repurchase Agreement Assets, Investments or other securities


-----

or assets, in each case in the ordinary course of business and (ii) any Required Asset Sale) to any
Person, unless:

(1) either

(a) the Company shall be the surviving or continuing Person; or

(b) the Person (if other than the Company) formed by such consolidation or into which the
Company is merged or the Person which acquires by sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition all or substantially all of the Company’s properties and
assets (the “Surviving Entity”):

(i) shall be an entity organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States
or any State thereof or the District of Columbia; and

(ii) shall expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the
Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and
interest on all of the Notes and the performance of every covenant in the Notes and the
Indenture on the part of the Company to be performed or observed;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and, if applicable, the assumption
contemplated by clause (1)(b)(ii) above (including giving pro forma effect to any Indebtedness
and Acquired Indebtedness incurred and any repayment, repurchase, defeasance, redemption
or other discharge of Indebtedness by the Company or the Surviving Entity, as the case may
be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with such transaction), the Company or
such Surviving Entity, as the case may be: (a) shall have a Consolidated Net Worth equal to
or greater than the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company immediately prior to such
transaction, in each case determined as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter ending on
or prior to the date of such transaction for which financial statements of the Company or
the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, are available; or (b) shall be able to incur at least $1.00
of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the second paragraph of the “—Limitation on
Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness” covenant; or (c) shall have a Consolidated Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio that is equal to or greater than the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio of the Company immediately prior to such transaction (the computations required by
clauses (b) and (c) above shall be computed on a pro forma basis giving effect to such transaction
as if it had occurred at the beginning of the most recent Four Quarter Period ended on or
prior to the date of such transaction for which financial statements of the Company or the
Surviving Entity, as the case may be, are available and the other pro forma adjustments set forth
in the definition of Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio). If the transaction involves a
Surviving Entity and the Company and the Surviving Entity have different fiscal quarters, then
the relevant Four Quarter Period and, for purposes of clause (a) of this paragraph (2), the
relevant fiscal quarter, may, at the election of the Company, be based on either the Company’s
or the Surviving Entity’s fiscal quarters;

(3) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness
that becomes an obligation of the Company or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, or
any of its Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having been incurred by the Company
or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction,
and any Indebtedness to be repaid, repurchased, defeased, redeemed or otherwise discharged
by the Company or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with such transaction as having been repaid, repurchased, defeased, redeemed or otherwise
discharged at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing;


-----

(4) if the Surviving Entity is not the Company, each Guarantor (unless it is the Surviving Entity, in
which case clause (1)(b) above shall apply) shall have by supplemental indenture confirmed
that its Guarantee of the Notes shall apply to such Surviving Entity’s obligations under the
Indenture and the Notes; and

(5) the Company or the Surviving Entity shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate
and an opinion of counsel (which opinion may be subject to customary assumptions,
limitations and exceptions), each stating that such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment,
transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition and, if a supplemental indenture is required in
connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture comply with the applicable
provisions of the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets”
covenant, any Subsidiary of the Company may merge or consolidate with or into or transfer all or
any part of its properties and assets to the Company or the Surviving Entity or any other Subsidiary
of the Company or the Surviving Entity and the foregoing provisions and, except in the case of a
merger or consolidation with or into the Company or the Surviving Entity, the last paragraph of
this “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” covenant shall not apply to any such transaction.

The Indenture will provide that, for purposes of the foregoing, the sale, assignment, transfer,
lease, conveyance or other disposition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company
(other than (i) sales, assignments, transfers, leases, conveyances or other dispositions of
Securitization Assets, Repurchase Agreement Assets, Investments or other securities or assets, in
each case in the ordinary course of business and (ii) any Required Asset Sale), the Capital Stock of
which constitutes all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a
consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties
and assets of the Company.

The Indenture will provide that, for purposes of clarity, it is understood and agreed that references
under this caption “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” to sales, assignments, transfers,
leases, conveyances or other dispositions of Securitization Assets, Repurchase Agreement Assets,
Investments or other securities or assets in the ordinary course of business shall include, without
limitation, any sales, assignments, transfers, leases, conveyances or other dispositions of
Securitization Assets, Repurchase Agreement Assets, Investments or other securities or assets
(1) that are made (x) to any Securitization Entity for the purpose of enabling such Securitization
Entity to securitize the assets so sold, assigned, transferred, leased, conveyed or disposed of or
enabling such Securitization Entity to issue Non-Recourse Indebtedness secured by such assets
or to enter into any Repurchase Agreements with respect to such assets or (y) to any Person
pursuant to a Repurchase Agreement that is otherwise permitted (or not prohibited) by the
Indenture, under which such Person is a buyer of Repurchase Agreement Assets, and (2) that the
Company in good faith determines to be consistent with past practice of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or to reflect customary or accepted practice in the businesses, industries or markets
in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries operates or reasonably expects to operate or that
reflect reasonable extensions, evolutions or developments of any of the foregoing (including,
without limitation, by way of new transactions or structures), and as a result, none of the foregoing
shall constitute a sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the Company’s properties and assets, on a consolidated basis or otherwise, for
purposes of the other paragraphs under this caption “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of
Assets.”

The Indenture will provide that upon any consolidation or merger or any sale, assignment,
transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or


-----

assets of the Company in accordance with the foregoing in which the Company is not the surviving
or continuing entity, as the case may be, the Surviving Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted
for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the Indenture and the Notes
with the same effect as if such Surviving Entity had been named as the “Company” therein, and
the Company shall be released from all of its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes;
provided that, in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
Company, the Company will not be released from its obligation to pay the principal of and
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes.

The Indenture will further provide that, if the Surviving Entity in any transaction described in,
and made in compliance with, this “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” section shall be
a Guarantor of the Notes, or if a Guarantor shall merge or consolidate with or into the Company or
the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, in any transaction described in, and made in compliance
with this “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” section, such Guarantor’s Guarantee of the
Notes will automatically terminate and be released and such Guarantor will automatically be
released from all of its obligations under its Guarantee of the Notes and all of its obligations as a
Guarantor under the Indenture contemporaneously with such transaction.

**_Reports to holders_**

The Indenture will provide that, whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC
and so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will mail or otherwise transmit to the
Holders of the outstanding Notes:

(1) all quarterly and annual financial information that would be required to be contained in
Items 7, 7A and 8 of Part II of a filing with the SEC on Form 10-K and Items 1, 2, and 3 of Part I
of a filing with the SEC on Form 10-Q, as applicable, if the Company were required to file
such forms pursuant to the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder and, with respect to the annual information only, a report on the Company’s annual
financial statements by the Company’s independent public accounting firm, in each case
within 15 days after the last day of the applicable time period for filing with the SEC (plus any
applicable extensions of such time period) specified in the relevant form or in the rules and
regulations of the SEC or any other applicable laws, rules or regulations; and

(2) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if the Company
were required to file such reports pursuant to the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder, in each case within three Business Days after the last day of
the applicable time period for filing with the SEC (plus any applicable extensions of such
time period) specified in Form 8-K or in the rules and regulations of the SEC or any other
applicable laws, rules or regulations; provided, however, that no such report will be required
to be furnished to the extent such report would be required by Items 1.04, 3.01, 3.02, 3.03,
5.02(e), 5.03, 5.04, 5.05, 5.06, 5.07 or 5.08 of Form 8-K;

provided, however, that, in the event that the Company is not subject to the reporting
requirements of Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, (i) the time periods for filing of the
foregoing information and reports (collectively, the “Financial Reports”) specified in the relevant
forms or rules and regulations of the SEC or any other applicable laws, rules or regulations as
described in clauses (1) and (2) above shall be those applicable to a non-accelerated filer or shall
otherwise be the longest available time period under such forms, rules and regulations of the SEC
or other applicable laws, rules or regulations, as the case may be, (plus any applicable extensions
of such time period), and (ii) the Financial Reports (A) will not be required to comply with
Section 302 or Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 and 308 of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K or Regulation G (with
respect to any non-GAAP financial measures contained therein) promulgated by the SEC, (B) will


-----

not be required to include information required by Item 601 of Regulation S-K promulgated by
the SEC, (C) will not be required to include financial statements for any acquired entity, businesses
or assets (whether acquired by merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets or Capital Stock or
otherwise) unless such acquisition has occurred and such financial statements would be required
by Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC to be included in an annual report on Form
10-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q or current report on Form 8-K of the Company, as the case
may be, provided that, notwithstanding that such Rule 3-05 or any other law, rule or regulation
would require that some or all of such financial statements be audited, the Company may
nonetheless deliver unaudited financial statements unless the Company shall have obtained such
audited financial statements in connection with such acquisition, and provided, further, that the
Company shall in no event be required to provide any financial statements as of dates or for
periods earlier or other than the dates or periods that would otherwise be required by such
Rule 3-05 for any such acquisition, and (D) will not be required to include the schedules identified
in Rule 5-04 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC. For purposes of clarity, it is understood
and agreed that (x) the Company may, in its sole discretion, include in any of the Financial Reports
information in addition to that specified in clauses (1) and (2) above and any information that it
would otherwise be entitled to omit pursuant to the provisions described above, and (y) no financial
statements shall be required for the acquisition or disposition of any entity, business or assets
(whether acquired or disposed of by merger, consolidation, acquisition or disposition of assets or
Capital Stock or otherwise) unless such acquisition or disposition, as the case may be, shall have
occurred.

In addition, the Indenture will provide that the Company and the Guarantors, if any, will agree to
make available to Holders of any outstanding Notes and to prospective purchasers designated
by such Holders, upon request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act so long as such Notes (other than Notes held by the Company or an
“affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Company) are not freely
transferable under the Securities Act.

The Indenture will provide that, if the Company is a Subsidiary of any direct or indirect parent
entity, the Financial Reports required pursuant to the first paragraph of this “Reports to Holders”
section may be those of such parent entity instead of the Company; provided that, if there are
material differences (as determined in good faith by the Company) between the consolidated
results of operations and financial condition of such parent entity and its consolidated Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and the consolidated or combined, as applicable, results of operations and
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, the quarterly and
annual Financial Reports required by the first paragraph above will include a presentation (which,
at the option of the Company, may be unaudited and may appear on the face of the financial
statements or in the notes thereto or elsewhere in the applicable Financial Reports) of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (it being understood
and agreed that such presentation may, at the option of the Company, take the form of a
condensed consolidating or combined, as applicable, statement of operations and a condensed
consolidating or combined, as applicable, balance sheet (in each case without notes thereto unless
the Company shall, in its sole discretion, elect to include notes), or a presentation similar to that
required by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X (as such rule was in effect on December 31, 2020)
promulgated by the SEC, or summarized financial information similar to that specified in
Rule 1-02(bb)(1) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC (without any notes thereto unless the
Company, in its sole discretion, shall elect to include notes, and which summarized financial
information may have such variations from the information specified in such Rule 1-02(bb)(1) as
the Company may in its sole discretion deem appropriate, including, without limitation, variations
to conform to the nature of its or its parent entity’s business and/or the line items and other


-----

information presented in its or its parent entity’s financial statements) for the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated or combined basis, as applicable, in each case for the applicable
periods).

Anything in the Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be deemed to
have satisfied its obligation to mail, transmit or otherwise furnish any Financial Report or other
information pursuant to the first paragraph and the immediately preceding paragraph of this
“—Reports to Holders” section by (a) filing or furnishing such Financial Report or other information
(or another document containing the information that would otherwise have been included in
such Financial Report or containing such other information, as applicable) with the SEC for public
availability or (b) posting such Financial Report or other information (or another document
containing the information that would otherwise have been included in such Financial Report or
containing such other information) on a website (which may be a password protected website)
hosted by the Company or by a third party, in each case within the applicable time period
specified above.

The Indenture will provide that, if any Financial Report or other information required by this
“—Reports to Holders” section (or any other document referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph) is not filed, mailed, posted, transmitted or otherwise furnished within the applicable
time period specified above and such Financial Report or other information (or other document)
is subsequently mailed, filed, posted, transmitted or otherwise furnished, the Company will be
deemed to have satisfied its obligations under this “—Reports to Holders” section with respect
to such Financial Report or other information (or other document), as the case may be, and any
Default or Event of Default with respect thereto or resulting therefrom shall be deemed to have
been cured and any acceleration of the Notes resulting therefrom shall be deemed to have been
rescinded so long as such rescission would not conflict with any applicable judgment or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction.

##### Events of default

The following events will be defined in the Indenture as “Events of Default” with respect to the
Notes:

(1) the failure to pay interest on any Notes when the same becomes due and payable and the
default continues for a period of 30 days;

(2) the failure to pay the principal of and premium, if any, on any Notes when such principal
becomes due and payable, at maturity or otherwise (including the failure to make a payment
to purchase Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to a Change of Control
Offer);

(3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply with any of its other covenants or
agreements contained in the Indenture (other than covenants or agreements a default in
whose performance would constitute an Event of Default under clause (1) or (2) above) and
such default continues for a period of 60 days after the Company receives written notice (with
a copy to the Trustee if given by Holders) specifying the default (and demanding that such
default be remedied) from the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% of the outstanding
principal amount of the Notes (except in the case of a default with respect to the “—Merger,
Consolidation and Sale of Assets” covenant, which will constitute an Event of Default when
the Company receives the written notice specified in this clause (3) (with a copy to the Trustee
if given by Holders) but without any requirement that such default continue for 60 days);


-----

(4) the failure to pay at final stated maturity (giving effect to any applicable grace periods and
any extensions thereof) the principal amount of any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other
than Non-Recourse Indebtedness) of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and
such payment shall not have been made, waived or extended within 30 days after such final
stated maturity (giving effect to any applicable grace periods and any extensions thereof)
(a “Payment Default”), or the acceleration of the final stated maturity of any Indebtedness
for borrowed money (other than Non-Recourse Indebtedness) of the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company and such acceleration shall not have been rescinded, annulled, waived or
otherwise cured within 30 days after receipt by the Company or such Subsidiary of the Company
of written notice of any such acceleration (an “Acceleration”), if the aggregate principal
amount of such Indebtedness, together with the aggregate principal amount of any other
Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Non-Recourse Indebtedness) of the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company as to which a Payment Default or an Acceleration shall have
occurred and shall be continuing, aggregates $190.0 million or more at any time;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy affecting the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries; or

(6) any Guarantee of the Notes by a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary of the Company
ceases (or the Guarantees of the Notes by a group of Guarantors that together would constitute
a Significant Subsidiary of the Company cease) to be in full force and effect for a period of
30 days, or a Guarantor of the Notes that is a Significant Subsidiary of the Company (or a group
of Guarantors of the Notes that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the
Company) denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guarantee (or their obligations under
their Guarantees, as the case may be) of the Notes unless such denial or disaffirmation, as
applicable, is rescinded, canceled or terminated within 30 days, in each case other than by
reason of the release, termination or discharge of any such Guarantees or Guarantors in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture or as a result of the discharge of the Indenture as
described below under “—Satisfaction and Discharge” or as a result of Legal Defeasance or
Covenant Defeasance as described below under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant
Defeasance.”

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (5) above with respect to
the Company) shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and accrued and
unpaid interest on all the outstanding Notes to be due and payable by notice in writing to the
Company and (if the notice is given by Holders) to the Trustee specifying the Event of Default and
that it is a “notice of acceleration,” and the same shall become immediately due and payable. If
an Event of Default specified in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is
continuing, then all unpaid principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the outstanding
Notes shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or
other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.

A notice of Default may not be given by the Trustee with respect to any action taken and reported
publicly or to Holders more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default,
notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default or acceleration
or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a
“Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder
delivered to the Company and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is
the Depositary or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners of
the Notes that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of
a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default (a “Default Direction”)
shall be deemed a continuing representation until the Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist
or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of


-----

providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other
information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the
accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request
therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is the Depositary or its
nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be
provided by the beneficial owner or owners, as the case may be, of interests in the applicable Global
Notes in lieu of the Depositary or its nominee and the Depositary shall be entitled to conclusively
rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the
Trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the
Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder
was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent
jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its
Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the
applicable Noteholder Direction, the running of the cure period with respect to each applicable
Default or Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the full original cure period with
respect to each such Default and Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any
remedy shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a
court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction,
but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the running of the
cure period with respect to each applicable Default or Event of Default shall be automatically
stayed and the full original cure period with respect to each such Default and Event of Default that
resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any
remedy shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any
breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder
Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of
Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been
insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be
void ab initio, with the effect that each applicable Default or Event of Default shall be deemed
never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received
such Noteholder Direction or any notice of any such Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder
Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default described in
clause (5) of the first paragraph under this caption “—Events of default” shall not require
compliance with the preceding two paragraphs.

The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in
accordance with the Indenture that is accompanied by the required Position Representations, and
shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation,
enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officers’ Certificate
delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to
Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or
otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Company, any holder or any other Person in
acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction that is accompanied by the required Position
Representations or on an Officers’ Certificate from the Company, in either case, pursuant to which
the Trustee refrains from taking any action or stays any remedy in good faith with respect
thereto or in reliance thereon.


-----

The Indenture will provide that, at any time after an acceleration with respect to Notes as
described in the second paragraph under this caption “—Events of default”, the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind and cancel such acceleration
and its consequences:

(1) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction;

(2) if all existing Events of Default, other than nonpayment of principal of or interest on the
Notes that have become due solely because of the acceleration, have been cured or waived;

(3) if, to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of
interest and overdue principal, in each case which have become due otherwise than by such
acceleration, at a per annum rate equal to the interest rate per annum borne by the Notes, has
been paid; and

(4) if the Company has paid the Trustee its reasonable compensation and reimbursed the Trustee
for its reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of
Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph under this caption “—Events of Default” has
occurred and is continuing, the acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically rescinded and
cancelled if (a) within 60 days after such acceleration of the Notes as a result of such Event of
Default, the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than NonRecourse Indebtedness) of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as to which a Payment
Default or an Acceleration shall have occurred and shall be continuing shall be less than
$190.0 million, whether as a result of any such Payment Default or Payment Defaults or
Acceleration or Accelerations, as the case may be, having been remedied or cured or waived by
the holders of the relevant Indebtedness, the relevant Indebtedness having been repaid, redeemed,
defeased or otherwise discharged, or otherwise, (b) the rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (c) all existing Events of Default, other
than nonpayment of the principal of or interest on the Notes that shall have become due solely
because of the acceleration, have been cured or waived.

No rescission of acceleration of the Notes pursuant to the provisions described in the two
immediately preceding paragraphs shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right
consequent thereto.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may waive, by their
consent (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes), any Default or Event of Default and its consequences,
except a continuing default in the payment of the principal, premium, if any, or interest on any
Notes held by any non-consenting Holder (excluding a default in payment resulting from an
acceleration that has been or is being waived or rescinded or that has been cured).

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes or any Guarantees of the Notes
except as provided in the Indenture and the TIA. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture
relating to the duties of the Trustee if a default occurs, the Trustee is under no obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request, order or direction of any
of the Holders of the Notes, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee. Subject to all provisions of the Indenture and
applicable law, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee under
the Indenture.


-----

Under the Indenture, the Company is required to provide an Officers’ Certificate to the Trustee
promptly upon any Senior Officer of the Company obtaining knowledge of any Default or Event
of Default, and is also required to provide an annual Officers’ Certificate indicating whether or not
the officers signing such certificate know of any Default or Event of Default under the Indenture
and, if applicable, describing such Default or Event of Default and the status thereof.

##### Legal defeasance and covenant defeasance

The Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and the obligations
of all Guarantors, if any, discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes (“Legal Defeasance”).
Such Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the
entire indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes, the Guarantors, if any, shall be
released from all of their obligations under the Indenture and their Guarantees of the Notes, and
the Company shall be released from all of its other obligations under the Indenture and the
Notes, except that the following provisions of the Indenture shall survive:

(1) the rights of Holders to receive, solely from the trust fund described below, payments in
respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes when such payments
are due;

(2) the Company’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payments on the Notes;

(3) the rights, powers, trust, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the Company’s obligations
in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the
Company and the Guarantors, if any, under the Indenture released with respect to, among other
things, the covenants described above under the captions “—Possible Future Guarantees,”
“—Change of Control,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional
Indebtedness,” “—Certain Covenants—Maintenance of Total Unencumbered Assets,” “—Certain
Covenants—Reports to Holders” and clauses (2) and (4) of the first paragraph under “—Certain
Covenants—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter
any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default. In
the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, (x) the Events of Default described in clauses (1) and
(2) (solely insofar as such clauses relate to any failure to pay amounts due in connection with a
Change of Control Offer), clause (3) (solely insofar as it relates to the covenants and agreements
as to which Covenant Defeasance has occurred), clause (4), clause (5) (except with respect to
Company) and clause (6) of the first paragraph under “—Events of Default” will no longer
constitute Events of Default and (y) Guarantors, if any, of the Notes shall be automatically released
from all of their obligations under their Guarantees of the Notes and the Indenture and such
Guarantees will be automatically released, terminated and discharged.

In order to effect either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the
Holders of the Notes cash in U.S. dollars in such amount as will be sufficient, U.S. Government
Obligations the scheduled payments of principal of and interest on which will be sufficient
(without any reinvestment of such interest), or a combination thereof in such amounts as will
be sufficient, as confirmed, certified or attested by an Independent Financial Advisor in
writing to the Trustee, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on
the stated maturity date thereof or any earlier Redemption Date;


-----

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion
of counsel in the United States (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions, exceptions and limitations) confirming that:

(a) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue
Service a ruling; or

(b) since the date of the Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal
income tax law;

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel shall confirm that,
the Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal
Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
opinion of counsel in the United States (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions, exceptions and limitations) confirming that the Holders of the Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had
not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such
deposit (other than a Default and Event of Default resulting from borrowing of funds to be
applied to make such deposit and any similar or substantially contemporaneous transactions
and, in each case, the granting of any Liens in connection therewith);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, any agreement or instrument that, in the judgment of the Company,
is material with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (excluding the
Indenture) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is bound;

(6) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an opinion of
counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions, exceptions and
limitations), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture to such
Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;
and

(7) the Company shall have delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of the Notes on the stated maturity date thereof or on the
applicable Redemption Date, as the case may be (which instructions may be contained in the
Officer’s Certificate referred to in clause (6) above).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the opinion of counsel required by clause (2) above with respect
to a Legal Defeasance need not be delivered if all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation (1) have become due and payable or (2) will become due and payable on their
maturity date or any earlier Redemption Date within one year and, in the case of any such
redemption, under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company.

##### Satisfaction and discharge

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving
rights of registration of transfer or exchange of the Notes as expressly provided for in the Indenture


-----

and except for the Trustee’s right to reimbursement of fees and expenses and indemnification as
expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes, and all of the Guarantees, if
any, of the Notes shall be discharged, terminated and released, when:

(1) either

(a) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes
that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been
deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid
to the Company or discharged from such trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation; or

(b) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and
payable by giving of a notice of redemption, upon stated maturity or otherwise, will become
due and payable within one year (upon stated maturity or otherwise), or are to be called
for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the
giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the
Company, and the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the
Trustee cash in such amount as will be sufficient, U.S. Government Obligations the
scheduled payments of principal of and interest on which will be sufficient (without any
reinvestment of such interest), or a combination thereof in such amounts as will be
sufficient, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on such Notes not theretofore
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
such Notes to the date of maturity or redemption, as the case may be, together with
irrevocable instructions from the Company directing the Trustee to apply such funds to
the payment thereof at maturity or redemption;

(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by the Company under the
Indenture; and

(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an opinion of counsel
(which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions, exceptions and limitations)
stating that all conditions precedent under the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture have been complied with.

##### Modification of the notes, any guarantees or the indenture

From time to time, the Company, the Guarantors (if any) of the Notes and the Trustee, without
the consent of the Holders of the Notes, may modify, amend or supplement the Notes, any
Guarantees or other guarantees of the Notes or the Indenture:

pursuant to the Indenture;

(11)to provide for the issuance and delivery of Additional Notes; and

in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or a tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes), and
compliance with any provision of the Notes, any Guarantees or other guarantees thereof or the
Indenture may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal

Change of Control Triggering Event.

The consent of the Holders of the Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the

waiver.

by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

##### The Trustee

The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Trustee will perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Indenture. During the
existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such rights and powers vested in it by
the Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent man would
exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

The Indenture and the provisions of the TIA contain certain limitations on the rights of the
Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Company, to obtain payments of claims in certain
cases or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise.

Company; provided that if the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest as described in the TIA, it
must eliminate such conflict or resign.

Four Quarter Period. In addition to and without limitation of the foregoing, for purposes of this
definition, “Consolidated EBITDA” and “Consolidated Fixed Charges” shall be calculated after
giving effect on a pro forma basis for the period of such calculation to the following (without
duplication):

(1) the incurrence of the Indebtedness, if any, by such Person or any of its Subsidiaries giving rise
to the need to calculate the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and (x) any
repayment, repurchase, defeasance, redemption or other discharge (collectively, for purposes
of this definition, “repayment”; the terms “repay” and “repaid” shall have correlative
meanings for purposes of this definition) of any Indebtedness with the proceeds of the

Indebtedness is to be incurred or the transactions giving rise to the need to calculate the
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as the case may be, and (y) any purchase or other
acquisition or origination of any Investments, Persons or other securities or assets made or to be
made by such Person or any of its Subsidiaries (in one transaction or a series of related
transactions and including, without limitation, by merger, consolidation, acquisition of Capital
Stock or otherwise) with the proceeds of the Indebtedness to be incurred or in connection
with the transactions pursuant to which such Indebtedness is to be incurred or the transactions
giving rise to the need to calculate the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as the
case may be (including, without limitation, any Consolidated EBITDA attributable to the
Investments, Persons or other securities or assets which are being purchased, acquired or
originated as aforesaid), in each case as if such incurrence, repayment, purchase, acquisition or
origination, as the case may be, had occurred on the first day of the Four Quarter Period;

(2) the incurrence and repayment of any Indebtedness of such Person or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the incurrence or repayment of any Indebtedness which is covered by clause
(1) above), including any repayment of any Indebtedness with the proceeds from the incurrence
of Indebtedness covered by this clause (2) or in connection with the related transaction
referred to in clause (3) of this definition, in each case that occurred during the Four Quarter
Period or at any time subsequent to the last day of the Four Quarter Period and on or prior to
the Determination Date, as if such incurrence or repayment had occurred on the first day of
the Four Quarter Period, but only to the extent the incurrence or repayment of such
Indebtedness was made in connection with a transaction or series of related transactions
described in clause (3) below that meets the significance test set forth in such clause (3);
provided, however, that such calculation shall not give pro forma effect to the incurrence of
any Indebtedness described in this clause (2) if such Indebtedness is not outstanding as of the
Determination Date; and

(3) any sale or other disposition or any purchase or other acquisition or origination of any
Investments, Persons or other securities or assets (other than any purchase, acquisition or
origination covered by clause (1) above) made by such Person or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, without limitation, by merger, consolidation, acquisition of Capital Stock or
otherwise) in one transaction or a series of related transactions during the Four Quarter Period
or at any time subsequent to the last day of the Four Quarter Period and on or prior to the
Determination Date (including, without limitation, any Consolidated EBITDA attributable to
the Investments, Persons or other securities or assets which were sold, disposed of, purchased,
acquired or originated as aforesaid), in each case as if such sale, disposition, purchase,
acquisition or origination had occurred on the first day of the Four Quarter Period, but,
anything in this clause (3) to the contrary notwithstanding, only if the Investments, Persons or
other securities or assets sold, disposed of, purchased, acquired or originated in such
transaction or such series of related transactions, as the case may be, met, at the time of such
transaction or series of related transactions (or, at the option of the Company, would have


-----

met, as of the last day of the Four Quarter Period), the conditions specified in clause (1)(ii) or
1(iii) of Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC (as such Rule is in effect on
June 1, 2021 but substituting 20% for 10% each place 10% appears in such Rule and assuming
that the Company was the “registrant” and that the Investments, Persons or other securities or
assets sold, disposed of, purchased, acquired or originated in such transaction or series of
related transactions constituted a “subsidiary” of the Company within the meaning of such
Rule), with the calculation of whether any such conditions are met to be made in accordance
with GAAP.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and if pro forma effect is being given to the
incurrence of such Indebtedness, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be calculated as if
the rate in effect on the Determination Date had been the applicable rate for that portion of
the Four Quarter Period during which such Indebtedness was not outstanding (taking into account
any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness if such Interest Rate Agreement
has a remaining term in excess of 12 months). If any Indebtedness bears an interest rate chosen at
the option of the Company and if pro forma effect is being given to the incurrence of such
Indebtedness, the interest rate shall be calculated by applying such optional rate chosen by the
Company for that portion of the Four Quarter Period during which such Indebtedness was not
outstanding. For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any
calculation under this definition, the pro forma calculations will be determined in good faith by
the Company and such pro forma calculations may include, for the avoidance of doubt and at the
Company’s sole discretion, cost savings and expense reductions relating to any transaction
which is being given pro forma effect (x) that have been or are expected to be realized within
12 months after the date of such transaction and/or (y) that are determined in accordance with
Regulation S-X (as in effect on December 31, 2020) under the Securities Act.

In making any pro forma calculation, the amount of Indebtedness under any revolving credit
facility outstanding on the applicable Determination Date (other than any Indebtedness being
incurred under such facility in connection with a transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) will be deemed to be:

(i) the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable Four Quarter Period or
such shorter period for which such facility was outstanding, or

(ii) if such facility was created after the end of such Four Quarter Period, the average daily
balance of such Indebtedness during the period from the date of creation of such facility to
such Determination Date.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that any Indebtedness (or any
portion thereof) is incurred pursuant to, or any other transaction (including, without limitation,
any merger, consolidation, or acquisition or disposition of Capital Stock, Investments or other assets
or property) must comply with or is undertaken or consummated in reliance on, a covenant,
basket, exception, test or other provision in the Indenture requiring compliance with a ratio or a
test or limitation determined on the basis of a ratio (including, without limitation, the Consolidated
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio), such ratio shall be calculated without giving effect to any
substantially contemporaneous incurrence of any other Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness
incurred pursuant to clause (11) of the definition of Permitted Indebtedness).

“Consolidated Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum, without

-----

of the Notes) of such Person (in each case other than dividends paid or payable in Capital

bankers’ acceptances and other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness
that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not

deemed to be the incurrence of Indebtedness; (b) unless otherwise expressly provided in the

anything in the Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, Indebtedness of variable interest
entities (within the meaning of GAAP) shall not be deemed Indebtedness of any Person or any of
its Subsidiaries. For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated
restriction (including, without limitation, those set forth in any definition) on the amount or
incurrence of any Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent amount of Indebtedness denominated


-----

in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect
on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed,
in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to
Refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such Refinancing would
cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such Refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated
restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount (or, if
incurred with original issue discount, the issue price) of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the principal amount (or if incurred with original issue discount, the accreted value) of
such Indebtedness being Refinanced plus any additional Indebtedness incurred to pay interest or
dividends thereon plus the amount of any premium (including tender premiums), defeasance costs
and any fees and expenses incurred in connection with the incurrence of such Refinancing
Indebtedness; and provided, further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the
“—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness” covenant, the “—Maintenance of Total
Unencumbered Assets” covenant, the definition of “Permitted Indebtedness” or elsewhere in the
Indenture, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company and its Subsidiaries may
incur pursuant to such “—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness” covenant and such
definition shall not be deemed to be exceeded, nor shall the Company be deemed to have
breached its obligations under such “—Maintenance of Total Unencumbered Assets” covenant,
solely as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Subject to the foregoing, the principal
amount of any Indebtedness incurred to Refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different
currency from the Indebtedness being Refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness and
Indebtedness being Refinanced are denominated that is in effect on the date of such Refinancing.
Unsecured Indebtedness shall not be treated as subordinated or junior to secured Indebtedness
merely because such Indebtedness is unsecured. In calculating the U.S. dollar-equivalent amount of
Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, the Company may, at its option, take into
account any Currency Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness. For purposes of clarity, it is
understood and agreed that, anything in the Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the term
“Indebtedness” shall not include any commitment to make loans, advances or other Investments,
or to purchase Investments, Persons or other securities or assets.

such Standard Recourse Undertakings shall (solely for purposes of such clause (4)) not be
considered Non-Recourse Indebtedness to the extent, and only to the extent, that such claim

money of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and is also a liability (for GAAP
purposes) of the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable (excluding any such Subsidiary that

the foregoing clauses (1) through (4) in the ordinary course of business.

For the purposes of clarity, it is understood and agreed that, solely for purposes of clause (4) of
the first paragraph under the caption “—Events of Default,” if the payment of any Indebtedness
for borrowed money of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would otherwise constitute NonRecourse Indebtedness is guaranteed in part but not in whole by the Company or a Subsidiary of
the Company in such manner that the portion of such Indebtedness so guaranteed no longer
constitutes Non-Recourse Indebtedness, then (solely for the purposes of such clause (4)) the

Indebtedness with substantially the same terms, and the accrual, accumulation or payment of
dividends on Disqualified Capital Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class or

issuance of Disqualified Capital Stock for purposes of the “—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional
Indebtedness” or the “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” covenants or the foregoing
provisions of the definition of “Permitted Indebtedness.”

and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (any such entire or partial
amount of Indebtedness until the Company’s election under this paragraph is revoked, the
“Reserved Debt Amount”) will, at the Company’s option, either (a) be determined on the date of
such entry into, or increase in commitments under, such revolving credit facility (assuming that
the Reserved Debt Amount has been borrowed as of such date) or the date of entry into such
commitment to incur Indebtedness (assuming that the Reserved Debt Amount has been borrowed
as of such date) and, if any ratio, test or other provision of the Indenture is satisfied with respect
thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of
letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under the Indenture
irrespective of such ratio, test or other provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or
reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) or

time.

applicable law or regulation) is owned by such Person and/or one or more Wholly Owned
Subsidiaries of such Person.

The Indenture will provide that references to a “revolving credit facility” and similar references
shall be deemed to include, without limitation, any Repurchase Agreement which provides for
successive sales and repurchases of securities or other assets or is otherwise intended to provide
financing on a revolving basis, and references to “revolving credit Indebtedness” and similar
references shall be deemed to include, without limitation, Indebtedness under any such Repurchase
Agreement, in each case unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires. The
Company shall determine in good faith whether or not a Repurchase Agreement constitutes a
revolving credit facility.

The Indenture will provide that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the
Indenture, when calculating the availability under any basket or financial ratio under the Indenture
in connection with an Acquisition (including for purposes of the “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Additional Indebtedness” and the “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” covenants, the
definition of “Permitted Indebtedness” (including the related definition of “Total Assets”), the
definition of “Issue Date Committed Amount” and the definition of “Refinancing Indebtedness”),
the date of calculation or determination of such basket or ratio and whether such action or
transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied
(including as to the absence of any Default or Event of Default)) shall, at the option of the Company,
be the date the definitive agreement for such Acquisition is entered into (any such date, the
“Acquisition Test Date”) and such baskets or ratios (and whether any related requirements or
conditions are complied with) shall be calculated or determined on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to such Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith
(including the application of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred on the Acquisition Test Date and
if after giving effect to such Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in
connection therewith (including the application of proceeds thereof) the Company and its
Subsidiaries would have been able to undertake such actions and transactions on the Acquisition
Test Date in compliance with such basket or ratio (including any related requirements or conditions),
such basket or ratio (including any related requirements or conditions) will be deemed complied
with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that if financial statements prepared on a consolidated
basis in accordance with GAAP for a more recently ended fiscal quarter become available, the
Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate or redetermine all such baskets or ratios
(including any related requirements or conditions) on the basis of such financial statements, in
which case, such date of recalculation or redetermination will thereafter be deemed to be the
applicable Acquisition Test Date for purposes of such baskets or ratios (including any related
requirements or conditions). For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are
exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in
Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets of the Company or the target company (with Total Assets of


-----

the target company determined as though references to the “Company” in the definition of
“Total Assets” and the definition of terms related thereto were references to the target company,
mutatis mutandis) subsequent to such Acquisition Test Date and at or prior to the consummation
of the relevant Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as
a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Acquisition and the
related transactions are permitted under the Indenture and (y) such baskets or ratios (including any
related requirements or conditions) shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such
Acquisition or related transactions; provided that if the Company elects to have such determinations
occur at the Acquisition Test Date, any such transactions and actions shall be deemed to have
occurred on the Acquisition Test Date and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any
baskets or ratios under the Indenture in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to
such Acquisition after the Acquisition Test Date and before the consummation of such Acquisition
unless and until such Acquisition has been terminated or abandoned, as determined by the
Company, prior to the consummation thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may
at any time withdraw any election made under this paragraph.

The Indenture will provide that (a) references to sections of, or rules or regulations under, the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the TIA shall be deemed to include substitute, replacement or
successor sections, rules or regulations, as the case may be, promulgated by the SEC from time
to time and (b) references to accounting standards, codifications or pronouncements shall be
deemed to include any substitute, replacement or successor accounting standards, codifications or
pronouncements promulgated by the FASB or any other recognized accounting authority in the
United States of America, except, in each case, (1) as otherwise set forth in the “—Reports to
holders” covenant, the definitions of Change of Control, Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, GAAP and Significant Subsidiary or any other provision of the Indenture which expressly
provides that a law, rule or regulation, or any accounting standard, codification or pronouncement,
shall be the law, rule, regulation, standard, codification or pronouncement, as applicable, as in
effect on the Issue Date or other specified date and except as the context otherwise requires or
(2) as otherwise determined by the Company pursuant to the last sentence of the definition of
GAAP or any other provision of the Indenture that permits the Company to determine whether
to give effect to any such substitute, replacement or successor sections, rules, regulations or
accounting standards, codifications or pronouncements or any Accounting Changes or other
changes in GAAP.

### Book-entry, delivery and form

Except as set forth below, the Notes will be issued in registered, global form without interest
coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
Notes offered and sold to QIBs (“Rule 144A Notes”) will initially be represented by one or more
Notes in registered, global form without interest coupons (“Rule 144A Global Notes”). Notes offered
and sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S Notes”) will initially
be represented by one or more Notes in registered, global form without interest coupons
(“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, “Global Notes”).
The Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with the Trustee, as custodian for DTC and
registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to the accounts of direct
participants in DTC as described below. Through and including the 40th day after the later of the
commencement of this offering and the closing of this offering (such period through and
including such 40th day, the “Restricted Period”) beneficial interests in Regulation S Global Notes
may be held only through Clearstream and Euroclear (as participants in DTC), and may not be
offered or sold in the United States (within the meaning of Regulation S) or to or for the account
or benefit of a U.S. person (within the meaning of Regulation S), except to a person that takes
delivery through a Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements
described below or otherwise in accordance with Regulation S. Beneficial interests in Rule 144A
Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes at any
time except in the circumstances described below. See “—Exchanges Between Regulation S
Notes and Rule 144A Notes.” Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in
whole and not in part, only to DTC, or another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its
nominee. Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the
Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Certificated Notes (as defined
below). See “—Exchange of Book-Entry Notes for Certificated Notes.” Rule 144A Notes and
Regulation S Notes (including beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes and Regulation S
Global Notes) will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and will bear the applicable
restrictive legend set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of beneficial
interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its
direct or indirect participants (including, if applicable, those of Clearstream and Euroclear),
which may change from time to time.

Initially, the Trustee will act as paying agent and registrar for the Notes. The Notes may be
presented for registration of transfer and exchange at the offices of the registrar.

##### Certain procedures

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream
are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within
the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them from time
to time. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to
contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its
participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and
settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry
changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s
system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that
clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly
(collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own
securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through Participants or Indirect Participants.


-----

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it, ownership of interests in
the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership thereof will be effected only
through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the
Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interest in the Global Notes).

Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes may hold their interests therein directly through DTC, if
they are Participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and
Clearstream) which are Participants or Indirect Participants in such system. Investors in the
Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or
Clearstream, if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations that are
participants in such system. After the expiration of the Restricted Period (but not earlier), investors
may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system
other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Each of Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of its participants through customers’ securities accounts in
its name on the books of its depositary. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through
Euroclear or Clearstream, will be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those
interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream will also be subject to the procedures and
requirements of such system. The laws of some states require, and the laws of other jurisdictions
may require, that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they
own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons
will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act
on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global
Note to pledge such interests to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical
certificate evidencing such interests.

Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have Notes registered
in their names, will not receive physical delivery of Certificated Notes and will not be considered
the registered owners or “holders” thereof under the Indenture for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered
in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC or its nominee in its capacity as the
registered holder under the Indenture. Under the terms of the Indenture, we and the Trustee will
treat the persons in whose names the Notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the
owners thereof for the purpose of receiving such payments and for any and all other purposes
whatsoever. Consequently, neither we, the Trustee nor any of our or the Trustee’s agents has or
will have any responsibility or liability for (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or
Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership
interest in any Global Notes, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or
any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in
any Global Notes or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of
its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt
of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to
credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date, in amounts
proportionate to their respective holdings in the principal amount of the relevant security as
shown on the records of DTC. Payments by Participants and Indirect Participants to the beneficial
owners of Global Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and
will be the responsibility of Participants or Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility
of DTC, the Trustee or us. Neither we nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of
its Participants or Indirect Participants in identifying or remitting payments to the beneficial
owners of the Notes, and we and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in
relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.


-----

Except for trades involving only Euroclear and Clearstream participants, interests in the Global
Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System and
secondary market trading activity in such interests will, therefore, settle in immediately available
funds, subject in all cases to the rules and procedures of DTC and its Participants. See “—SameDay Settlement and Payment.” Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer
Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s
procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear
and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules
and operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described under
“Transfer Restrictions,” crossmarket transfers between Participants in DTC, on the one hand, and
Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in
accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream by their respective depositaries;
however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or
Clearstream by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and
within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream will, if the
transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to
take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant
Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for
same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream participants may not
deliver instructions directly to the respective depositaries for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only at
the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the
Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Global
Notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if
an Event of Default (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) with respect to the Notes has
occurred and is continuing, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Certificated
Notes (which will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless
we determine otherwise), and to distribute such Certificated Notes to its Participants.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform the
foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes and in the
Rule 144A Global Notes among their respective participants, and such procedures may be
discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee nor any of our or their respective agents
will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

##### Exchange of book-entry notes for certificated notes

A Global Note will be exchangeable for Notes in registered certificated form without coupons
(“Certificated Notes”) if (1) DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary
for the Global Notes or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act (if
such registration is required by applicable law) and we do not appoint a successor depositary for
the Notes within 90 days after we receive such notification or we become aware that DTC has
ceased to be so registered, as the case may be, (2) we, at our option and subject to DTC
procedures, notify the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of Certificated Notes
or (3) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default. In all cases, Certificated
Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests therein will be registered
in the names, and issued in any authorized denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC (in


-----

accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred
to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless we determine otherwise.

##### Exchanges between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes

Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note
may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Note only if such exchange
occurs in connection with a transfer of beneficial interests in such Regulation S Global Note
pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that the Notes are being transferred to a person who
the transferor reasonably believes to be a QIB, purchasing for its own account or the account of
a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and in accordance with all applicable
securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions. Beneficial interests in a
Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest
in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Restricted Period,
only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of
Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) and, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of such
Restricted Period, that the interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through
Euroclear or Clearstream.

Transfers involving an exchange of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note for a
beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa will be effected in DTC by means of an
instruction originated by the Trustee under the Indenture through the DTC Deposit/ Withdraw
at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments
will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a
corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa, as
applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an
interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly,
will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial
interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and
practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note
prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period.

##### Same-day settlement and payment

Payments in respect of the Notes represented by Global Notes (including principal and interest)
will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to DTC or its nominee, as the registered
holder of the Global Notes. In the event that Certificated Notes are issued under the limited
circumstances described above, we will pay the principal and premium, if any, on, and may pay
interest on, the Certificated Notes at the office or agency maintained by us for such purpose in the
United States of America, which initially shall be an office of the Trustee, upon surrender of such
Certificated Note at such office or agency. Interest on any Certificated Notes may also be paid, at
our option, by check mailed to the addresses of the registered holders entitled thereto or by
wire transfer to accounts in the United States of America specified by such holders. The Notes
represented by Global Notes are expected to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System,
and any permitted secondary market trading activity in the Notes will, therefore, be required by
DTC to be settled in immediately available funds.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant in DTC will be credited, and any such
crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities


-----

settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear or Clearstream) immediately
following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of
sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a
Participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available
in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear
or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.


-----

### Material United States federal income tax considerations

The following summarizes certain material United States federal income tax consequences
expected to result from the purchase at the issue price (the first price at which a substantial amount
of Notes is sold to purchasers other than bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations
acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers), ownership and
disposition of Notes by holders acquiring Notes at original issue for cash pursuant to this offering.

This discussion is based on:

- the Code;

- current, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code;

- the legislative history of the Code;

- current administrative interpretations and practices of the IRS; and

- court decisions;

all as of the date of this offering memorandum. In addition, the administrative interpretations
and practices of the IRS include its practices and policies as expressed in private letter rulings that
are not binding on the IRS, except with respect to the particular taxpayers who requested and
received those rulings. Future legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and
practices and/or court decisions may adversely affect the tax considerations contained in this
discussion. Any change could apply retroactively to transactions preceding the date of the change.
The tax considerations contained in this discussion may be challenged by the IRS, and we have
not requested, and do not plan to request, any rulings from the IRS concerning the Notes.

The tax treatment of a holder of the Notes may vary depending upon a holder’s particular situation.
Certain holders (including, but not limited to, certain financial institutions, insurance companies,
broker-dealers, persons who mark-to-market the Notes, an accrual method taxpayer subject to
special tax accounting rules as a result of its use of financial statements, tax-exempt organizations,
regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, U.S. Holders (as defined below)
whose functional currency for tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar, expatriates and persons holding
Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge” or “conversion transaction”) may be subject to special rules
not discussed below. This discussion is limited to holders who will hold the Notes as “capital
assets” (generally, property held for investment) within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code.

##### You should consult your tax advisor as to the particular tax consequences of your purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes.

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is for United
States federal income tax purposes (1) a citizen or resident of the United States, (2) a corporation,
including for this purpose an entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income
tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political
subdivision thereof, (3) an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax
regardless of its source, or (4) a trust, if both (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise
primary supervision over the administration of the trust and (b) one or more United States
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, to the extent provided in Treasury regulations, certain trusts that are beneficial
holders of the Notes and in existence on August 20, 1996, and treated as United States persons
prior to such date, that elect to continue to be treated as United States persons also will be U.S.
Holders. As used herein, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner (other than an
entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) of
Notes that is not a U.S. Holder.


-----

If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for
United States federal income tax purposes) holds Notes, the treatment of a partner in the
partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and activities of the partnership. A
holder that is a partnership and partners in such partnership should consult their tax advisors
regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing
of the Notes.

##### Characterization of the notes held by REITs

Debt instruments of “publicly offered REITs” constitute “real estate assets” within the meaning
of Section 856(c)(5)(B) of the Code. We are, and expect we will continue to be, a “publicly offered
REIT.” Therefore, for so long as we continue to be a “publicly offered REIT,” Notes held by a
REIT will constitute “real estate assets” within the meaning of Section 856(c)(5)(B) of the Code.
However, in order for a REIT to retain its qualification as a REIT, at the close of each quarter of its
taxable year, not more than 25% of the value of the total assets of such REIT may be represented
by debt instruments of “publicly offered REITs” that are not secured by real property.

##### U.S. holders

**_Interest_**

Stated interest on the Notes will be included in the income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at
the time such interest is received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s regular method
of tax accounting.

**_Original issue discount_**

The Notes will be issued at a price that comes within the de minimis exception to the original
issue discount (“OID”) provisions of the Code, and, accordingly, U.S. Holders will not be subject to
the OID provisions with respect to the Notes.

**_Sale, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition_**

In general, a U.S. Holder of the Notes will recognize gain or loss upon the sale, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of such Notes in an amount equal to the difference
between (1) the amount of cash (including any “make-whole” premium in the event of a
redemption requiring its payment) and the fair market value of property received in exchange
therefor (except to the extent attributable to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, as
described below) and (2) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Notes. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis
in the Notes generally will be equal to the price paid for such Notes. The portion of any proceeds
that is attributable to accrued and unpaid interest will not be taken into account in computing
the U.S. Holder’s capital gain or loss, but will instead be treated as interest income to the extent not
previously included in income, as described under “—Interest” above.

Capital gain recognized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder from the sale of a capital asset that has
been held for more than 12 months is currently subject to United States federal income tax at
reduced rates. Capital gain from the sale of an asset held for 12 months or less will be subject to
United States federal income tax at ordinary income tax rates. In addition, capital gain recognized
by a corporate taxpayer will continue to be subject to United States federal income tax at the
ordinary income tax rates applicable to corporations. The ability to deduct capital losses is
subject to limitations under the Code.

**_Additional tax on investment income_**

A U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate or trust that does not fall into a special class of trusts
that is exempt from such tax is subject to a 3.8% tax on the lesser of (1) the U.S. Holder’s “net


-----

investment income” for the relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S. Holder’s modified
adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold. A U.S. Holder’s net
investment income will generally include its interest income on the Notes and net gain from the
disposition of the Notes, unless such interest income and net gain is derived in the ordinary course
of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of certain
passive or trading activities). Net investment income may, however, be reduced by properly
allocable deductions to such income. U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts are urged
to consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability of this 3.8% Medicare tax to their income
and gains from the Notes.

##### Non-U.S. holders

**_Interest_**

A Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal income or withholding
tax on payments of interest on the Notes, unless that Non-U.S. Holder actually or constructively
owns 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock that are entitled
to vote within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3) of the Code, is a controlled foreign corporation
related to us or is a bank receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, and
provided that such interest is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in
the United States by the Non-U.S. Holder. To qualify for the exemption from taxation, the last
United States payor, as defined in the Treasury regulations (or a non-U.S. payor who is a qualified
intermediary or withholding foreign partnership) in the chain of payment prior to payment to a
Non-U.S. Holder (the “Withholding Agent”), must have received, before payment, a statement that
(1) is signed by the beneficial owner of the Notes under penalties of perjury, (2) certifies that
such owner is not a U.S. Holder and (3) provides the name and address of the beneficial owner.
The statement may be made on an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E or a substantially similar
form. An IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E is generally effective for the year of signature
plus the following three calendar years; however, the beneficial owner must inform the
Withholding Agent of any change in the information on the statement within 30 days of such
change. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E may
in certain circumstances remain effective until a change in circumstances makes any information
on such form inaccurate. If the Notes are held through a securities clearing organization or certain
other financial institution, the beneficial owner must provide to such organization or institution
an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E and the organization or institution must provide a
certificate stating that such organization or institution has been provided with a valid IRS Form
W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E to the Withholding Agent.

A Non-U.S. Holder that does not qualify for exemption from withholding as described in the
preceding paragraph generally will be subject to withholding of United States federal income tax
at a tax rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) on payments of interest on the Notes.

**_Sale, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition_**

A Non-U.S. Holder will generally not be subject to United States federal income or withholding
tax on any amount which constitutes gain upon the sale, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of the Notes, provided (1) the gain is not effectively connected with the conduct of a
trade or business in the United States by the Non-U.S. Holder and (2) in the case of an individual
Non-U.S. Holder, such holder is not present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year. Certain other exceptions may be applicable and a Non-U.S. Holder should consult its
tax advisor in this regard.

If a Non-U.S. Holder is an individual that is present in the United States for 183 days or more in a
taxable year and certain other conditions are met, such holder will generally be subject to a flat


-----

30% tax (subject to reductions under an applicable income tax treaty if the Non-U.S. Holder is
eligible for the benefits of such treaty) on the gain derived from the sale, redemption or other
taxable disposition in such taxable year, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses, even
though such holder is not considered a resident of the United States. The portion of any proceeds
that is attributable to accrued and unpaid interest will not be taken into account in computing
the Non-U.S. Holder’s capital gain or loss, but will instead be treated as interest income, as described
under “—Interest” above.

To the extent that gain or interest income with respect to the Notes is not exempt from the
United States federal income or withholding tax, a Non-U.S. Holder may be able to reduce or
eliminate such tax under an applicable income tax treaty.

**_Conduct of a United States trade or business_**

A Non-U.S. Holder whose gain or interest income with respect to the Notes is effectively connected
with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by such Non-U.S. Holder (and if
certain tax treaties apply, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S.
Holder in the United States) will not be subject to the United States federal withholding tax if
such Non U.S. Holder provides an IRS Form W-8ECI to the Withholding Agent. Instead, such
Non-U.S. Holder will generally be subject to tax on such gain and interest income at regular income
tax rates in the manner similar to the taxation of U.S. Holders. In addition, a corporate Non-U.S.
Holder will be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% of its “dividend equivalent amount”
(generally representing the amount that remains after paying the tax on such gain or interest
income discussed in the preceding sentence), although a Non-U.S. Holder may be able to reduce
or eliminate such tax under an applicable income tax treaty.

##### Information reporting and backup withholding

Generally, we must report annually to the IRS and to U.S. and Non-U.S. Holders the amount of
interest paid to such holders and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments.
Copies of the information returns reporting such interest and withholding may also be made
available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder resides under the
provisions of an applicable income tax treaty.

Backup withholding of United States federal income tax may apply to payments made in respect
of the Notes to registered owners who are not “exempt recipients” and who fail to provide certain
identifying information (such as the registered owner’s taxpayer identification number) on an
IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder, or an IRS Form W-9, in
the case of a U.S. Holder. Compliance with the identification procedures described in the preceding
section generally would establish an exemption from backup withholding for Non-U.S. Holders.
As discussed above, a Non-U.S. Holder whose gain or interest income with respect to the Notes is
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by such Non-U.S.
Holder will generally not be subject to backup withholding if the Non-U.S. Holder provides the
Withholding Agent with an IRS Form W-8ECI.

In addition, upon the sale of the Notes to (or through) a broker, the broker may be required to
withhold an appropriate percentage of the entire purchase price, unless the seller provides, in the
required manner, certain identifying information and, in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder, certifies
that such seller is a Non-U.S. Holder (and certain other conditions are met). Such a sale may also be
reported by the broker to the IRS (which report must, in certain circumstances, include the
adjusted basis of the Notes), unless the seller certifies its Non-U.S. Holder status (and certain
conditions are met). Certification of the registered owner’s Non-U.S. Holder status would be made
normally on an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E under penalties of perjury, although in
certain cases it may be possible to submit other documentary evidence.


-----

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules from a payment to a beneficial owner would be allowed as a refund or a credit against
such beneficial owner’s United States federal income tax liability provided the required information
is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.

##### Potential application of rules governing contingent payment debt instruments

We may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the stated interest or principal on the Notes,
including as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “—Optional
Redemption.” The potential obligation to pay these additional amounts may implicate the
provisions of applicable Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.”

Although the matter is not free from doubt, we do not intend to treat the Notes as contingent
payment debt instruments. However, there is no assurance that our position would be respected
by the IRS or, if challenged, upheld by a court. If the IRS were to challenge our position, the Notes
may constitute contingent payment debt instruments. If the Notes are treated as contingent
payment debt instruments, a holder that is subject to United States federal income tax may be
required to accrue OID on the Notes in excess of stated interest and otherwise applicable OID, and
to treat as ordinary income (rather than capital gain) any gain that is recognized upon a sale,
redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes. In the event that any of these contingencies
were to occur, it would affect the character, amount and timing of any income recognized. The
discussions above under “—U.S. Holders” and “—Non-U.S. Holders” assume that the Notes will not
be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the possible application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to
the Notes.

##### Foreign account tax compliance act

Sections 1471-1474 of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder (“FATCA”) impose
withholding taxes on certain types of payments made to “foreign financial institutions,” as
specially defined under FATCA, and certain other non-U.S. entities. FATCA imposes a 30%
withholding tax on payments of interest on the Notes paid to a foreign financial institution
unless the foreign financial institution is deemed to be compliant with FATCA or enters into an
agreement with the IRS to, among other things, undertake to identify accounts held by certain U.S.
persons or U.S.-owned foreign entities, annually report certain information about such accounts,
and withhold 30% on payments to account holders whose actions prevent it from complying with
these reporting and other requirements. In addition, FATCA imposes a 30% withholding tax on
the same types of payments to a non-financial foreign entity of a certain type unless the entity
certifies that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or furnishes identifying information to
the IRS or to the withholding agent regarding each substantial U.S. owner. While withholdable
payments would have originally included payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other
disposition of the Notes on or after January 1, 2019, proposed Treasury regulations provide that
such payments of gross proceeds (other than amounts treated as interest) do not constitute
withholdable payments. Taxpayers may generally rely on these proposed Treasury regulations
until they are revoked or final Treasury regulations are issued. Prospective investors should consult
their tax advisors regarding the application of FATCA to the acquisition, ownership or disposition
of the Notes.


-----

### State and local tax considerations

In addition to the United States federal income tax consequences described in “Material United
States Federal Income Tax Considerations,” you should consider the state and local income tax
consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes. State and local income tax
law may differ substantially from corresponding federal law, and this discussion does not purport
to describe any aspect of the income tax laws of any state or locality. You should consult your
tax advisor with respect to the various state and local tax consequences of an investment in the
Notes.

### Transfer restrictions

Because of the following restrictions, you are advised to consult legal counsel prior to purchasing
or making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of the Notes offered hereby.

The Notes have not been registered for offer or sale under the Securities Act or the securities laws
of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from,
or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the
securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes are being offered
and sold only to (a) QIBs purchasing for their own account or for the account of other QIBs in
reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by
Rule 144A or (b) non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S.

Prior to the U.S. Resale Restriction Termination Date (as defined in clause (3) below), each
acquirer of a beneficial interest in a Note represented by a Rule 144A Global Note or a Certificated
Note issued in exchange for interests in a Rule 144A Global Note under the limited circumstances
described under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form,” by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to
have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with the Initial Purchasers and us as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes have not been registered for offer or sale
under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they are being offered
for resale in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of
the Securities Act and the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction, including sales
pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act, and may not be offered, sold
or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom
or in a transaction not subject thereto and, in each case, in compliance with the conditions
for transfer set forth in paragraph (3) and in the Indenture.

(2) It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of ours and it is a QIB and is aware that any
transfer of Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A and that such acquisition will be
for its own account or for the account of another QIB to whom notice has been given that
such transfer is being made pursuant to Rule 144A.

(3) It (1) represents that it and any investor account for which it is acquiring Notes is a QIB to
whom notice has been given that such transfer is being made pursuant to Rule 144A, (2) agrees
to offer, sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of such Notes or any interest or
participation therein, prior to (x) the date which is six months (assuming we satisfy the current
public reporting requirements of Rule 144) or one year (if we do not) after the later of the
date of original issue of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) and the last date on which we
or any “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of ours was the owner of
such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) or any such interest or participation or (y) such later
date, if any, as may be required by any subsequent change in applicable law (the “U.S. Resale
Restriction Termination Date”) only (a) to us or any of our subsidiaries, (b) pursuant to a
registration statement which is effective under the Securities Act, (c) for so long as such Notes
are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB
acquiring such Notes or such interest or participation for its own account or for the account
of another QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A
in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, (d) to a non-U.S. person in an
offshore transaction within the meaning of, and in compliance with, Regulation S or
(e) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, subject to, in each of the foregoing cases, any requirement of law that the
disposition of such Notes or such interest or participation be at all times within its or their
control, and to compliance with the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction and with


-----

the procedures specified in the Indenture. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply
after the U.S. Resale Restriction Termination Date. Furthermore, (i) if any offer, sale or transfer
of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Note is proposed to be made prior to the U.S.
Resale Restriction Termination Date to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest
in a Regulation S Global Note, the transferor shall deliver the applicable certificate for such
offer, sale or transfer in the form prescribed in the Indenture, as described under “BookEntry, Delivery and Form—Exchanges between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes” and
(ii) if any offer, sale or transfer of a Certificated Note bearing the immediately following
legend or a substantially similar legend is proposed to be made, such transfer shall be subject
to the delivery of such certifications, legal opinions (which will be required in the case of a
transfer pursuant to clause (e) above) or other information, as may be required by the Indenture
or by the Company. It further acknowledges that each Rule 144A Global Note and each
Certificated Note issued in exchange for interests in a Rule 144A Global Note under the limited
circumstances described under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form” will bear the following
legend or a legend substantially to the following effect unless such legend is removed in
accordance with the Indenture:

OF THE COMPANY TO THE TRUSTEE.

Each acquirer of a Note, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented to and agreed with the Initial Purchasers and us as follows:

(1) It acknowledges that (a) none of us, the Initial Purchasers or any person acting on behalf of
us or the Initial Purchasers has made any representation, or warranty, express or implied, to it

and made its own assessment, and is capable of making its own assessment, of the merits and
risks of investing in the Notes, (c) it has had access to and received such financial and other

investment decision, including an opportunity to ask questions of and request information
from us and (d) the Initial Purchasers are not making any representation or warranty that the
information included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum is accurate
or complete and are not responsible in any way for such information.

(2) It has sophisticated knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and is

accounts for which it is acting are each able to bear the economic risks of its or their investment
for an indefinite period of time.


-----

(3) It acknowledges that we, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and
accuracy of its acknowledgments, representations and agreements and agrees that, if any of
its acknowledgments, representations or agreements is no longer accurate, it shall promptly
notify us and the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for
one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect
to each such account and it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgments,
representations and agreements on behalf of each such account.

(4) It agrees that it will deliver to each person to whom it transfers a Note notice of any restrictions

### Plan of distribution

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is acting as representative of each of the Initial Purchasers named
below. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement among us and the
Initial Purchasers, we have agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and each of the Initial Purchasers
has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from us, the principal amount of Notes set
forth opposite its name below.

**Principal amount**

The Initial Purchasers will purchase all of the Notes sold if any Notes are purchased. If an Initial
Purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the nondefaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated.
We have agreed to indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the Initial Purchasers may be
required to make in respect of those liabilities. The offering of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers is
subject to receipt and acceptance, and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right to reject, any order
in whole or in part.

##### Commissions and discounts

The representative has advised us that the Initial Purchasers propose initially to offer the Notes at
the offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial
offering of the Notes, the offering price or any other term of the offering of the Notes may be
changed. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates.

##### Notes are not being registered

The Notes have not been registered for offer or sale under the Securities Act or the securities laws
of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes are subject to restrictions on resale and transfer
as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes for
resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. The Initial Purchasers will
not offer or sell any Notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be QIBs or pursuant to
offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur in offshore transactions within the meaning of
Regulation S. In addition, until the expiration of the 40-day distribution compliance period, an offer
or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this offering)
may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the
offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the


-----

Securities Act. Each purchaser of Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments,
representations and agreements as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

##### New issue of notes

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to
apply for listing of the Notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes on
any automated dealer quotation system. We have been advised by certain of the Initial
Purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes after completion of the
offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue market-making
activities at any time without notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the
Notes. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity
of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from
their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities,
our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other
factors.

##### No sales of similar securities

We have agreed that, for a period of 30 days from the date of this offering memorandum, we
will not, without first obtaining the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, offer, sell,
contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company
and having a tenor of more than one year, except for the Notes sold to the Initial Purchasers
pursuant to the purchase agreement.

##### Short positions

In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers may engage in overallotment,
stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in
excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing
transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging,
fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of
the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short
positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may have the effect of
preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes or cause the price of the Notes
to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Initial
Purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at
any time.

Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the
direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price
of the Notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation
that the representatives will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once
commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

##### Alternative settlement dates

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about
, 2021, which is the tenth business day following the date hereof (such settlement
cycle being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such
trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to
the second business day preceding the Issue Date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the

trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on such
date should consult their own advisors.

##### Other relationships

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged
in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking,
advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market
making, brokerage, lending and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Certain of
the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide,
a variety of these services to us and to persons and entities with relationships with us, for which
they received or will receive customary fees and expenses, including in connection with this offering.

Pending full allocation of an amount equal to the net proceeds to Eligible Green and/or Social
Projects, we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for the Initial Use of Proceeds, which
consists of using the entire net proceeds to fund, in part, the redemption of our December 2021
Senior Notes. Prior to such use, we may use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our repurchase facilities.
To the extent that any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates own any of our December 2021
Senior Notes, upon the Initial Use of Proceeds, such Initial Purchasers or their affiliates will receive a
portion of those net proceeds. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are
lenders and/or agents under our outstanding indebtedness, and may therefore receive a portion of
the net proceeds from this offering to the extent used to repay such outstanding indebtedness.
See “Use of Proceeds.”

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective
affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of
investments, including serving as counterparties to certain derivative and hedging arrangements,
and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps
and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers,
and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or
instruments of ours (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or persons
and entities with relationships with us. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may
also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments
and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short
positions in such assets, securities and instruments.

If any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of
those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those Initial
Purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary
risk management policies. Typically, these Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge
such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default
swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered
hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices
of the Notes offered hereby.
