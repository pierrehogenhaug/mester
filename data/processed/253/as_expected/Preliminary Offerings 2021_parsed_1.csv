We utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, in conjunction with other performance metrics. The following are examples of how we utilize Non-GAAP measures: (i) our management and Board of Directors use Non-GAAP Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operational performance, to compare against work plans and budgets, and ultimately to evaluate the performance of management; (ii) our annual budgets are prepared on a non-GAAP basis; and (iii) senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using Non-GAAP Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA. While qualitative factors and judgment also affect annual bonuses, the principal quantitative element in the determination of such bonuses is performance targets tied to the work plan, and thus is based on the Non-GAAP Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA. Non-GAAP Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA have no standardized meaning and accordingly have limitations in their usefulness to investors. We provide Non-GAAP Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA because management believes that such data provide useful information to investors. However, investors are cautioned that, unlike financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, non-GAAP measures may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Non-GAAP Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses our performance.

In particular, the notes are not being marketed as “green bonds,” “social bonds” or “sustainability bonds” as the net proceeds of the issue of the notes are expected to be used for Teva’s debt refinancing and general corporate purposes. Neither the Teva Issuers nor Teva commit to (i) allocate the net proceeds specifically to projects or business activities meeting sustainability criteria or (ii) be subject to any other limitations or requirements that may be associated with green bonds, social bonds or sustainability bonds in any particular market. S-13 ----- ###### PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMEN None NYM CLN PS PMT 1C In addition, any interest rate adjustment or premium in respect of the notes as contemplated by “Description of the Euro Notes and the Guarantees” and “Description of the USD Notes and the Guarantees” herein will depend on Teva achieving, or failing to achieve, the Sustainability Performance Targets, which may be inconsistent with or insufficient to satisfy investor requirements or expectations (or other definitions relevant to scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, access to medicines and/or sustainability generally, including with regard to United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (“SDG”) 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) or SDG 13 (take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts)). Prospective investors in the notes should have regard to the information set out in the Framework (defined below) and set out in this prospectus supplement and seek advice from their independent financial adviser or other professional adviser in determining for themselves the relevance of such information for the purpose of any investment in the notes, together with any other investigation such investor deems necessary. Teva’s Sustainability Performance Targets are aimed at increasing access to Teva’s generic products on the WHO EML (defined below) as well as reducing its scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, in each case, by 2025. Teva’s Sustainability Performance Targets are therefore uniquely tailored to Teva’s business, operations and capabilities, and they do not easily lend themselves to benchmarking against similar sustainability performance targets, and the related performance, of other issuers. Furthermore, as there is currently no generally accepted definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what criteria a particular financial instrument must meet to qualify as “green”, “social,” “sustainable” or “sustainability-linked” (and, in addition, the requirements of any such label may evolve from time to time), no assurance is or can be given to investors by the Issuers, Teva, any of its subsidiaries, any second party opinion providers or the External Reviewer (as defined in “Description of the Euro notes and the Guarantees—Payment of Interest, Premium and Principal” and “Description of the USD notes and the Guarantees—Payment of Interest, Premium and Principal”) that the notes will meet any or all investor expectations regarding the notes or the Sustainability Performance Targets qualifying as “social,” “sustainable” or “sustainability-linked” or that any adverse social and/or other impacts will not occur in connection with Teva striving to achieve the Sustainability Performance Targets or the use of the net proceeds from the offering of notes. Although Teva intends to increase access to Teva’s generic products on the WHO EML and reduce its scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, there can be no assurance of the extent to which it will be successful in doing so, that any future investments it makes in furtherance of the Sustainability Performance Targets will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance, whether by any present or future applicable law or regulations or by its own by-laws or other governing rules or investment portfolio mandates, in particular with regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or social impact. Although a failure to achieve any of the Sustainability Performance Targets will give rise to a premium payment in the case of the 2027 Euro notes and the 2027 USD notes and an upward adjustment of the interest rate relating to the 2030 Euro notes and 2029 USD notes as described in “Description of the Euro Notes and the Guarantees” and “Description of the USD Notes and the Guarantees,” any such failure will not be an Event of Default under the notes nor will the Issuers be required to repurchase or redeem any notes in such circumstances.

S-60 ----- ###### PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMEN None NYM CLN PS PMT 1C Except as set forth below, the global registered USD notes will be transferable, in whole or in part, only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. DTC has advised us that it is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York; - a member of the Federal Reserve System; - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and - a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). DTC was created to hold securities of institutions that have accounts with DTC and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants in securities through electronic bookentry changes in accounts of the participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s participants include: - securities brokers and dealers; - banks; - trust companies; and - clearing corporations. Access to DTC’s book-entry system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant whether directly or indirectly. Upon the issuance of the global registered USD notes, DTC will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the respective principal amounts of the individual beneficial interests represented by the global registered USD notes to the accounts of participants. The accounts credited will be designated by the underwriters of the beneficial interests. Ownership of beneficial interests in the global registered USD notes is limited to participants or persons that may hold interests through participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in the global registered USD notes is shown on, and the transfer of those ownership interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to participants’ interests) and the participants (with respect to the owners of beneficial interests in the global registered USD notes other than participants). So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered holder and owner of the global registered USD notes, DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole legal owner of the USD notes represented by the global registered USD notes for all purposes under the indenture and the USD notes. Except as set forth below, owners of beneficial interests in the global registered USD notes will not be entitled to receive definitive registered USD notes and will not be considered to be the owners or holders of any USD notes under the global registered USD notes. Teva Finance III understands that under existing industry practice, in the event an owner of a beneficial interest in the global registered USD notes desires to take any action that DTC, as the holder of the global registered USD notes, is entitled to take, DTC would authorize the participants to take the action, and that participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through the participants to take the action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them. No beneficial owner of an interest in the global registered USD notes will be able to transfer the interest except in accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures, in addition to those provided for under the indenture and, if applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream. Teva Finance III will make payments of the principal and interest on the USD notes represented by the global registered USD notes registered in the name of and held by DTC or its nominee to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner and holder of the global registered USD notes.

Teva Finance III also expects that payments by participants and indirect participants to owners of beneficial interests in the global registered USD notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for these customers. The payments, however, will be the responsibility of the participants and indirect participants, and none of Teva Finance III, Teva, the trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for: - any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in the global registered USD notes; - maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to the beneficial ownership interests; - any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and its participants; or - the relationship between the participants and indirect participants and the owners of beneficial interests in the global registered USD notes. Unless and until they are exchanged in whole or in part for definitive registered USD notes, the global registered USD notes may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC. Participants in DTC will effect transfers with other participants in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will settle transfers in same-day funds. Participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will effect transfers with other participants in the ordinary way in accordance with the rules and operating procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. Cross-market transfers between DTC, on the one hand, and directly or indirectly through Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other, will be effected in DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its respective depositary; however, these cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in the system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (Brussels time). Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the global registered USD notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositaries for Euroclear or Clearstream. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in the global registered USD notes from a DTC participant will be credited during the securities settlement processing day immediately following the DTC settlement date, and the credit of any transactions interests in the global registered USD notes settled during the processing day will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant on that day. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in the global registered USD notes by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date, but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the Business Day following settlement in DTC. Teva Finance III expects that DTC will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of USD notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose accounts at DTC interests in the global registered USD notes are credited and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the USD notes as to which the participant or participants has or have given direction.

None of Teva Finance III, Teva, the trustee or any paying agent have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. If DTC is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as a depositary for the global registered USD notes or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and Teva Finance III does not appoint a successor depositary within 90 days, Teva Finance III will issue definitive registered USD notes in exchange for the global registered USD notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,146

In addition to interest on the notes, a U.S. Holder will be required to include in income any additional amounts paid in respect of any foreign tax withheld. If a U.S. Holder receives a payment of interest on a note denominated in euro and such U.S. Holder uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. Holder will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the interest (including additional amounts) received on the notes, determined by translating the euro received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A U.S. Holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros so received. If a U.S. Holder receives a payment of interest on a note denominated in euro and such U.S. Holder uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or such U.S. Holder is otherwise required to accrue interest prior to receipt), the U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to interest (including additional amounts) received on the notes in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, a U.S. Holder will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, a U.S. Holder may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on: - the last day of the accrual period; - the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual period straddles such U.S. Holder’s taxable year; or - the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. This election will apply to all debt obligations that a U.S. Holder holds from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the advisability of making the above election. Whether or not such election is made, with respect to notes denominated in euro, upon receipt of an interest payment on a note (including, upon the sale of a note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), a U.S. Holder will recognize U.S. source ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income such U.S. Holder previously included in income with respect to such payment.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note generally will equal its initial cost of that note. For these purposes, the amount realized does not include any amount attributable to accrued interest. Amounts attributable to accrued interest are treated as interest as described under “—Payments of Interest” above. In the case of a Euro note, a U.S. Holder’s initial cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro paid for such note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase. If a U.S. Holder’s note is sold, exchanged, redeemed, retired or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for euro, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. If a U.S. Holder is a cash method taxpayer and the notes are traded on an established securities market, euro paid or received will be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. An accrual method taxpayer may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. If such U.S. Holder is an accrual method taxpayer and does not make this election, the dollar equivalent of the amount realized will be determined by translating that amount at the dollar spot rate for euro on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition and generally will recognize foreign currency gain or loss (generally treated as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference, if any, between the dollar equivalent of the amount realized based on the spot rates in effect on the date of disposition and the settlement date. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement, or other taxable disposition the note has been held for more than one year.

A portion of a U.S. Holder’s gain or loss with respect to a Euro note may be treated as exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of such Euro note. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Euro note is the purchase price for the Euro note calculated in euro on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Euro note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date the U.S. Holder purchased the Euro note. The amount of exchange gain or loss will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Euro note. Gain or loss recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Euro note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Euro note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date principal is received from the Issuer or the U.S. Holder disposes of the Euro note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Euro note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. Holder purchased such Euro note. In addition, upon sale or other taxable disposition of a Euro note, a U.S. Holder may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of stated interest.” However, upon a sale or other taxable disposition of a Euro note, a U.S. Holder will recognize any exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. Holder on such disposition.

The below guidance as to centre of main interests and any cross-border proceedings within the EU should be construed as a description of the current law as at the date of this prospectus supplement. Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within all Member States, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (“COMI”) (which according to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation is “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”) is situated shall have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary (which presumption shall not apply if the registered office has been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1), second sentence, of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the COMI “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the COMI of a debtor, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. Recital 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the presumption should be rebutted where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If the COMI of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States, although territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. S-82 ----- ###### PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMEN None NYM CLN PS PMT 1C If the COMI of a debtor is in a Member State, under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State have jurisdiction to commence territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in another EU Member State will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under of the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex _fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency_ proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all Member States must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets.

The Member States are required to pass national laws to implement the directive by July 17, 2021, at the latest. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to harmonize the laws and procedures of Member States concerning preventive restructurings and insolvencies, to put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their quality. The key feature of the EU Restructuring Directive is the introduction of a preventive restructuring framework. The EU Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied by the Member States (i.e., minimum harmonization). Whereas certain features of the EU Restructuring Directive need to be transposed into national legislation, the EU Restructuring Directive leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the implementation of S-83 ----- ###### PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMEN None NYM CLN PS PMT 1C certain other features. In particular, when implementing the EU Restructuring Directive, Member States must ensure that, under their national laws, companies will have access to a pre-insolvency restructuring framework which permits a haircut of debt and other restructuring measures on the basis of a majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of claims in each class and where applicable a majority by numbers (meaning, for instance, that an opposing creditor can be outvoted by the majority). The EU Restructuring Directive also provides for cross-class cramdown, i.e., even if the creditors of one class voting on the restructuring plan did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the restructuring plan might still be adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors. Further, the EU Restructuring Directive provides for a stay on enforcement, which needs to be transposed into national legislation. The implementation of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation might also include priority ranking for new financing. Although the EU Restructuring Directive also foresees a number of safeguards protecting creditors from abuse and although it is not clear how exactly the EU Restructuring Directive will be implemented in individual Member States, the current domestic insolvency law of some Member States may change substantially if they lack any of the mechanisms that the EU Restructuring Directive will make mandatory. This might have considerable repercussions for the position of creditors of a Member State legal entity. The description of the current Member State domestic insolvency regimes must, therefore, be read with the understanding that they might change substantially.",N/A,as_expected,2021,146

The CERP provides for a proceeding to restructure debts of companies in financial distress outside insolvency proceedings (the “Dutch Scheme”). The CERP provides that a debtor or a court-appointed restructuring expert may offer creditors (including secured creditors) and shareholders a composition plan. Upon confirmation by the court, such plan is binding on the S-86 ----- ###### PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMEN None NYM CLN PS PMT 1C creditors and shareholders to which it has been offered and changes their rights. A composition plan under the CERP can also extend to claims against group companies of the debtor on the account of securities and guarantees for the debtor’s obligations, if inter alia (i) the relevant group companies are reasonably expected to be unable to continue to pay their debts as they fall due and (ii) the Dutch courts would have jurisdiction if the relevant group company would offer its creditors and shareholders a composition plan under the CERP. Jurisdiction of the Dutch courts under the CERP may extend to entities incorporated or residing outside the Netherlands on the basis that there is a connection with the jurisdiction of the Netherlands. Under the CERP, voting on a composition plan is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two-third of the claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two-thirds of the shares of that class that have voted on the plan. The CERP provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a non-consenting class (cross-class cram down). Under the CERP, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class. Under the CERP, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of 4 months, with a possible extension of 4 months. During such period, inter alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge. Under the CERP, claims of creditors against the Issuers can be compromised as a result of a composition plan adopted and confirmed in accordance with the CERP. A composition plan under the CERP can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the CERP can affect the rights of the trustee and/or the holders of the notes under the indentures and therefore the notes.

253_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,546,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS; LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES AND THE INDENTURES,546.3,The Netherlands,546.3.2,,"Where debtors have their COMI or an “establishment” in the Netherlands they may become subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings governed by Dutch insolvency laws. This is particularly relevant to the Issuers which are all incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and have their statutory seat (statutaire zetel) in the Netherlands, and which are therefore presumed (subject to proof to the contrary and exceptions under the EU Insolvency Regulation) to have their COMI in the Netherlands. See further “—European Union” above. Dutch insolvency laws differ significantly from insolvency proceedings in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and may make it more difficult for you to recover the amount you would normally expect to recover in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. or another jurisdiction. There are circumstances under Dutch insolvency law in which the granting by an Issuer of security and guarantees can be challenged. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Dutch insolvency laws. There are two insolvency regimes under Dutch law in relation to corporations. The first, a suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate the assets of a debtor and distribute the proceeds thereof to its creditors. In practice a suspension of payments often results in the bankruptcy of the debtor. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below. Only the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the application has been filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition (ontwerp akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted, unless a qualified minority (meaning, more than one-quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third of the number of creditors of the amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential, creditors declare against it or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. That the S-84 ----- ###### PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMEN None NYM CLN PS PMT 1C debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order, a suspension of payments will only affect unsecured, non-preferential creditors. During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in _de macht van) the debtor subject to a suspension of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the asset._ Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself, provided it has obtained prior approval of its general meeting to file an application for its own bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain parties, such as secured creditors, can benefit from special rights. Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately from bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs; however, enforcement of the security interest might be subject to the following: (i) a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order pursuant to Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (which may be a total period of eight months if the similar statutory stay of execution under Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (referred to above) is first applied during suspension of payments), which has the same effects as set forth above for stays of execution in suspensions of payment; (ii) a receiver in bankruptcy (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable time (as determined by the receiver in bankruptcy pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver in bankruptcy will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs; and (iii) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s receiver in bankruptcy and may not be offset against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor. A suspension of payment and bankruptcy proceedings against Dutch debtors would allow secured creditors (and in the case of suspension of payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against the assets (that secure their claims) as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a statutory stay of execution as described above may be ordered by the competent court both in a suspension of payments and bankruptcy. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt debtor’s assets. Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory stay of execution of security rights and other rights, as described above, may be imposed. Furthermore, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security right within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver in bankruptcy will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such set-off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although at that time it may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for the set-off. S-85 ----- ###### PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMEN None NYM CLN PS PMT 1C Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when a suspension of payments is granted, and will terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. Both a suspension of payments and bankruptcy have retroactive effect from 00.00 hours of the day on which the suspension of payments or the bankruptcy of the relevant Dutch company is declared. Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is: (i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted; and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments or bankruptcy is granted cannot be claimed in a composition. All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, entitled to distributions. If the bankruptcy has ended with a composition, a claim that has not been submitted for verification within the deadline set therefore can no longer be enforced. Any remaining funds will be distributed to the company’s shareholders. “Verification” under Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy then makes a determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings (for voting). In case of bankruptcy, creditors who wish to dispute the receiver in bankruptcy’s verification of their claims will be referred to a claim validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim, while in a suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These procedures could cause holders of notes to recover less than the principal amount of their notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. The claim validation (renvooi) proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of notes to be delayed. The claim of a creditor, other than a claim to the extent that it is secured by Dutch law security, may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Claims that fall due more than one year after the date of the bankruptcy, will be valued for distribution purposes as of the date the bankruptcy was declared. Claims that become payable within one year after the bankruptcy was declared will be considered payable from the day the bankruptcy was declared. Interest on claims accruing after the bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria, such as in case of the notes. To the extent that interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy.",N/A,as_expected,2021,146

Under this shelf process, any of the registrants may, from time to time, sell the securities described in this prospectus in one or more offerings.

However, a merger may not be approved if it is objected to by shareholders holding a majority of the voting rights participating and voting at the meeting (disregarding any abstentions), after excluding the shares held by the other party to the merger, by any person 9 ----- ###### PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMEN None NYM CLN PS PMT 1C who holds 25% or more of the other party to the merger or by anyone on their behalf, including the relatives of or corporations controlled by these persons, unless an Israeli court determines otherwise at the request of shareholders holding at least 25% of the voting rights of the company. In approving a merger, the board of directors of both merging companies must determine that there is no reasonable concern that, as a result of the merger, the surviving company will not be able to satisfy its obligations to its creditors. Similarly, upon the request of a creditor of either party to the proposed merger, an Israeli court may prevent or delay the merger if it concludes that there exists a reasonable concern that, as a result of the merger, the surviving company will not be able to satisfy the obligations of the merging parties. A court may also issue other instructions for the protection of creditors’ rights in connection with a merger. Further, a merger may not be completed unless at least (i) 50 days have passed from the time that the requisite proposals for the approval of the merger were filed with the Israeli Registrar of Companies; and (ii) 30 days have passed since the merger was approved by the shareholders of each party to the merger. Under the Companies Law, subject to certain exceptions, an acquisition of shares in a public company must be made by means of a tender offer if, as a result of the acquisition, the purchaser would hold (i) 25% or more of the voting rights of the company if there is no other holder of 25% or more of the company’s voting rights; or (ii) more than 45% of the voting rights of the company if there is no other holder of more than 45% of the company’s voting rights. This requirement does not apply to certain events set forth in the Companies Law, including a purchase of shares by an offeree in a “private placement” that receives specific shareholder approval. The board of directors must either give the shareholders its opinion as to the advisability of the tender offer or explain why it is unable to do so. The board of directors must also disclose any personal interest of any of its members in the proposed acquisition. The tender offer may be consummated only if (i) at least 5% of the company’s voting rights will be acquired; and (ii) the majority of the offerees who responded to the offer accepted the offer, excluding offerees who are controlling shareholders of the offeror, offerees who hold 25% or more of the voting rights in the company or who have a personal interest in accepting the tender offer, or anyone on their behalf or on behalf of the offeror including the relatives of or corporations controlled by these persons. Under the Companies Law, a person may not acquire shares in a public company if, after the acquisition, he will hold more than 90% of the shares or more than 90% of any class of shares of that company, unless a tender offer is made to purchase all of the shares or all of the shares of the particular class, which we refer to as a full tender offer. The Companies Law also generally provides that as long as a shareholder in a public company holds more than 90% of the company’s shares or of a class of shares, that shareholder shall be precluded from purchasing any additional shares. In order that all of the shares that the purchaser offered to purchase be transferred to the purchaser by operation of law, one of the following must have occurred: (i) the shareholders who declined or who did not respond to the full tender offer hold less than 5% of the company’s outstanding share capital or of the relevant class of shares and the majority of offerees who do not have a personal interest in accepting the full tender offer accepted the offer, or (ii) the shareholders who declined or who did not respond to the full tender offer hold less than 2% of the company’s outstanding share capital or of the relevant class of shares. If the conditions set forth above are not met, the purchaser may not acquire shares of the company from shareholders who accepted the full tender offer to the extent that following such acquisition, the purchaser would own more than 90% of the company’s issued and outstanding share capital or more than 90% of the particular class of shares with respect to which the full tender offer was made. A shareholder that had his or her shares so transferred, whether he or she accepted the full tender offer or not, has the right, within six months from the date of acceptance of the full tender offer, to petition the court to determine that the full tender offer was for less than fair value and that the fair value should be paid as determined by the court. However, subject to certain conditions, the purchaser may provide in its offer that shareholders who accept the full tender offer will not be entitled to such rights. 10 ----- ###### PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMEN None NYM CLN PS PMT 1C",N/A,as_expected,2021,146

Pursuant to the Companies Law, any transaction with an office holder or in which the office holder has a personal interest (other than with respect to such office holder’s Terms of Office and Employment) must be brought before the audit committee, in order to determine whether such transaction is an “extraordinary transaction” (defined as a transaction not in the ordinary course of business, not on market terms or likely to have a material impact on the company’s profitability, assets or liabilities). The term “Terms of Office and Employment,” as defined in the Companies Law, includes compensation, equity-based awards, releases from liability, indemnification and insurance, severance and other benefits. Pursuant to the Companies Law, the Articles and Teva policy, in the event the audit committee determines that the transaction is not an extraordinary transaction, the transaction will require only audit committee approval; if, however, it is determined to be an extraordinary transaction, board of directors approval is also required, and in some circumstances shareholder approval may also be required. Such a transaction may only be approved if it is determined to be in the best interests of Teva. A person with a personal interest in the matter generally may not be present at meetings of the board of directors or certain committees where the matter is being considered and, if a member of the board of directors or a committee, may generally not vote on the matter. _Transactions with Controlling Shareholders_ Under Israeli law, extraordinary transactions with a controlling shareholder or in which the controlling shareholder has a personal interest and any engagement with a controlling shareholder or a controlling 11 ----- ###### PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMEN None NYM CLN PS PMT 1C shareholder’s relative with respect to the provision of services to the company or with their Terms of Office and Employment as an office holder or their employment, if they are not office holders, generally require the approval of the audit committee (or with respect to Terms of Office and Employment, the compensation committee), the board of directors and the shareholders. If required, shareholder approval must include at least a majority of the shareholders who do not have a personal interest in the transaction and are present and voting at the meeting (abstentions are disregarded), or, alternatively, that the total shareholdings of the disinterested shareholders who vote against the transaction cannot represent more than two percent of the voting rights in the company. Transactions for a period of more than three years generally need to be brought for approval in accordance with the above procedures every three years. A shareholder who holds 25% or more of the voting rights in a company is considered a controlling shareholder for these purposes if no other shareholder holds more than 50% of the voting rights.

In addition, pursuant to the Companies Law, the Terms of Office and Employment of office holders generally require the approval of the compensation committee and the Board of Directors. The Terms of Office and Employment of directors (including those of a chief executive officer who is a director) further require the approval of the shareholders by a simple majority; with respect to a chief executive officer who is not a director, the approval of the shareholders by the special disinterested majority is also generally required.

ADSs may be represented by certificates that are commonly known as “American Depositary Receipts” or “ADRs.” The depositary bank typically appoints a custodian to safekeep the securities on deposit. Citibank N.A., having its principal office at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013, U.S.A., is acting as depositary bank for our ADSs and the custodians are Citibank Tel Aviv and Citibank, N.A. The Company has appointed Citibank as depositary bank pursuant to the Deposit Agreement. Each ADS represents the right to receive one ordinary share on deposit with the custodian. An ADS also represents the right to receive any other property received by the depositary bank or the custodian on behalf of the owner of the ADS but that has not been distributed to the owners of ADSs because of legal restrictions or practical considerations. The custodian, the depositary bank and their respective nominees will hold all deposited property for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of ADSs. The deposited property does not constitute the proprietary assets of the depositary bank, the custodian or their nominees. Beneficial ownership in the deposited property will under the terms of the Deposit Agreement be vested in the beneficial owners of the ADSs. The depositary bank, the custodian and their respective nominees will be the record holders of the deposited property represented by the ADSs for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of the corresponding ADSs. Owners of ADSs will be able to exercise beneficial ownership interests in the deposited property only through the registered holders of the ADSs, by the registered holders of the ADSs (on behalf of the applicable ADS owners) only through the depositary bank, and by the depositary bank (on behalf of the owners of the corresponding ADSs) directly, or indirectly through the custodian or their respective nominees, in each case upon the terms of the Deposit Agreement. Owners of ADSs become a party to the Deposit Agreement and will be bound to its terms and to the terms of any ADR that represents ADSs. The Deposit Agreement and the ADR specify the rights and obligations of the Company, the depositary bank and the ADS owners. The Deposit Agreement and the ADRs are governed by New York law. However, the Company’s obligations to the holders of ordinary shares will continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Israel, which may be different from the laws of the United States. Owners of ADSs may hold ADSs either by means of an ADR registered in their name, through a brokerage or safekeeping account, or through an account established by the depositary bank in their name reflecting the registration of uncertificated ADSs directly on the books of the depositary bank (commonly referred to as the “direct registration system” or “DRS”). The direct registration system reflects the uncertificated (book-entry) registration of ownership of ADSs by the depositary bank. Under the direct registration system, ownership of ADSs is evidenced by periodic statements issued by the depositary bank to the holders of the ADSs. The direct registration system includes automated transfers between the depositary bank and The Depository Trust Company, or DTC, the central book-entry clearing and settlement system for equity securities in the United States. 14 ----- ###### PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMEN None NYM CLN PS PMT 1C",N/A,as_expected,2021,146

The issuer may issue the debt securities in the form of one or more fully,"registered global securities that will be deposited with a depositary or its nominee identified in the applicable prospectus supplement and registered in the name of that depositary or nominee. In those cases, one or more registered global securities will be issued in a denomination or aggregate denominations equal to the portion of the aggregate principal or face amount of the securities to be represented by registered global securities. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole for securities in definitive registered form, a registered global security may not be transferred except as a whole by and among the depositary for the registered global security, the nominees of the depositary or any successors of the depositary or those nominees. If not described below, any specific terms of the depositary arrangement with respect to any securities to be represented by a registered global security will 30 ----- ###### PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMEN None NYM CLN PS PMT 1C be described in the prospectus supplement relating to those securities. We anticipate that the following provisions will apply to all depositary arrangements: Ownership of beneficial interests in a registered global security will be limited to persons, called participants, that have accounts with the depositary or persons that may hold interests through participants. Upon the issuance of a registered global security, the depositary will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the participants’ accounts with the respective principal or face amounts of the securities beneficially owned by the participants. Any dealers, underwriters or selling agents participating in the distribution of the securities will designate the accounts to be credited. Ownership of beneficial interests in a registered global security will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership interests will be effected only through, records maintained by the depositary, with respect to interests of participants, and on the records of participants, with respect to interests of persons holding through participants. The laws of some states may require that some purchasers of securities take physical delivery of these securities in definitive form. These laws may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge beneficial interests in registered global securities. So long as the depositary, or its nominee, is the registered owner of a registered global security, that depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the securities represented by the registered global security for all purposes under the applicable indenture. Except as described below, owners of beneficial interests in a registered global security will not be entitled to have the securities represented by the registered global security registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the securities in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders of the securities under the applicable indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a registered global security must rely on the procedures of the depositary for that registered global security and, if that person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participant through which the person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder under the applicable indenture. We understand that under existing industry practices, if we request any action of holders or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a registered global security desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the applicable indenture, the depositary for the registered global security would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to give or take that action, and the participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through them to give or take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners holding through them. Principal, premium, if any, and interest payments on debt securities represented by a registered global security registered in the name of a depositary or its nominee will be made to the depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner of the registered global security. None of the issuer, the guarantor, if applicable, the trustee or any other agent of the issuer, guarantor or agent of the trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the registered global security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to those beneficial ownership interests. We expect that the depositary for any of the securities represented by a registered global security, upon receipt of any payment of principal, premium, interest or other distribution of underlying securities or other property to holders on that registered global security, will immediately credit participants’ accounts in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in that registered global security as shown on the records of the depositary. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a registered global security held through participants will be governed by standing customer instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with the securities held for the accounts of customers registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of those participants. If the depositary for any of these securities represented by a registered global security is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and a successor depositary registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act is not appointed by the issuer within 90 days, the issuer will issue securities in definitive form in exchange for the registered global security that had been held by the depositary. In addition, the issuer may, at any time and in its sole discretion, 31 ----- ###### PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMEN None NYM CLN PS PMT 1C decide not to have any of the securities represented by one or more registered global securities. If the issuer makes that decision, it will issue securities in definitive form in exchange for all of the registered global security or securities representing those securities. Any securities issued in definitive form in exchange for a registered global security will be registered in the name or names that the depositary gives to the relevant trustee or other relevant agent of ours or theirs.
