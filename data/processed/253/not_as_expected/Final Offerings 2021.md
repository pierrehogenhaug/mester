_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_


**Notice to European Economic Area Investors**


This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus have been prepared on the basis that all offers of the notes will be made

pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended or superseded, the “Prospectus Regulation”), as implemented in member states
of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), from the requirement to produce a prospectus which is compliant with the Prospectus Regulation for
offers of the notes.

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer of the notes within the EEA should only do so in circumstances in which

no obligation arises for us or any of the underwriters to produce a prospectus for such offer that is compliant with the Prospectus Regulation. Neither we
nor the underwriters have authorized, nor do we or they authorize, the making of any offer of notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers
made by the underwriters, which constitute the final placement of the notes contemplated in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying
prospectus.

Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors: the notes described in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus are not

intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA.
For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive
2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution
Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014
(as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation.

_MiFID II Product Governance_

MIFID II product governance/professional investors and ECPs (defined below) only target market—Solely for the purposes of each

manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the
notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the notes (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

Each person in a Member State of the European Economic Area who receives any communication in respect of, or who acquires any notes

under, the offers to the public contemplated in this prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus will be deemed to have represented, warranted
and agreed to and with each underwriter and Teva Finance III that: (a) it is a qualified investor within the meaning of point (e) of Article 2 of the
Prospectus Regulation and any relevant implementing measure in each Member State of the European Economic Area; (b) it is not a “retail investor” as
defined above; and (c) in the case of any notes acquired by it as a financial intermediary, as that term is used in the Prospectus Regulation, (i) the notes
acquired by it in the offer

iii

**Table of Contents**

have not been acquired on behalf of, nor have they been acquired with a view to their offer or resale to, persons in any Member State other than
qualified investors, as that term is defined in the Prospectus Regulation, or in circumstances in which the prior consent of the underwriters has been
given to the offer or resale; or (ii) where notes have been acquired by it on behalf of persons in any Member State other than qualified investors, the
offer of those notes to it is not treated under the Prospectus Regulation as having been made to such persons.

**Notice to UK Investors**

_Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors_

In relation to the United Kingdom (the “UK”), each underwriter has represented and agreed, severally and not jointly, that it has not

offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any notes to any retail investor in the UK. For the purposes
of this provision the expression ‘‘retail investor’’ means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) and any rules or
regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client,
as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of

the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK
PRIIPs Regulation.

This prospectus supplement has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption

under the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the notes.

_UK MiFIR Product Governance_

Professional investors and eligible counterparties only target market: Solely for the purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval

process, the target market assessment in respect of the debt securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the debt securities is only
eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the debt securities to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. A distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance
Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the debt securities (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

_Litigation Update_

As previously disclosed in note 10 to Teva’s financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 included in its Quarterly

Report on Form 10-Q filed on October 27, 2021, on April 19, 2021, a bench trial in California (The People of the State of California, acting by and
through Santa Clara County Counsel James R. Williams, et. al. v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et. al.) commenced with Teva and other defendants focused
on the marketing of branded opioids. On November 1, 2021, the Superior Court of Orange County, California, issued a decision finding that Teva
did not cause a public nuisance in Orange County, Los Angeles County, Santa Clara County and the City of Oakland, and that Teva did not make
any false or misleading statements in connection with marketing prescription opioids in California.

**Summary Selected Historical Financial Data of Teva**

The following summary selected operating data of Teva for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020 and

summary selected balance sheet data at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are derived from Teva’s audited consolidated financial statements and related
notes incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The summary selected balance sheet data at December 31, 2018 have been derived from Teva’s
audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which are not included or incorporated by reference herein. The summary selected
operating data of Teva for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 and the summary selected balance sheet data at September 30,
2021 have been derived from the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes of Teva incorporated by reference into this
prospectus supplement and have been prepared on a basis consistent with Teva’s audited financial statements. In the opinion of management, the
financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the financial position and results of operations of Teva.
You should not rely on these interim results as being indicative of results Teva may expect for the full year or any other interim period.

The summary selected operating data of Teva for the last twelve months (“LTM”) ended September 30, 2021, has been derived by

adding the unaudited summary selected operating data of Teva for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the unaudited summary selected
operating data of Teva for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, and then subtracting the unaudited summary selected operating data of Teva
for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

The information set forth below is only a summary and is not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations of Teva, and

you should read the summary selected historical financial data together with Teva’s audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and
related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Teva’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the “Annual Report on Form 10-K”) and in Teva’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2021. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” for information on where you can obtain

(1) During the fourth quarter of 2018, we changed our accounting policy for the presentation of royalty payments to third parties that are not
involved in the production of products. We previously accounted for royalty payments to such third parties in selling and marketing expenses.
Royalties paid to a party that is involved in the production process are classified as cost of sales. We believe this change in accounting policy
is preferable in order to be aligned with industry practice of classifying all royalty payments related to currently marketed products in cost of
sales. We now report all royalty payments as cost of sales. The impact of the change in accounting policy for the year ended December 31,
2018 was an increase in cost of sales of $142 million with an offsetting decrease in selling and marketing expenses.

EBITDA, which is defined as Non-GAAP Operating Income adjusted for depreciation, each of which is considered a non-GAAP financial
measure. We utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, in conjunction with other performance metrics. The
following are examples of how we utilize Non-GAAP measures: (i) our management and Board of Directors use Non-GAAP Operating
Income and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operational performance, to compare against work plans and budgets, and ultimately to
evaluate the performance of management; (ii) our annual budgets are prepared on a non-GAAP basis; and (iii) senior management’s annual
compensation is derived, in part, using Non-GAAP Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA. While qualitative factors and judgment also
affect annual bonuses, the principal quantitative element in the determination of such bonuses is performance targets tied to the work plan,
and thus is based on the Non-GAAP Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA. Non-GAAP Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA have
no standardized meaning and accordingly have limitations in their usefulness to investors. We provide Non-GAAP Operating Income and
Adjusted EBITDA because management believes that such data provide useful information to investors. However, investors are cautioned
that, unlike financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, non-GAAP measures may not be comparable with the calculation of
similar measures for other companies. Non-GAAP Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA are presented solely to permit investors to more
fully understand how management assesses our performance. The limitations of using Non-GAAP Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA
as performance measures are that they provide a view of our results of operations without including all events during a period and may not
provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in the pharmaceutical industry.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Before you invest in the notes, you should carefully consider the risks involved. Accordingly, you should carefully consider the information_

_contained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, including the risk factors listed below,_
_those described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Teva’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other information contained in this Prospectus_
_Supplement and in the documents incorporated by reference herein, as may be updated from time to time by Teva’s subsequent reports and other filings_
_under the Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference herein. See “Where You Can Find More Information.” and “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_There may not be liquid markets for the notes, and you may not be able to sell your notes at attractive prices or at all._**

The notes are new issues of securities for which there are currently no trading markets. Although one or more of the underwriters have

advised us that they currently intend to make markets in the notes, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue their market-making activities at
any time without notice. Although application has been made to Euronext Dublin for the Euro notes to be admitted to the Official List and to trading on
the Global Exchange Market, an active market may not develop. We do not intend to apply for listing of the USD notes on any exchange or any
automated quotation system. If active markets for the notes fails to develop or be sustained, the trading prices of the notes could fall, and even if active
trading markets were to develop, the notes could trade at prices that may be lower than their respective initial offering prices. The trading prices of the
notes will depend on many factors, including:

         - prevailing interest rates and interest rate volatility;

         - the markets for similar securities;

         - our financial condition, results of operations and prospects;

         - the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community;

         - the anticipated results of acquisitions and divestitures;

         - changes in our industry and competition; and

         - general market and economic conditions.

As a result, we cannot assure you that you will be able to sell the notes at attractive prices or at all.

**_The notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors seeking exposure to assets with sustainability characteristics._**

Although the notes are issued as sustainability-linked notes, with the interest rate or premium relating to the notes being subject to an

upward adjustment in the event Teva and its consolidated subsidiaries fail to achieve any of the Sustainability Performance Targets (as defined in
“Description of the Euro notes and the Guarantees—Payment of Interest, Premium and Principal” and “Description of the USD notes and the
Guarantees—Payment of Interest, Premium and Principal” below), the notes may not satisfy an investor’s requirements or any future legal, quasi legal
or other standards for investment in assets with sustainability characteristics. In particular, the notes are not being marketed as “green bonds,” “social
bonds” or “sustainability bonds” as the net proceeds of the issue of the notes are expected to be used for Teva’s debt refinancing and general corporate
purposes. Neither the Teva Issuers nor Teva commit to (i) allocate the net proceeds specifically to projects or business activities meeting sustainability
criteria or (ii) be subject to any other limitations or requirements that may be associated with green bonds, social bonds or sustainability bonds in any
particular market.

S-13

**Table of Contents**

In addition, any interest rate adjustment or premium in respect of the notes as contemplated by “Description of the Euro Notes and the

Guarantees” and “Description of the USD Notes and the Guarantees” herein will depend on Teva achieving, or failing to achieve, the Sustainability
Performance Targets, which may be inconsistent with or insufficient to satisfy investor requirements or expectations (or other definitions relevant to
scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, access to medicines and/or sustainability generally, including with regard to United Nations
Sustainable Development Goal (“SDG”) 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) or SDG 13 (take urgent action to combat
climate change and its impacts)). Prospective investors in the notes should have regard to the information set out in the Framework (defined below) and
set out in this prospectus supplement and seek advice from their independent financial adviser or other professional adviser in determining for
themselves the relevance of such information for the purpose of any investment in the notes, together with any other investigation such investor deems
necessary.

Teva’s Sustainability Performance Targets are aimed at increasing access to Teva’s generic products on the WHO EML (defined below) as

well as reducing its scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, in each case, by 2025. Teva’s Sustainability Performance Targets are therefore uniquely tailored to
Teva’s business, operations and capabilities, and they do not easily lend themselves to benchmarking against similar sustainability performance targets,
and the related performance, of other issuers. Furthermore, as there is currently no generally accepted definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor
market consensus as to what criteria a particular financial instrument must meet to qualify as “green”, “social,” “sustainable” or “sustainability-linked”
(and, in addition, the requirements of any such label may evolve from time to time), no assurance is or can be given to investors by the Issuers, Teva,
any of its subsidiaries, any second party opinion providers or the External Reviewer (as defined in “Description of the Euro notes and the Guarantees
—Payment of Interest, Premium and Principal” and “Description of the USD notes and the Guarantees—Payment of Interest, Premium and Principal”)
that the notes will meet any or all investor expectations regarding the notes or the Sustainability Performance Targets qualifying as “social,”
“sustainable” or “sustainability-linked” or that any adverse social and/or other impacts will not occur in connection with Teva striving to achieve the
Sustainability Performance Targets or the use of the net proceeds from the offering of notes.

Although Teva intends to increase access to Teva’s generic products on the WHO EML and reduce its scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, there

can be no assurance of the extent to which it will be successful in doing so, that any future investments it makes in furtherance of the Sustainability
Performance Targets will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance, whether by any
present or future applicable law or regulations or by its own by-laws or other governing rules or investment portfolio mandates, in particular with regard
to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or social impact. Although a failure to achieve any of the Sustainability Performance Targets will
give rise to a premium payment in the case of the 2027 Euro notes and the 2027 USD notes and an upward adjustment of the interest rate relating to the
2030 Euro notes and 2029 USD notes as described in “Description of the Euro Notes and the Guarantees” and “Description of the USD Notes and the
Guarantees,” any such failure will not be an Event of Default under the notes nor will the Issuers be required to repurchase or redeem any notes in such
circumstances.

Any such event or failure to meet the Sustainability Performance Targets as aforesaid and/or the withdrawal of any such opinion or

certification or any such opinion or certification attesting that we are not complying in whole or in part and/or the withdrawal of any such opinion or
certification or any such opinion or certification attesting that we are not complying in whole or in part with any matters for which such opinion or
certification is opining or certifying on and/or the notes no longer being listed or admitted to trading on any stock exchange or securities market may
have a material adverse effect on the value of the notes and/or result in adverse consequences for certain investors with portfolio mandates to invest in
securities to be used for or towards a particular purpose.

**Table of Contents**

**_No assurance or representation is given as to the suitability or reliability of any opinion, report or certification of any third party in connection with_**
**_the offering of the notes or the Sustainability Performance Targets to fulfill any green, social, sustainability, sustainability-linked and/or other_**
**_criteria._**

The second party opinion providers and providers of similar opinions and certifications are not currently subject to any specific regulatory

or other regime or oversight. The second party opinion or any other similar opinions and certifications are not incorporated into, and do not form part of,
this prospectus supplement. Any such opinion or certification is not, nor should be deemed to be, a recommendation by the Issuers, Teva, any of its
subsidiaries, any second party opinion providers, the External Reviewer or any other person to buy, sell or hold notes. Noteholders have no recourse
against the Issuers, Teva or the provider of any such opinion or certification for the contents of any such opinion or certification, which is only current as
of the date it was initially issued. Prospective investors must determine for themselves the relevance of any such opinion or certification and/or the
information contained therein and/or the provider of such opinion or certification for the purpose of any investment in the notes.

**_No assurance or representation is given as to whether the admission of the Euro notes to trading on the sustainability-linked segment of Euronext_**
**_Dublin will satisfy investment criteria or investor guidelines._**

The Euro notes are expected to be admitted to the Sustainability-Linked Segment of Euronext Dublin. We do not give, nor do the Issuers

or any other person give, any representation or assurance that such listing or admission satisfies, whether in whole or in part, any present or future
investor expectations or requirements as regards to any investment criteria or guidelines with which such investor or its investments are required to
comply, whether by any present or future applicable law or regulations or by its own governing rules or investment portfolio mandates, in particular with
regard to any direct or indirect sustainable impact of any of the Sustainability Performance Targets. Furthermore, the criteria for any such listings or
admission to trading may vary from one stock exchange or securities market to another. No representation or assurance is given or made by us or the
underwriters or any other person that any such listing or admission to trading will be obtained in respect of any Euro notes or, if obtained, that any such
listing or admission to trading will be maintained during the life of the Euro notes.

**_There can be no assurance that stakeholders will agree on a decision as to whether certain projects or investments will contribute to a particular_**
**_SDG._**

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals “SDGs” are aspirational in nature. The analysis involved in determining whether and

how certain initiatives may contribute to the SDGs is inherently subjective and dependent on a number of factors. There can be no assurance that
reasonable parties, including Teva will agree on a decision as to whether certain projects or investments contribute to a particular SDG. Accordingly,
investors should not place undue reliance on Teva’s application of the SDGs, as such application is subject to change at any time and in Teva’s sole
discretion.

**_Achieving the Sustainability Performance Targets could become controversial or have a reputational effect on our business._**

Our results of operations depend on maintaining a positive reputation with our customers and other participants in the healthcare industry,

including providers and payors. Any negative incident could significantly affect our reputation and damage our business. We may be adversely affected
by any negative publicity, regardless of its accuracy. Teva’s efforts in achieving the Sustainability Performance Targets may further become
controversial or be criticized by activist groups or other stakeholders. In addition, through the increased use of social media, individuals and
non-governmental organizations have the ability to disseminate their opinions regarding our products, and our business, to an increasingly wide
audience at a faster pace. Any failure to effectively respond to any negative opinions or publicity in a timely manner could harm the perception of our
brand and products and damage our reputation, regardless of the validity of the statements against us and ultimately harm our business.

**Table of Contents**

**_Achieving the Sustainability Performance Targets or any similar sustainability performance targets will require Teva to expend significant_**
**_resources, while failure by Teva to achieve any such targets would result in increased payments and could expose Teva to reputational risks._**

As described in “Description of the Euro notes and the Guarantees—Payment of Interest, Premium and Principal—Definitions and

General Terms Relating to Sustainability Performance Targets” and “Description of the USD notes and the Guarantees—Payment of Interest, Premium
and Principal—Definitions and General Terms Relating to Sustainability Performance Targets” achieving the Sustainability Performance Targets will
require Teva to (i) increase its cumulative number of regulatory submissions in LMICs (as defined in “Description of the Euro notes and the Guarantees
—Payment of Interest, Premium and Principal—Definitions and General Terms Relating to Sustainability Performance Targets”) on the WHO EML
across six key treatment areas by the end of 2025 by at least 150% as compared to the regulatory submissions made during the baseline period of
2017-2020, (ii) increase access to essential medicine volume by 150%, by the end of 2025 compared to the doses made available in the baseline year of
2020 and (iii) reduce its scopes 1 and 2 absolute GHG emissions by at least 25% by the end of 2025 through four access to medicine programs,
including donations and social business in LMIC on the WHO’s EML across six key TAs compared to 2019 baseline levels. As a result, achieving the
Sustainability Performance Targets or any similar sustainability performance targets Teva may choose to include in future financings or other
arrangements will require Teva to expend significant resources.

In addition, a failure by Teva to achieve any of the Sustainability Performance Targets or any such similar sustainability performance

targets Teva may choose to include in any future financings would not be an event of default under the notes, nor will we be required to repurchase or
redeem the notes. However, it would require us to pay an increased interest rate on the 2030 Euro notes and 2029 USD notes and a premium on the 2027
Euro notes and 2027 USD notes, which may have an adverse impact on our liquidity and financial position. In addition, it could also harm Teva’s
reputation, the consequences of which could, in each case, have a material adverse effect on Teva, its business prospects, its financial condition or its
results of operations. Should we satisfy the Sustainability Performance Targets, holders of notes will not be entitled to an increase in the interest rate or a
premium payment.

**_Even if we meet the Sustainability Performance Targets in 2025, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet our Sustainability_**
**_Performance Targets thereafter._**

Even if we meet one or more of our Sustainability Performance Targets by December 31, 2025, there can be no assurance that we will

continue to maintain the levels set by our Sustainability Performance Targets in the future. In addition, even if we meet our Sustainability Performance
Targets by December 31, 2025, we may not be successful in continuing to improve our sustainability metrics in line with our longer-term sustainability
targets as set out in the Framework or we may meet such targets later than anticipated. There will be no penalties in the indentures governing the notes
or any other agreement associated with failing to maintain the levels set by either or both of our Sustainability Performance Targets or by failing to meet
any future sustainability targets.

**_Calculation and reporting of our key performance indicators on which our Sustainability Performance Targets are based may change over time._**

The scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction and medicine access key performance indicators on which our Sustainability Performance

Targets are based are calculated internally by Teva based on broadly accepted industry standards. These standards and guidelines may change over time,
which may affect the way in which we calculate our key performance indicators. The standards and guidelines continue to be reviewed by expert groups
and include contributions from industry bodies, which may change going forward. Furthermore, any significant change to the calculation methodology
of the Sustainability Performance Targets or significant change in data due to better data accessibility or discovery of data errors or significant structural
change such as acquisitions, divestitures or mergers may result in a recalculation of the relevant baselines and/or Sustainability Performance Targets. We
expect to report on an annual basis on progress on our key performance indicators, including an

S-16

**Table of Contents**

explanation of methodologies used in such calculations, but a failure to do so will not constitute a default or event of default under the notes or any other
agreement.

**_Teva’s ability to achieve the Sustainability Performance Targets depends on a number of factors outside Teva’s control._**

Teva’s ability to achieve the Sustainability Performance Targets is directly linked to its ability to increase regulatory submissions, and

establish access programs dedicated to LMICs (as defined in “Description of the Euro notes and the Guarantees—Payment of Interest, Premium and
Principal—Definitions and General Terms Relating to Sustainability Performance Targets”) and decrease Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. Meeting these
targets in turn depends on a number of factors outside Teva’s control, including the impact of and regulatory and market response to climate change,
local health systems, supply continuity, political and economic stability, local regulatory requirements, manufacturing and supply shortages,
transportation and supply access, the performance of certain outsourced functions by third parties as well as other factors.

**_The Euro notes may not become, or remain, listed on Euronext Dublin._**

Although Teva Finance II will, pursuant to the indenture governing the Euro notes, agree to make an application to have the Euro notes

listed on Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof within a reasonable period after the issue date and to maintain
such listing as long as the Euro notes are outstanding, Teva Finance II cannot assure you that the Euro notes will become, or remain, listed. If Teva
Finance II cannot maintain the listing on Euronext Dublin and the admission to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof or it becomes unduly
burdensome to make or maintain such listing, Teva Finance II may cease to make or maintain such listing on Euronext Dublin, provided that it will use
reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Euro notes on another securities exchange, although there can be no assurance that Teva
Finance II will be able to do so. Although no assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Euro notes as a result of listing on Euronext Dublin or
another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance with the indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the
Euro notes from Euronext Dublin or another listing exchange in accordance with the indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability
to resell Euro notes in the secondary market. We do not intend to apply for the Euro notes to be listed on any U.S. securities exchange or to arrange for
quotation on any automated dealer quotation system.

**_A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to the notes, if any, could cause the liquidity or market values of_**
**_the notes to decline significantly._**

We cannot assure you what ratings will be assigned to the notes. In addition, we cannot assure you that any rating so assigned will remain

for any given period of time or that the rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future
circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. A downgrade of Teva’s credit rating could
negatively affect the liquidity or market values of the notes.

**_We may be unable to refinance our indebtedness._**

We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the notes, before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be

able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient
funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness that may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations under the notes._**

The terms of the notes do not impose any limitation on the ability of Teva, the Issuers or any of Teva’s other subsidiaries to incur

additional unsecured debt. We may incur additional unsecured indebtedness in the

S-17


-----

**Table of Contents**

future, which could have important consequences to holders of notes, including that we could have insufficient cash to meet our financial obligations,
including our obligations under the notes, and that our ability to obtain additional financing could be impaired.

**_Holders of the notes will vote jointly together with holders of the relevant Issuer’s other outstanding Securities under the applicable indenture with_**
**_respect to amendments that affect all of such Securities._**

We and the trustee may modify the applicable indenture and the rights of the holders of Securities (as defined in “Description of the Euro

Notes and Guarantees” and “Description of the USD Notes and the Guarantees,” as applicable) outstanding under such indenture with the consent of the
holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Securities outstanding under that indenture affected by the modification. Accordingly,
following consummation of the offering and application of the proceeds therefrom, €5,048 million of Securities will be outstanding under the indenture
governing the Euro notes and $5,210 million of Securities will be outstanding under the indenture governing the USD notes, and holders of such
Securities, including the holders of the Euro notes and the USD notes offered hereby, respectively, will vote together as a single class with respect to
certain matters thereunder the applicable indenture; provided that certain modifications to certain fundamental items may only be amended with the
consent of each affected holder.

**_Because Teva and the Issuers are foreign entities, you may have difficulties enforcing your rights under the guarantee and under the notes._**

Teva is organized under the laws of Israel and certain of Teva’s directors and officers reside outside of the United States. As a result,

service of process on them may be difficult or impossible to effect in the United States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of Teva’s assets are located
outside of the United States. Therefore, any judgment obtained in the United States against us or any of our directors and officers may not be collectible
within the United States.

Subject to various time limitations, an Israeli court may declare a judgment rendered by a foreign court in a civil matter, including

judgments awarding monetary or other damages in non-civil matters, enforceable if it finds that:

1. the judgment was rendered by a court which was, according to the foreign country’s law, competent to render it;

2. the judgment is no longer appealable;

3. the obligation in the judgment is enforceable according to the rules relating to the enforceability of judgments in Israel and the
substance of the judgment is not contrary to public policy in Israel; and

4. the judgment can be executed in the state in which it was given.

A foreign judgment will not be declared enforceable by Israeli courts if it was given in a state, the laws of which do not provide for the

enforcement of judgments of Israeli courts (subject to exceptional cases) or if its enforcement is likely to prejudice the sovereignty or security of Israel.
An Israeli court also will not declare a foreign judgment enforceable if it is proven to the Israeli court that:

1. the judgment was obtained by fraud;

2. there was no due process;

3. the judgment was given by a court not competent to render it according to the laws of private international law in Israel;

4. the judgment conflicts with another judgment that was given in the same matter between the same parties and which is still valid; or

S-18


-----

**Table of Contents**

5. at the time the action was brought to the foreign court a claim in the same matter and between the same parties was pending before a
court or tribunal in Israel.

The Issuers are organized under the laws of The Netherlands, their managing and supervisory directors reside outside the United States,

and all or a significant portion of the assets of such persons are, and substantially all of their assets are, located outside the United States. As a result, it
may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuers or any such person or to enforce against the Issuers or any such
person judgments obtained in United States courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

Because there is no treaty on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters between the United States and

The Netherlands, courts in The Netherlands will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a United States federal or state
court. However, a final judgment obtained in a United States federal or state court after a substantive examination of the merits (and not by mere
“default judgment”) which is not subject to appeal or other means of contestation and is enforceable in the United States with respect to the payment of
obligations of a Dutch entity under the documents expressed to be subject to United States federal or state securities laws (such as, inter alia, the notes
and the indenture) would generally be upheld and be regarded by a Dutch court of competent jurisdiction as conclusive evidence when asked to render a
judgment in accordance with that judgment by a United States federal or state court, without substantive re-examination or re-litigation of the merits of
the original judgment, provided that:

1. the judgment results from legal proceedings that comply with the standards of the proper administration of justice that includes
sufficient safeguards (behoorlijke rechtspleging);

2. that judgment has been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, in accordance with the principles of due justice, its contents
and enforcement do not conflict with Dutch public policy (openbare orde) and it has not been rendered in proceedings of a criminal
law or revenue or other public law nature;

3. the jurisdiction of the relevant federal or state court in the United States has been based on grounds that are internationally
acceptable; and

4. the judgment is not incompatible with a decision rendered between the same parties by a court in the Netherlands, or with a previous
decision rendered between the same parties by a foreign court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same
cause, provided that the previous decision qualifies for acknowledgement in the Netherlands.

Enforcement of obligations before the courts of The Netherlands will be subject to the degree to which the relevant obligations are

enforceable under their governing law, to the nature of the remedies available in the courts of The Netherlands, the acceptance by such courts of
jurisdiction, the effect of provisions imposing prescription periods and to the availability of defenses such as set off (unless validly waived) and counterclaim.

**_The guarantees will effectively be subordinated to some of our existing and future indebtedness._**

Teva will irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the punctual payment when due of the principal of and interest, if any, on the notes.

As indebtedness of Teva, the guarantees will be Teva’s general, unsecured obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with all of Teva’s
existing and future unsubordinated, unsecured indebtedness. The guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured
indebtedness Teva may have up to the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness and structurally subordinated to any existing and future
liabilities and other indebtedness of our subsidiaries with respect to the assets of those subsidiaries. These liabilities may include debt securities, credit
facilities, trade payables, guarantees, lease obligations, letter of credit obligations and other indebtedness. See “Description of the USD Notes and the
Guarantee—Description of the Guarantees” and “Description of the Euro Notes and the Guarantee—Description of the Guarantees.” The indentures
governing the notes do not restrict us or our

S-19

**Table of Contents**

subsidiaries from incurring debt in the future, nor do the indentures limit the amount of indebtedness we can issue that is equal in right of payment. As
of September 30, 2021, after giving effect to this offering, Teva had no secured indebtedness outstanding, and its subsidiaries, other than finance
subsidiaries, had a de minimis amount of indebtedness outstanding.

**_Teva may be subject to restrictions on receiving dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries._**

Teva’s income is derived in large part from its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Teva’s ability to pay its obligations under the guarantees depends

in part on the earnings of its subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to Teva, whether in the form of dividends, loans or advances. Such payment
by Teva’s subsidiaries to Teva may be subject to restrictions. The indentures governing the notes do not restrict Teva, the Issuers or Teva’s other
subsidiaries from entering into agreements that contain such restrictions.

**_An investment in the notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not U.S. dollars or euros, as applicable, entails significant risks._**

An investment in the notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not U.S. dollars or euros, as applicable, entails significant risks. These

risks include the possibility of significant changes in rates of exchange between the holder’s home currency and the U.S. dollar or euro, as applicable,
and the possibility of the imposition or subsequent modification of foreign exchange controls. These risks generally depend on factors over which we
have no control, such as economic, financial and political events and the supply of and demand for the relevant currencies. In the past, rates of exchange
between the U.S. dollar or euro, as applicable, and certain currencies have been highly volatile, and each holder should be aware that volatility may
occur in the future. Fluctuations in any particular exchange rate that have occurred in the past, however, are not necessarily indicative of fluctuations in
the rate that may occur during the terms of the notes. Depreciation of the U.S. dollar or euro, as applicable, against the holder’s home currency would
result in a decrease in the effective yield of the notes, below its coupon rate and, in certain circumstances, could result in a loss to the holder. Investment
in the notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not U.S. dollars or euros, as applicable, may also have important tax consequences.

**_The procedures for book-entry interests to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of_**
**_your rights under the Euro notes._**

Unless and until Euro notes in definitive registered form are issued in exchange for global notes, owners of book-entry interests will not be

considered owners or holders of the Euro notes except in the limited circumstances provided in the indenture governing the Euro notes. The common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream (or its nominee) will be the sole registered holder of the global Euro notes representing the Euro notes. After
payment to the common depositary, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of
book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if
you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights
and obligations of a holder under the indenture governing the Euro notes.

Unlike the holders of the Euro notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations

for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Euro notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act
only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such
proxies may not be sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture governing the Euro notes, if you own a book-entry interest, you

will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream may not be adequate
to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Euro notes.

**_The Euro notes and the USD notes have minimum specified denominations of €100,000 and $200,000, respectively._**

The Euro notes have minimum denominations of €100,000 and multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The USD notes have minimum

denominations of $200,000 and multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. It is therefore possible that notes may be traded in amounts that would cause a
holder of notes to hold a principal amount of less than €100,000 or $200,000, as applicable, following such trade. In such a case, a holder of notes who
holds a principal amount of less than €100,000 or $200,000, as applicable, may not receive a definitive certificate in respect of such holding (should
definitive certificates be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of notes such that its holding amounts to at least €100,000 or $200,000,
as applicable.

**_In a lawsuit for payment on the Euro notes, an investor may bear currency exchange risk._**

The Euro notes and the indenture governing the Euro notes will be governed by the laws of the State of New York. Under New York law, a

New York state court rendering a judgment on the Euro notes would be required to render the judgment in euros. The judgment would be converted into
U.S. dollars, however, at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the Euro notes,
investors would bear currency exchange risk until a New York state court judgment is entered. A U.S. federal court sitting in New York with diversity
jurisdiction over a dispute arising in connection with the Euro notes would apply the foregoing New York law.

In courts outside of New York, investors may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a

judgment for money in an action based on the Euro notes in many other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States
only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of euros into U.S. dollars would depend upon various factors, including which
court renders the judgment and when the judgment is rendered.

significant products; our ability to develop and commercialize biopharmaceutical products; competition for our specialty products,
including AUSTEDO[®], AJOVY[®] and COPAXONE[®]; our ability to achieve expected results from investments in our product
pipeline; our ability to develop and commercialize additional pharmaceutical products; and the effectiveness of our patents and other
measures to protect our intellectual property rights;

         - our substantial indebtedness, which may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, engage in additional transactions or make

breaches of our data security; variations in intellectual property laws; challenges associated with conducting business globally,
including political or economic instability, major hostilities or terrorism; costs and delays resulting from the extensive
pharmaceutical regulation to which we are subject or delays in governmental processing time due to travel and work restrictions
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; the effects of reforms in healthcare regulation and reductions in pharmaceutical pricing,
reimbursement and coverage; significant sales to a limited number of customers; our ability to successfully bid for suitable
acquisition targets or licensing opportunities, or to consummate and integrate acquisitions; and our prospects and opportunities for
growth if we sell assets;

         - compliance, regulatory and litigation matters, including: failure to comply with complex legal and regulatory environments;

         - other financial and economic risks, including: our exposure to currency fluctuations and restrictions as well as credit risks; potential
impairments of our intangible assets; potential significant increases in tax liabilities (including as a result of potential tax reform in
the United States); and the effect on our overall effective tax rate of the termination or expiration of governmental programs or tax
benefits, or of a change in our business.

The forward-looking statements contained or incorporated by reference herein involve a number of known and unknown risks and

uncertainties that could cause our future results, performance or achievements to differ significantly from the results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. You should understand that many important factors, in addition to those discussed or
incorporated by reference in this prospectus, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.
Potential factors that could affect our results, include, in addition to others not described in this prospectus supplement, those referenced under “Risk
Factors.” These are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expected results.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any

forward-looking statements or other information contained in this prospectus supplement, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise, except as may be required by law. You are advised, however, to consult any additional disclosures we make in our Annual Reports on Form

**SUSTAINABILITY-LINKED FINANCING FRAMEWORK**

In connection with this offering, we adopted the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework (the “Framework”) which relates to our

sustainability strategy and targets to foster best market practices in accordance with the Sustainability-Linked Bonds Principles (the “SLBP”)
administered by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA). The Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework was published on our website
at https://ir.tevapharm.com/SLB.

The second party opinions were obtained from ISS and the Access to Medicines Foundation, which are accessible through the Company’s

website at https://ir.tevapharm.com/SPO and https://ir.tevapharm.com/ATMF, respectively. While we believe that the second party opinions are
reasonable, we make no representation about the suitability of the second party opinions or the notes to fulfill any environmental and sustainability
criteria. Investors should conduct their own assessment of the notes from a sustainability perspective.

We will report annually on our performance with respect to the Sustainability Performance Targets for the preceding calendar year.

The contents of our website, including any references made to information accessible therein, including the Framework, the second party

opinions and the annual reports on our performance with respect to the Sustainability Performance Targets, do not form part of, and are not incorporated

_Teva Finance II will issue € 1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.750% Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2027 (for this_

_section, the “2027 Euro notes”) and €1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2030 (for this section,_
_the “2030 Euro notes” and, together with the 2027 Euro notes, the “Euro notes”) under a senior indenture dated as of March 14, 2018, by and among_
_Teva Finance II, Teva and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (for this section, the “base indenture”), as supplemented by a third supplemental_
_indenture, to be dated on or about November 9, 2021, by and among Teva Finance II, Teva, The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, and The Bank of_
_New York Mellon, London Branch, as paying agent (for this section, the “third supplemental indenture”). The terms of the Euro notes of each series_
_include those provided in the indenture. Teva will irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the punctual payment by Teva Finance II of the principal of_
_and premium and interest, if any, on the Euro notes of each series and all other amounts due and payable under the indenture._

_The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Euro notes of each series and the related indenture and_

_guarantee. We urge you to read these documents in their entirety because they, and not this description, define your rights as holders of the Euro notes._
_You may request copies of these documents at our address set forth in the section titled “Incorporation of Certain Documents by Reference.”_

_When we refer to Teva or the guarantor in this section, we refer only to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited, an Israeli corporation._

_When we refer to Teva Finance II or the issuer in this section, we refer to Teva Pharmaceutical Finance Netherlands II B.V., an indirect, wholly-owned_
_subsidiary of Teva organized as a Dutch private limited liability company._

_For this section, we refer to the base indenture, as supplemented by the third supplemental indenture, as “the indenture”; and we refer to_

_the 2027 Euro notes and the 2030 Euro notes each as a series of Euro notes and, collectively, as the “Euro notes.”_

**Brief Description of the Euro notes**

The Euro notes will:

         - initially be limited to

             - €1,100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Euro notes; and

             - €1,500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Euro notes;

subject to reopening of the Euro notes at the discretion of the issuer;

         - accrue interest at a rate of 3.750% per annum, on the 2027 Euro notes and 4.375% per annum on the 2030 Euro notes, in each case
payable semi-annually in arrears on May 9 and November 9 of each year, beginning on May 9, 2022, provided that the interest rate
on the 2030 Euro notes shall be subject to adjustment as described under “Interest Rate Adjustment For 2030 Euro notes Upon
_Failure to Achieve Sustainability Performance Targets” below;_

         - constitute general unsecured obligations of the issuer;

         - be redeemable (in addition to being redeemable as set forth below under “—Tax Redemption”) at the option of Teva Finance II in
whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, upon at least 10 days’, but not more than 60 days’, prior notice, at the
redemption prices described under “—Optional Redemption by the Issuer”;

         - mature on May 9, 2027, in the case of the 2027 Euro notes and on May 9, 2030, in the case of the 2030 Euro notes, in each case
unless earlier redeemed by the issuer; and

S-29

**Table of Contents**

         - provide for a potential one-time premium payment upon maturity or redemption as described under “—Premium Payment For 2027
Euro notes Upon Failure to Achieve Sustainability Performance Targets” below.

The indenture does not contain any financial covenants or restrictions on the amount of additional indebtedness that Teva, Teva Finance II

or any of Teva’s other subsidiaries may incur except as described in “—Certain Covenants” below. The indenture does not protect you in the event of a
highly leveraged transaction or change of control of Teva or Teva Finance II. The indenture does not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or
payment of a consent fee to holders. The Euro notes do not contain any sinking fund provisions. Following consummation of the offering and
application of the proceeds therefrom, €5,048 million of Securities (as defined in the base indenture) will be outstanding under the indenture, and
holders of such Securities, including the holders of the Euro notes, will vote together as a single class with respect to certain matters thereunder.

Teva Finance II may, without the consent of the holders, issue additional Euro notes of any series under the indenture with the same terms

(except for the issue date, issue price and, in some cases, the first payment of interest or interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Euro
notes) and with the same ISIN number as the Euro notes of such series offered hereby in an unlimited aggregate principal amount; provided that if the
additional Euro notes of a series are not fungible with the Euro notes of such series for United States federal income tax purposes, such additional Euro
notes will have a separate ISIN number. Any additional debt securities having such similar terms, together with the Euro notes of such series, could be
considered part of the same series of Euro notes under the indenture; provided that, in the case of any Euro notes represented by global Euro notes, for
so long as may be required by the Securities Act or the procedures of the common depositary, Euroclear or Clearstream (or a successor or clearing
system), such additional Euro notes of such series will be represented by one or more separate global Euro notes in accordance with the terms of the
indenture and subject to applicable transfer or other restrictions. We may also from time to time repurchase Euro notes in open market purchases or
negotiated transactions without giving prior notice to holders.

Application has been made to Euronext Dublin to list the Euro notes on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and to admit the Euro notes to

trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof. The application to list the Euro notes on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and to admit the Euro
notes to trading on the Global Exchange Market may not be approved and settlement is not conditioned on obtaining such listing.

**Description of the Guarantees**

Teva will irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, upon redemption, by

acceleration or otherwise, of the principal of and premium and interest (including any additional amounts in respect of taxes as provided herein), if any,
on the Euro notes of each series as well as all other amounts due and payable under the indenture. The respective guarantees will be enforceable by the
trustee, the holders of the applicable Euro notes and their successors, transferees and assigns. Teva will also guarantee the USD notes issued in this
offering.

Each guarantee will be an unsecured senior obligation of Teva. As indebtedness of Teva, after giving effect to the offerings contemplated

hereby, each guarantee will rank:

         - senior to the rights of creditors under indebtedness expressly subordinated to the guarantee (at September 30, 2021, Teva had no
subordinated indebtedness outstanding);

         - equally with other unsecured indebtedness of Teva from time to time outstanding other than any that is subordinated to the guarantee
(at September 30, 2021, Teva had approximately $23.5 billion of senior unsecured indebtedness outstanding);

         - effectively junior to Teva’s secured indebtedness up to the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness (at September 30, 2021,
Teva had no secured indebtedness outstanding); and

S-30

**Table of Contents**

         - effectively junior to the indebtedness and other liabilities of Teva’s subsidiaries (other than the issuer) (at September 30, 2021,
Teva’s subsidiaries, other than finance subsidiaries, had a de minimis amount of indebtedness outstanding).

Subject to any adjustment in accordance with “Interest Rate Adjustment For 2030 Euro notes Upon Failure to Achieve Sustainability

Performance Targets” below, the 2027 Euro notes and the 2030 Euro notes will bear interest at the rate of 3.750% per year and 4.375% per year,
respectively, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 9 and November 9 of each year, beginning May 9, 2022, to the holders of record at the close of
business on the Business Day (as defined below) immediately preceding the related interest payment date. If an interest payment date for the Euro notes
falls on a day that is not a Business Day, interest will be payable on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such
interest payment date and no interest shall accrue thereon on account of such delay. Interest on the Euro notes will be computed on the basis of a
360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months, and will accrue from November 9, 2021, or from the most recent interest payment date to which
interest has been paid to, but not including, the next interest payment date.

“Business Day” means any day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets are open for business in New York and

London; provided that, for purposes of payments on the Euro notes, a “Business Day” must be a day on which the Trans-European Automated RealTime Gross Settlement Express Transfer System (TARGET) is operating.

**_Interest Rate Adjustment For 2030 Euro notes Upon Failure to Achieve Sustainability Performance Targets_**

From and including May 9, 2026 (the “Step-up Date”) the interest rate payable on the 2030 Euro notes (but not the 2027 Euro notes) shall

increase by:

(a) 0.125% per annum unless Teva has achieved the Regulatory Submissions Target as of the Testing Date;

(b) 0.125% per annum unless Teva has achieved the Product Volume Target as of the Testing Date; and

(c) 0.125% per annum unless Teva has achieved the Emission Reduction Target as of the Testing Date;

in each case, as certified by the Issuer or Teva to the trustee in an officer’s certificate (which shall include the Assurance Letter as an exhibit thereto) on
or prior to the Certification Date (subject to any clerical or administrative errors (including any delays resulting therefrom)); provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt:

(i) the interest rate on the 2030 Euro notes shall not increase on the Step-up Date if Teva has achieved the three Sustainability Performance

Targets as of the Testing Date and certified to such on or prior to the Certification Date;

(ii) the increase in the interest rate on the 2030 Euro notes on the Step-up Date shall not exceed a total of 0.125% if Teva has achieved two

of the three Sustainability Performance Targets as of the Testing Date and certified to such on or prior to the Certification Date;

(iii) the increase in the interest rate on the 2030 Euro notes on the Step-up Date shall not exceed a total of 0.250% if Teva has met one of

the three Sustainability Performance Targets as of the Testing Date and certified to such on or prior to the Certification Date; and

S-31

**Table of Contents**

(iv) in no event shall the total increase in the interest rate on the 2030 Euro notes on the Step-up Date exceed 0.375% (this being the

consequence of Teva failing to achieve any of the three Sustainability Performance Targets on the Testing Date and failing to certify to achievement on
or prior to the Certification Date).

**_Premium Payment For 2027 Euro notes Upon Failure to Achieve Sustainability Performance Targets_**

At maturity or upon earlier redemption of the 2027 Euro notes (but only if such redemption is on or after the Step-up Date), the following

premium shall be payable on the 2027 Euro notes (but not the 2030 Euro notes):

(a) 0.150% of the principal amount repaid unless Teva has achieved the Regulatory Submissions Target as of the Testing Date;

(b) 0.150% of the principal amount repaid unless Teva has achieved the Product Volume Target as of the Testing Date; and

(c) 0.150% of the principal amount repaid unless Teva has achieved the Emission Reduction Target as of the Testing Date;

in each case, as certified by the Issuer or Teva to the trustee in an officer’s certificate (which shall include the Assurance Letter as an exhibit thereto) on
or prior to the Certification Date (subject to any clerical or administrative errors (including any delays resulting therefrom)); provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt:

(i) no premium shall be payable on the 2027 Euro notes if Teva has achieved the three Sustainability Performance Targets as of the Testing

Date and certified to such on or prior to the Certification Date;

(ii) the premium on the 2027 Euro notes shall not exceed a total of 0.150% of the principal amount repaid if Teva has achieved two of the

three Sustainability Performance Targets as of the Testing Date and certified to such on or prior to the Certification Date;

(iii) the premium on the 2027 Euro notes shall not exceed a total of 0.300% if Teva has met one of the three Sustainability Performance

Targets as of the Testing Date and certified to such on or prior to the Certification Date; and

(iv) in no event shall the premium on the 2027 Euro notes exceed 0.450% of the principal amount repaid (this being the consequence of

Teva failing to achieve any of the three Sustainability Performance Targets as of the Testing Date and failing to certify to achievement on or prior to the
Certification Date).

_Reduction Target has been attained, Teva and its consolidated subsidiaries may calculate greenhouse gas emissions attributable to any single or related_
_series of acquisitions or divestitures completed since the issue date of the Euro Notes as contemplated by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol or other_
_generally accepted protocol or standard for calculating such emissions._

local infrastructure (including physical or social infrastructure or supranational, national, state, provincial or local governance)). If a Sustainability
Performance Target is not achieved as a result of the occurrence of any of the foregoing described in the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence,
as determined by Teva in its reasonable judgment, such Sustainability Performance Target will be deemed to have been achieved for purposes of the
indenture and no interest rate adjustment or premium payment shall result from the failure to achieve such Sustainability Performance Target.

“Testing Date” means December 31, 2025.

The trustee and the paying agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on an officer’s certificate from the Issuer or Teva, shall have no duty

to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any such officer’s certificate (or related Assurance Letter), verify the attainment of the Sustainability
Performance Targets, or make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to the attainment of the Sustainability Performance Targets.
The trustee and the paying agent shall have no liability to the Issuer, any holder of Euro notes or any other Person in acting in good faith on any such
officer’s certificate. The baselines (as set out in the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework and described above) used to set the Sustainability
Performance Targets have not been independently verified or audited by any third party.

**Mechanics of Payment**

Payments on the Euro notes represented by global Euro notes will be made through the principal paying agent. Payments on the Euro notes

will be made in euros at the specified office or agency of the principal paying agent; provided that all such payments with respect to Euro notes of each
series represented by one or more global Euro notes deposited with and registered in the name of the common depositary or its nominee for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream, will be by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by the holder or holders thereof
to the common depositary.

S-33


-----

**Table of Contents**

In addition, at our option, if physical Euro notes are issued, we may make payments by wire transfer to the account specified by the holder

or holders thereof as notified to the principal paying agent in writing at least 15 days prior to such payment date.

Reference to payments of interest in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, refer to the payment of interest and additional

amounts in respect to taxes or (with respect to the 2027 Euro notes) premiums, if any.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Euro notes of any series are to be redeemed at any time, the trustee or the registrar (as applicable) will select Euro

notes of such series for redemption on a pro rata basis (or based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the trustee or the
registrar deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. Neither the trustee nor
the registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

For so long as the Euro notes are listed on Euronext Dublin and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require, the Issuer shall publish a notice of

redemption in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times) and in addition to such publication, not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, mail such notice to holders of such series by electronic transmission, first-class mail,
postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the registrar. Such notice of redemption may instead be
published on the website of the Euronext Dublin.

If any note of any series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that note of such series shall state the

portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original note of such series will be issued in the name of the
holder thereof upon cancellation of the original note of such series. In the case of a global note, an appropriate notation will be made on such note of
such series to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable
redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Euro notes of any series called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Euro notes of any series or portions of them called for redemption, unless the
redemption price is not paid on the redemption date.

**Optional Redemption by the Issuer**

Subject to any adjustment in accordance with “—Premium Payment For 2027 Euro notes Upon Failure to Achieve Sustainability

Performance Targets” above, the issuer may redeem the Euro notes of any series, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, on at least 10
days’, but not more than 60 days’, prior notice delivered to the registered address of each holder of the Euro notes to be redeemed, with a copy of such
notice delivered to the trustee and the paying agent. The redemption prices will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Euro
notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) on the Euro notes being redeemed
discounted, on a semi- annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at the applicable Reinvestment Rate (as defined
below), plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any (including additional interest, if any), to, but not including, the redemption date;
provided that if the issuer redeems the Euro notes of any series on or after the applicable Par Call Date for such series, the redemption price for such
Euro notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of such Euro notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any,
to, but not including, the redemption date.

Notice of any redemption of any series of Euro notes in connection with a corporate transaction (including an equity offering, an

incurrence of indebtedness or a change of control) may, at the issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion thereof and any such redemption or
notice may, at the issuer’s

S-34


-----

**Table of Contents**

discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of the related transaction. If such redemption or
purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and such notice may be
rescinded or the redemption date delayed in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date. In addition, the
issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of its obligations with respect to such redemption may be
performed by another person.

Euro notes).

“Reference Bund” means (i) with respect to the 2027 Euro notes the 0.250% Federal Government Bond of Bundesrepublik Deutschland

due February 15, 2027, with ISIN DE0001102416 and (ii) with respect to the 2030 Euro notes the 0.000% Federal Government Bond of Bundesrepublik

mid-market semi-annual yield to maturity of the Reference Bund at 11:00 a.m. (Central European time (“CET”)) on the fourth Business Day preceding
such redemption date and if the Reference Bund is no longer outstanding, a Similar Security will be chosen by the Independent Investment Banker at
11:00 a.m. (CET) on the third Business Day in London preceding such redemption date, quoted in writing by the Independent Investment Banker to
Teva Finance II and (ii) zero.

“Remaining Scheduled Payments” means, with respect to each note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and

interest on such note as if redeemed on the applicable Par Call Date, determined at the interest rate to be applicable on such redemption date. If the
applicable redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to such note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on
such note will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued on such note to such redemption date.

“Similar Security” means a reference bond or reference bonds issued by the German Federal Government having an actual or interpolated

maturity comparable with the applicable Par Call Date of the Euro notes of such series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and
in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the applicable Par Call
Date of Euro notes of such series.

On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Euro notes or any portion of such Euro notes as is called for

redemption (unless we default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest). On or prior to the redemption date, we will deposit with the
paying agent money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Euro notes to be redeemed on such date.

The terms of the Euro notes do not prevent Teva, Teva Finance II or any of Teva’s other subsidiaries from purchasing Euro notes on the

open market.

**Certain Covenants**

_Limitations on Secured Debt. If Teva or any of its subsidiaries creates, incurs, assumes or suffers to exist any lien on any of its property_

(including a subsidiary’s stock or debt) to secure other debt, Teva will secure the Euro notes on the same basis for so long as such other debt is so
secured, unless, after giving effect to such lien, the aggregate amount of the secured debt then outstanding (not including debt secured by liens permitted
below) plus the value of all sale and leaseback transactions described in paragraph (3) of “—Limitations on Sales and Leasebacks” below would not

         - liens on property created, incurred or assumed prior to, at the time of or within 120 days after the date of acquisition, completion of
construction or completion of improvement of such property to secure all or part of the cost of acquiring, constructing or improving

         - landlord’s, material men’s, carriers’, workmen’s, repairmen’s or other like liens arising in the ordinary course of business in respect
of obligations which are not overdue or which are being contested in good faith in appropriate proceedings;

         - liens in favor of any governmental authority of any jurisdiction securing the obligation of Teva or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to
any contract or payment owed to that entity pursuant to applicable laws, regulations or statutes; and

         - any extension, renewal, substitution or replacement of the foregoing, provided that the principal amount is not increased and that
such lien is not extended to other property.

“Consolidated Net Worth” means the stockholders’ equity of the guarantor and its consolidated subsidiaries, as shown on the audited

consolidated balance sheet of the guarantor’s latest annual report to stockholders, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted

**Table of Contents**

**_Certain Other Covenants_**

The indenture will contain certain other covenants regarding, among other matters, corporate existence and reports to holders of Euro

notes.

**Additional Tax Amounts**

Neither Teva Finance II, as the issuer, nor Teva, as the guarantor, will withhold or deduct from payments made with respect to the Euro

notes on account of any present or future Taxes unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. The term “Taxing Jurisdiction” as used herein
means with respect to the Euro notes, The Netherlands, Israel or any jurisdiction where a successor to Teva Finance II or Teva is incorporated or
organized or considered to be a resident, if other than The Netherlands or Israel, respectively, or any jurisdiction through which payments will be made.

“Taxes” means, with respect to payments on the Euro notes, all taxes, withholdings, duties, assessments or governmental charges of

whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of any Taxing Jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or any authority or agency therein or
thereof having power to tax.

In the event that Teva Finance II or Teva is required to withhold or deduct on account of any such Taxes from any payment made under or

with respect to the Euro notes, Teva Finance II or Teva, as the case may be, will:

         - withhold or deduct such amounts;

         - pay such additional Tax amounts so that the net amount received by each holder or beneficial owner of the relevant Euro notes,
including those additional Tax amounts, will equal the amount that such holder or beneficial owner would have received if such
Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted; and

         - pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant tax or other authority in accordance with applicable law,

except that no such additional amounts will be payable in respect of any note:

1. to the extent that such Taxes are imposed or levied by reason of such holder (or the beneficial owner) having some present or former
connection with the Taxing Jurisdiction other than the mere holding (or beneficial ownership) of such note or receiving principal or
interest payments on the Euro notes (including but not limited to citizenship, nationality, residence, domicile, or the existence of a
business, permanent establishment, a dependent agent, a place of business or a place of management present or deemed present in
the Taxing Jurisdiction);

2. in respect of any Taxes that would not have been so withheld or deducted but for the failure by the holder or the beneficial owner of
the Euro notes to make a declaration of non-residence, or any other claim or filing for exemption to which it is entitled or otherwise
comply with any reasonable certification, identification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement concerning
nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Taxing Jurisdiction if (a) compliance is required by applicable law, regulation,
administrative practice or treaty as a precondition to exemption from all or part of the Taxes, (b) the holder (or beneficial owner) is
able to comply with these requirements without undue hardship and (c) we have given the holders (or beneficial owners) at least 30
calendar days prior notice that they will be required to comply with such requirement;

3. to the extent that such Taxes are imposed by reason of any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or personal property taxes imposed
with respect to the Euro notes, except as otherwise provided in the indenture;

S-37


-----

**Table of Contents**

4. to the extent that any such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the presentation of such Euro notes, where presentation is
required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on
which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to
additional Tax amounts had the Euro notes been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period;

5. in respect of any Taxes imposed under Sections 1471-1474 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, any applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any judicial or administrative interpretations of any of the foregoing (see “United
States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,” relating to the regime commonly known as
FATCA); or

6. any combination of items 1 through 5 above.

Teva Finance II, as the issuer, and Teva, as the guarantor, will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes or any other

excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of the Euro notes or any other
document or instrument in relation thereto.

**_Tax Redemption_**

The Euro notes of any series may be redeemed as a whole, but not in part, at the option of Teva Finance II, Teva or any successor to Teva

Finance II or Teva, as the case may be, at any time prior to maturity, upon the giving of not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ notice of tax
redemption to the trustee and the holders of the applicable series of Euro notes, if Teva Finance II or Teva determines that, as a result of:

         - any change in or amendment to the laws, or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws of the Taxing Jurisdiction or any
political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the Taxing Jurisdiction affecting taxation, or

         - any change in official position regarding the application or interpretation of the laws, regulations or rulings referred to above,

which change or amendment becomes effective or, in the case of a change in official position, is announced on or after the issuance of Euro notes, Teva
Finance II, Teva or any successor to Teva Finance II or Teva, as the case may be, is or will become obligated to pay additional tax amounts with respect
to the Euro notes, as described above under “—Additional Tax Amounts,” provided that Teva Finance II or Teva (or any of their respective successors)
determines that such obligation cannot be avoided by Teva Finance II or Teva (or any of their respective successors), as the case may be, taking
reasonable measures available to it.

The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of Euro notes plus accrued and unpaid interest,

if any, to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. The date and the applicable redemption price will be specified in the notice of tax
redemption, which notice will be given not earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which Teva Finance II (or its successor) or, as the case may
be, Teva (or its successor) would be obligated to pay such additional tax amounts if a payment in respect of the relevant Euro notes were actually due on
such date. The Euro notes can be redeemed if, at the time such notice of redemption is given, such obligation to pay such additional tax amounts remains
in effect.

Prior to giving the notice of a tax redemption, Teva Finance II, Teva or any successor to Teva Finance II or Teva, as the case may be, will

deliver to the trustee:

         - a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer stating that Teva Finance II, Teva or any successor to Teva Finance II or Teva, as the
case may be, is entitled to effect the redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the
right of Teva Finance II, Teva or any successor to Teva Finance II or Teva, as the case may be, to so redeem have occurred; and

         - an opinion of independent legal counsel of recognized standing to that effect based on the statement of facts.

See “Dutch Tax Considerations” for additional information on potential Dutch withholding taxes in respect of interest payments on the

Euro notes.

**Events of Default**

_Each of the following constitutes an event of default under the indenture with respect to each series of Euro notes:_

(i) Teva Finance II’s failure to pay when due the principal and premium, if any, on such series of Euro notes issued under the indenture
at maturity or upon redemption;

(ii) Teva Finance II’s failure to pay an installment of interest (including additional amounts, if any) on such series of Euro notes issued
under the indenture for 30 days after the date when due;

(iii) Teva’s failure to perform its obligations under its guarantee under the indenture relating to such series of Euro notes;

(iv) except as permitted by the indenture, the related guarantee by Teva shall be held in any final, non-appealable judicial proceeding to
be unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any reason to be in full force and effect or Teva, or any person acting on behalf of
Teva, shall deny or disaffirm its obligations under that guarantee;

(v) Teva’s or Teva Finance II’s failure to perform or observe any other term, covenant or agreement contained in the indenture or the
relevant Euro notes issued under it for a period of 60 days after written notice of such failure, requiring Teva or Teva Finance II, as
the case may be, to remedy the same, shall have been given to Teva or Teva Finance II, as the case may be, by the trustee or to Teva
or Teva Finance II, as the case may be, and the trustee by the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of such series of
Euro notes then outstanding (provided that such notice may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to
holders of such series of Euro notes, more than two years prior to such notice; provided further that the trustee shall have no
obligation to determine when or if any holders have been notified of any such action or to track when such two-year period starts or
concludes);

(vi) Teva’s or Teva Finance II’s default under any Indebtedness (as defined below) for money borrowed by it, the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of which is in an amount in excess of $250 million, for a period of 30 days after written notice to Teva Finance II
by the trustee or to Teva Finance II and the trustee by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the relevant Euro
notes then outstanding, which default:

             - is caused by Teva or Teva Finance II’s, as the case may be, failure to pay when due principal or interest on such
Indebtedness by the end of the applicable grace period, if any, unless such Indebtedness is discharged; or

             - results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness, unless such acceleration is waived, cured, rescinded or annulled; and

(vii) Teva or Teva Finance II’s bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization.

For the avoidance of doubt, failure to achieve one or more Sustainability Performance Targets shall not constitute a default or an event of

default with respect to the Euro notes.

The indenture will provide that the trustee shall (other than in the case of (vii) above, which shall result in the Euro notes of a series

becoming immediately due and payable), within 90 days of the occurrence of a

S-39


-----

**Table of Contents**

default under the indenture, give to the registered holders of the Euro notes of such series notice of all defaults that have occurred and are continuing
known to it, but the trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if it, in good faith, determines that the withholding of such notice is in the best
interest of such registered holders, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on, any of the Euro notes when due or in
the payment of any redemption or repurchase obligation.

If an event of default under the indenture shall occur and be continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal

amount of the Euro notes of such series affected then outstanding may declare the principal amount of such series of Euro notes due and payable,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and then the trustee may, at its discretion, proceed to protect and enforce the rights of the holders of
such series of Euro notes by appropriate judicial proceedings. Such declaration may be rescinded or annulled with the written consent of the holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of such series of Euro notes then outstanding. Any time period in the indenture or the Euro notes to cure any
actual or alleged default or event of default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

The indenture will contain a provision entitling the trustee, subject to the duty of the trustee during default to act with the required standard

of care, to be indemnified to its satisfaction by the holders of the Euro notes before proceeding to exercise any right or power under the indenture at the
request of such holders. The indenture will provide that, subject to the conditions set forth therein, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Euro notes of a series then outstanding shall have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series of Euro notes by the indenture.
Teva Finance II will be required to furnish annually to the trustee a statement as to its compliance with all conditions and covenants under the indenture.

“Indebtedness” means, with respect to any person:

(i) any liability for borrowed money, or evidenced by an instrument for the payment of money, or incurred in connection with the
acquisition of any property, services or assets (including securities), or relating to a capitalized lease obligation, other than accounts
payable or any other indebtedness to trade creditors created or assumed by such person in the ordinary course of business in
connection with the obtaining of materials or services;

(ii) obligations under exchange rate contracts or interest rate protection agreements;

(iii) any obligations to reimburse Teva Finance II of any letter of credit, surety bond, performance bond or other guarantee of contractual
performance;

(iv) any liability of another person of the type referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) which has been assumed or guaranteed by such person;
and

(v) any obligations described in clauses (i) through (iii) secured by any mortgage, pledge, lien or other encumbrance existing on
property which is owned or held by such person, regardless of whether the indebtedness or other obligation secured thereby shall
have been assumed by such person.

**_Consolidation, Merger or Assumption_**

Teva Finance II may, without the consent of the holders of the Euro notes, consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or substantially all of

its respective assets to any other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, association, joint stock company or trust organized
under the laws of The Netherlands, in the case of Teva Finance II, provided that:

         - the successor entity assumes all of the obligations of Teva Finance II under the indenture and the Euro notes; and

S-40

**Table of Contents**

         - at the time of such transaction, no event of default, and no event which, after notice or lapse of time, would become an event of
default, shall have happened and be continuing.

Under the terms of the indenture, Teva may, without the consent of the holders of Euro notes, consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or

substantially all of its assets to any other corporation provided that:

         - the successor corporation assumes all of the obligations of Teva under the indenture and the Euro notes; and

         - at the time of such transaction, no event of default, and no event which, after notice or lapse of time, would become an event of
default, shall have happened and be continuing.

The indenture will provide that so long as any Euro notes are outstanding, all of Teva Finance II’s capital stock or membership interests, as

applicable, will be owned directly or indirectly by Teva or its successor.

**Modifications and Amendments**

**_Changes Requiring Approval of Each Affected Holder_**

The indenture will provide that it cannot be modified or amended without the written consent or the affirmative vote of the holder of each

note affected by such change to:

         - change the maturity of the principal of or any installment of interest on such note;

         - reduce the principal amount of or interest on such note;

         - change the currency of payment of that note or interest thereon;

         - impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such note;

         - modify Teva’s obligation to own, directly or indirectly, all of Teva Finance II’s outstanding capital stock or membership interests, as

indenture or to waive any past default; or

         - reduce the percentage in aggregate principal amount of Euro notes of a series outstanding required for the adoption of a resolution.

**_Changes Requiring Majority Approval_**

Except as described above, the indenture may be modified or amended with the written consent of the holders of at least a majority in

aggregate principal amount of Securities affected at the time outstanding (voting as one class). Therefore, amendments to provisions contained in the
base indenture will require the requisite vote of the Securities outstanding thereunder (including the Euro notes offered hereby), while amendments to
provisions contained in the third supplemental indenture will require the requisite vote of the Euro notes of such series offered hereby.

**_Changes Requiring No Approval_**

The indenture or the Euro notes may be modified or amended by Teva Finance II, Teva and the trustee, without the consent of the holder of

any note, for the purposes of, among other things:

         - securing any series of Euro notes or confirming and evidencing the release of security when such security is not required under the
indenture;

S-41

affect the interests of the holders of Euro notes in any material respect; and provided, further, that any amendment made solely to
conform the provisions of the indenture to the description of the Euro notes contained in this prospectus supplement will not be
deemed to adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Euro notes;

         - evidencing the assumption by Teva (or any successor) of all obligations and release of the issuer; provided that no event of default
under the indenture shall have occurred and be continuing;

         - evidencing the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee;

         - adding guarantors or co-obligors to a series or releasing guarantors in accordance with the indenture; or

desirable and which will not adversely affect the interests of the holders of Euro notes.

**_Satisfaction and Discharge_**

Teva Finance II and Teva may satisfy and discharge their obligations under the indenture with respect to any Euro notes while the Euro

notes remain outstanding if:

         - all outstanding Euro notes with respect to such series issued under the indenture have become due and payable at their scheduled
maturity; or

         - all outstanding Euro notes issued under the indenture with respect to such series have been called for redemption,

and, in either case, Teva Finance II has deposited with the trustee an amount sufficient to pay and discharge all outstanding Euro notes issued under the
indenture on the date of their scheduled maturity or the scheduled date of redemption, as the case may be.

**_Governing Law_**

The indenture and the Euro notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.

**_Information Concerning the Trustee and Paying Agent_**

The Bank of New York Mellon has been appointed by us as trustee, transfer agent and registrar with regard to the Euro notes of each

series. The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, has been appointed by us as the paying agent with respect to the Euro notes and will act as
common depositary. The Bank of New York Mellon, The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch or their affiliates may from time to time in the
future provide banking and other services to us in the ordinary course of their business. The Bank of New York Mellon

S-42


-----

**Table of Contents**

and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the trusts or powers vested in them by the indenture
at the request, order or direction of any of the holders of the Euro notes of a series pursuant to the indenture, unless such holders shall have offered to the
trustee and the paying agent security or indemnity satisfactory to them against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred therein or
thereby.

**_Provisions Relating To The Euro notes While Represented By The Global Euro notes_**

**_General_**

The Euro notes issued on the closing date will be issued in the form of global Euro notes in fully registered form without coupons

representing the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Euro notes. Each global note will be deposited with and registered in the name of a
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream or a nominee thereof.

Book-entry interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through

such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the global Euro notes or depositary interest therein on behalf of their participants
through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries.

Except under the limited circumstances described below under “—Physical Euro notes,” owners of book-entry interests will not be entitled

to receive physical delivery of the Euro notes. Instead, book-entry interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. As long as the Euro notes are held in global form, the common
depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its nominee) will be considered the sole holder of global Euro notes for all purposes under the indenture.
As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of the participants
through which they own book-entry interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the indenture. The laws of some jurisdictions may require
that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own,
transfer or pledge book-entry interests. In addition, while the Euro notes are in global form, owners of interest in the global note will not have Euro
notes registered in their names and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose.

Teva Finance II will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Euro notes; however, holders of the book-entry interests may

incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

Neither the trustee nor any of its agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the book-entry

interests.

The information below concerning Euroclear and Clearstream has been derived from information obtained from Euroclear and

Clearstream and other sources. None of Teva Finance II, Teva or the managers (or any person acting on their behalf) makes any representation or
warranty regarding the accuracy or completeness thereof.

**Physical Euro notes**

Under the terms of the indenture, owners of book-entry interests will receive Euro notes in definitive form (the “physical Euro notes”) only

in the following circumstances:

(1) Euroclear or Clearstream notifies Teva Finance II in writing that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary for the Euro

notes, or Euroclear or Clearstream ceases to be a “clearing agency” registered under the Exchange Act and a successor depositary for the global note is
not appointed by Teva Finance II within 90 days of such notice or cessation; or

S-43


-----

**Table of Contents**

(2) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the registrar has received a request from Euroclear or Clearstream on behalf of

the members of, or participants in, Euroclear or Clearstream for the issuance of physical Euro notes in exchange for the global note.

In such an event, Teva Finance II will issue physical Euro notes in fully registered form without coupons in the name or names and issued

in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respectively
customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of book-entry interests), and such
physical Euro notes will bear a restrictive legend with respect to certain transfer restrictions, unless that legend is not required by the indenture or
applicable law.

**Payments on Global Euro notes**

Payments of any amounts (including principal, premium interest and additional amounts) on the global Euro notes will be made through

the principal paying agent. Payments on the Euro notes will be made in euros at the specified office or agency of the principal paying agent; provided
that all such payments with respect to Euro notes represented by one or more global Euro notes deposited with and registered in the name of the
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee will be by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in
writing by the holder or holders thereof to the common depositary. The principal paying agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream. Such payments will then be distributed to participants of Euroclear and Clearstream in accordance with the
relevant system’s procedures.

In addition, at our option, if physical Euro notes are issued, we may make payments by wire transfer to the account specified by the holder

or holders thereof as notified to the principal paying agent in writing at least 15 days prior to such payment date.

Under the terms of the indenture, each of Teva Finance II, Teva, the trustee and any agents of the foregoing (including the principal paying

agent) will treat the registered holder of the global Euro notes (e.g., the common depositary or its nominee) as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose
of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of Teva Finance II, Teva, the trustee or any of their respective agents has or will
have any responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of

a book-entry interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participants, or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing any of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a bookentry interest; or

(2) Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of book-entry interests held through participants are the responsibility of such participants, as is now

the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in “street name.”

**Redemption of Global Note**

In the event a global note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, payment of all amounts in respect of the redemption will be made through

the principal paying agent in the manner described above. Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will distribute the amount received by them in
respect of the global note so redeemed to the holders of the book-entry interests in such global note. Teva understands that under existing practices of
Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Euro notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and

S-44


-----

**Table of Contents**

Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as
they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no book-entry interest of less than €1,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised Teva that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder (including the presentation of

Euro notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the book-entry interests in any global
note are credited and only in respect of such portion to the aggregate principal amount of Euro notes as to which such participant or participants has or
have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other
action in respect of such global note. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Euro notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserve the right
to exchange the global Euro notes for physical Euro notes, and to distribute such physical Euro notes to its participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

**_Initial Settlement_**

Book-entry interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional

eurobonds in registered form. Book-entry interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the
business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**_Secondary Market Trading_**

The book-entry interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase

determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any book-entry interests where both the purchaser’s and seller’s
accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

We understand the following with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

         - Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for their respective participating organizations and facilitate the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such
participants;

         - Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and
settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing;

         - Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets;

         - Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as managers, underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations; and

         - Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear
through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

**Custody Risks**

Investors that acquire, hold and transfer interests in the Euro notes by book-entry through accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or

any other securities intermediary are subject to the laws and contractual

S-45


-----

**Table of Contents**

provisions governing their relationship with their intermediary, as well as the laws and contractual provisions governing the relationship between such
an intermediary and each other intermediary, if any, standing between themselves and the individual securities.

**Procedures Subject to Change**

Although Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to these procedures in order to facilitate transfers of securities among Euroclear and

Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform these procedures and these procedures may be discontinued and may be
changed at any time by either of them.

The indenture does not contain any financial covenants or restrictions on the amount of additional indebtedness that Teva, Teva Finance III

or any of Teva’s other subsidiaries may incur except as described in “—Certain Covenants” below. The indenture does not protect you in the event of a
highly leveraged transaction or change of control of Teva or Teva Finance III. The indenture does not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or
payment of a consent fee to holders. The USD notes do not contain any sinking fund provisions. Following consummation of the offering and
application of the proceeds therefrom, $5,210 million of Securities (as defined in the base indenture) will be outstanding under the indenture, and
holders of such Securities, including the holders of the USD notes, will vote together as a single class with respect to certain matters thereunder.

Teva Finance III may, without the consent of the holders, issue additional USD notes of any series under the indenture with the same terms

(except for the issue date, issue price and, in some cases, the first payment of interest or interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional USD
notes) and with the same CUSIP number as the USD notes of such series offered hereby in an unlimited aggregate principal amount; provided that if the
additional USD notes of a series are not fungible with the USD notes of such series for United States federal income tax purposes, such additional USD
notes will have a separate CUSIP number. We may also from time to time repurchase USD notes in open market purchases or negotiated transactions
without giving prior notice to holders.

You may present definitive registered USD notes for registration of transfer and exchange, without service charge, at our office or agency

in New York City, which shall initially be the office or agency of the trustee in New York City. For information regarding registration of transfer and

trustee, the holders of the applicable USD notes and their successors, transferees and assigns. Teva will also guarantee the Euro notes issued in this
offering.

Each guarantee will be an unsecured senior obligation of Teva. As indebtedness of Teva, after giving effect to the offerings contemplated

hereby, each guarantee will rank:

     - senior to the rights of creditors under indebtedness expressly subordinated to the guarantee (at September 30, 2021, Teva had no
subordinated indebtedness outstanding);

     - equally with other unsecured indebtedness of Teva from time to time outstanding other than any that is subordinated to the guarantee (at
September 30, 2021, Teva had approximately $23.5 billion of senior unsecured indebtedness outstanding);

     - effectively junior to Teva’s secured indebtedness up to the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness (at September 30, 2021, Teva
had no secured indebtedness outstanding); and

     - effectively junior to the indebtedness and other liabilities of Teva’s subsidiaries (other than the issuer) (at September 30, 2021, Teva’s
subsidiaries, other than finance subsidiaries, had a de minimis amount of indebtedness outstanding).

**Payment of Interest, Premium and Principal**

**_Interest on the USD notes_**

Subject to any adjustment in accordance with “ Interest Rate Adjustment For 2029 USD notes Upon Failure to Achieve Sustainability

Performance Targets” below, the 2027 USD notes and the 2029 USD notes will bear interest at the rate of 4.750% per year and 5.125% per year,
respectively, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 9 and November 9 of each year, beginning May 9, 2022, to the holders of record at the close of
business on the preceding May 1 and November 1, respectively, whether or not a Business Day (as defined below). If an interest payment date for the
USD notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, interest will be payable on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if
made on such interest payment date and no interest shall accrue thereon on account of such delay. Interest on the USD notes will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months, and will accrue from November 9, 2021, or from the most recent interest payment date to
which interest has been paid to, but not including, the next interest payment date.

“Business Day” means a day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday, (ii) a day on which banks in New York, New York are authorized or

obligated by law or executive order to remain closed or (iii) a day on which the trustee’s corporate trust office is closed for business.

**_Interest Rate Adjustment For 2029 USD notes Upon Failure to Achieve Sustainability Performance Targets_**

From and including May 9, 2026 (the “Step-up Date”), the interest rate payable on the 2029 USD notes (but not the 2027 USD notes) shall

increase by:

(a) 0.125% per annum unless Teva has achieved the Regulatory Submissions Target as of the Testing Date;

(b) 0.125% per annum unless Teva has achieved the Product Volume Target as of the Testing Date; and

(c) 0.125% per annum unless Teva has achieved the Emission Reduction Target as of the Testing Date;

in each case, as certified by the Issuer or Teva to the trustee in an officer’s certificate (which shall include the Assurance Letter as an exhibit thereto) on
or prior to the Certification Date (subject to any clerical or administrative errors (including any delays resulting therefrom)); provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt:

(i) the interest rate on the 2029 USD notes shall not increase on the Step-up Date if Teva has achieved the three Sustainability Performance

Targets as of the Testing Date and certified to such on or prior to the Certification Date;

(ii) the increase in the interest rate on the 2029 USD notes on the Step-up Date shall not exceed a total of 0.125% if Teva has achieved two

of the three Sustainability Performance Targets as of the Testing Date and certified to such on or prior to the Certification Date;

(iii) the increase in the interest rate on the 2029 USD notes on the Step-up Date shall not exceed a total of 0.250% if Teva has met one of

the three Sustainability Performance Targets as of the Testing Date and certified to such on or prior to the Certification Date; and

(iv) in no event shall the total increase in the interest rate on the 2029 USD notes on the Step-up Date exceed 0.375% (this being the

consequence of Teva failing to achieve any of the three Sustainability Performance Targets on the Testing Date and failing to certify to achievement on
or prior to the Certification Date).

in each case, as certified by the Issuer or Teva to the trustee in an officer’s certificate (which shall include the Assurance Letter as an exhibit thereto) on
or prior to the Certification Date (subject to any clerical or administrative errors (including any delays resulting therefrom)); provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt:

(i) no premium shall be payable on the 2027 USD notes if Teva has achieved the three Sustainability Performance Targets as of the Testing

Date and certified to such on or prior to the Certification Date;

(ii) the premium on the 2027 USD notes shall not exceed a total of 0.150% of the principal amount repaid if Teva has achieved two of the

Targets as of the Testing Date and certified to such on or prior to the Certification Date; and

(iv) in no event shall the premium on the 2027 USD notes exceed 0.450% of the principal amount repaid (this being the consequence of

Teva failing to achieve any of the three Sustainability Performance Targets as of the Testing Date and failing to certify to achievement on or prior to the

**Table of Contents**

     - any definitive registered USD notes at our office or agency in New York City, which initially will be the office or agency of the trustee in
New York City.

Reference to payments of interest in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, refer to the payment of interest and additional

amounts in respect to taxes or (with respect to the 2027 Dollar notes) premiums, if any.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the USD notes of any series are to be redeemed at any time, the trustee or the registrar (as applicable) will select USD

notes of such series for redemption on a pro rata basis (or based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the trustee or the
registrar deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. Neither the trustee nor
the registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

The Issuer shall, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, mail a notice of redemption to holders of such series

by electronic transmission, first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the registrar.

If any note of any series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that note of such series shall state the

portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original note of such series will be issued in the name of the
holder thereof upon cancellation of the original note of such series. In the case of a global note, an appropriate notation will be made on such note of
such series to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable
redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), USD notes of any series called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on USD notes of any series or portions of them called for redemption, unless the
redemption price is not paid on the redemption date.

**Optional Redemption by the Issuer**

Subject to any adjustment in accordance with “ —Premium Payment For 2027 USD notes Upon Failure to Achieve Sustainability

Performance Targets” above, the issuer may redeem the USD notes of any series, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, on at least 10
days’, but not more than 60 days’, prior notice delivered to the registered address of each holder of the USD notes to be redeemed, with a copy of such
notice delivered to the trustee. The redemption prices will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the USD notes to be redeemed
or (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) on the USD notes being redeemed discounted, on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), using a discount rate equal to the sum of the Treasury Rate (as defined
below) plus 50 basis points, in the case of the 2027 USD notes, and 50 basis points, in the case of the 2029 USD notes, plus in each case accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date; provided that if the issuer redeems the USD notes of any series on or after the
applicable Par Call Date for such series, the redemption price for such USD notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of such USD
notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.

Notice of any redemption of any series of USD notes in connection with a corporate transaction (including an equity offering, an

incurrence of indebtedness or a change of control) may, at the issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion thereof and any such redemption or
notice may, at the issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of the related transaction.
If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and such
notice may be rescinded or the redemption date delayed in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date.
In addition, the issuer

S-52

**Table of Contents**

may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of its obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed
by another person.

“Comparable Treasury Issue” means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a

maturity comparable to the remaining term to the Par Call Date of the applicable series of USD notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time
of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the
remaining term to the Par Call Date of such series of USD notes.

“Comparable Treasury Price” means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for

such redemption date after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker
obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.

“Independent Investment Banker” means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by us.

“Par Call Date” means (i) with respect to the 2027 USD notes February 9, 2027 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date of

the 2027 USD notes) and (ii) with respect to the 2029 USD notes February 9, 2029 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date of the 2029
USD notes).

“Reference Treasury Dealer” means each of BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., HSBC Bank plc and J.P. Morgan

Securities plc and their respective successors. If any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer or is unable or unwilling to provide
such services, we will substitute another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a Primary Treasury Dealer.

“Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations” means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as

determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a
percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York
City time, on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.

“Remaining Scheduled Payments” means, with respect to each note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and

interest on such note as if redeemed on the applicable Par Call Date, determined at the interest rate to be applicable on such redemption date. If the
applicable redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to such note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on
such note will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued on such note to such redemption date.

“Treasury Rate” means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity

(computed as of the second Business Day immediately preceding such redemption date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the
Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.

On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the USD notes or any portion of such USD notes as is called for

redemption (unless we default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest). On or prior to the redemption date, we will deposit with a
paying agent (or the trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the USD notes to be redeemed on such date.

The terms of the USD notes do not prevent Teva, Teva Finance III or any of Teva’s other subsidiaries from purchasing USD notes on the

open market.

**Certain Covenants**

the USD notes on the same basis for so long as such other debt is so secured, unless, after giving effect to such lien, the aggregate amount of the secured
debt then outstanding (not including debt secured by liens permitted below) plus the value of all sale and leaseback transactions described in paragraph

     - liens securing debt owing by a subsidiary to Teva or to one or more of its subsidiaries;

     - liens in favor of any governmental authority of any jurisdiction securing the obligation of Teva or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to any

     - any extension, renewal, substitution or replacement of the foregoing, provided that the principal amount is not increased and that such lien
is not extended to other property.

“Consolidated Net Worth” means the stockholders’ equity of the guarantor and its consolidated subsidiaries, as shown on the audited

consolidated balance sheet of the guarantor’s latest annual report to stockholders, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

_Limitations on Sales and Leasebacks. Teva will not, and will not permit any subsidiary to, enter into any sale and leaseback transaction_

covering any property after the date when Teva Finance III first issues the USD notes pursuant to the indenture unless:

**Additional Tax Amounts**

Neither Teva Finance III, as the issuer, nor Teva, as the guarantor, will withhold or deduct from payments made with respect to the USD

notes on account of any present or future Taxes unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. The term “Taxing Jurisdiction” as used herein
means with respect to the USD notes, The Netherlands, Israel or any jurisdiction where a successor to Teva Finance III or Teva is incorporated or
organized or considered to be a resident, if other than The Netherlands or Israel, respectively, or any jurisdiction through which payments will be made.

“Taxes” means, with respect to payments on the USD notes, all taxes, withholdings, duties, assessments or governmental charges of

whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of any Taxing Jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or any authority or agency therein or
thereof having power to tax.

In the event that Teva Finance III or Teva is required to withhold or deduct on account of any such Taxes from any payment made under or

with respect to the USD notes, Teva Finance III or Teva, as the case may be, will:

     - withhold or deduct such amounts;

     - pay such additional Tax amounts so that the net amount received by each holder or beneficial owner of the relevant USD notes, including
those additional Tax amounts, will equal the amount that such holder or beneficial owner would have received if such Taxes had not been
required to be withheld or deducted; and

     - pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant tax or other authority in accordance with applicable law,

except that no such additional amounts will be payable in respect of any note:

1. to the extent that such Taxes are imposed or levied by reason of such holder (or the beneficial owner) having some present or former
connection with the Taxing Jurisdiction other than the mere holding (or beneficial ownership) of such note or receiving principal or
interest payments on the USD notes (including but not limited to citizenship, nationality, residence, domicile, or the existence of a
business, permanent establishment, a dependent agent, a place of business or a place of management present or deemed present in
the Taxing Jurisdiction);

2. in respect of any Taxes that would not have been so withheld or deducted but for the failure by the holder or the beneficial owner of
the USD notes to make a declaration of non-residence, or any other claim or filing for exemption to which it is entitled or otherwise
comply with any reasonable certification, identification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement concerning
nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Taxing Jurisdiction if (a) compliance is required by applicable law, regulation,
administrative practice or treaty as a precondition to exemption from all or part of the Taxes, (b) the holder (or beneficial owner) is
able to comply with these requirements without undue hardship and (c) we have given the holders (or beneficial owners) at least 30
calendar days prior notice that they will be required to comply with such requirement;

3. to the extent that such Taxes are imposed by reason of any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or personal property taxes imposed
with respect to the USD notes, except as otherwise provided in the indenture;

4. to the extent that any such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the presentation of such USD notes, where presentation is
required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on
which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to
additional Tax amounts had the USD notes been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period;

S-55


-----

**Table of Contents**

5. in respect of any Taxes imposed under Sections 1471-1474 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, any applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any judicial or administrative interpretations of any of the foregoing (see “United
States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,” relating to the regime commonly known as
FATCA); or

6. any combination of items 1 through 5 above.

Teva Finance III, as the issuer, and Teva, as the guarantor, will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes or any other

excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of the USD notes or any other
document or instrument in relation thereto.

**Tax Redemption**

The USD notes of any series may be redeemed as a whole, but not in part, at the option of Teva Finance III, Teva or any successor to Teva

Finance III or Teva, as the case may be, at any time prior to maturity, upon the giving of not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ notice of tax
redemption to the trustee and the holders of the applicable series of USD notes, if Teva Finance III or Teva determines that, as a result of:

     - any change in or amendment to the laws, or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws of the Taxing Jurisdiction or any
political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the Taxing Jurisdiction affecting taxation, or

     - any change in official position regarding the application or interpretation of the laws, regulations or rulings referred to above,

which change or amendment becomes effective or, in the case of a change in official position, is announced on or after the issuance of USD notes, Teva
Finance III, Teva or any successor to Teva Finance III or Teva, as the case may be, is or will become obligated to pay additional tax amounts with
respect to the USD notes, as described above under “—Additional Tax Amounts,” provided that Teva Finance III or Teva (or any of their respective
successors) determines that such obligation cannot be avoided by Teva Finance III or Teva (or any of their respective successors), as the case may be,
taking reasonable measures available to it.

The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of USD notes plus accrued and unpaid

interest, if any, to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. The date and the applicable redemption price will be specified in the notice of tax
redemption, which notice will be given not earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which Teva Finance III (or its successor) or, as the case may
be, Teva (or its successor) would be obligated to pay such additional tax amounts if a payment in respect of the relevant USD notes were actually due on
such date. The USD notes can be redeemed if, at the time such notice of redemption is given, such obligation to pay such additional tax amounts
remains in effect.

Prior to giving the notice of a tax redemption, Teva Finance III, Teva or any successor to Teva Finance III or Teva, as the case may be, will

deliver to the trustee:

     - a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer stating that Teva Finance III, Teva or any successor to Teva Finance III or Teva, as the case
may be, is entitled to effect the redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of Teva
Finance III, Teva or any successor to Teva Finance III or Teva, as the case may be, to so redeem have occurred; and

     - an opinion of independent legal counsel of recognized standing to that effect based on the statement of facts.

See “Dutch Tax Considerations” for additional information on potential Dutch withholding taxes in respect of interest payments on the

USD notes.

**Table of Contents**

**Events of Default**

_Each of the following constitutes an event of default under the indenture with respect to each series of USD notes:_

(i) Teva Finance III’s failure to pay when due the principal and premium, if any, on such series of USD notes issued under the indenture
at maturity or upon redemption;

(ii) Teva Finance III’s failure to pay an installment of interest (including additional amounts, if any) on such series of USD notes issued
under the indenture for 30 days after the date when due;

(iii) Teva’s failure to perform its obligations under its guarantee under the indenture relating to such series of USD notes;

(iv) except as permitted by the indenture, the related guarantee by Teva shall be held in any final, non-appealable judicial proceeding to
be unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any reason to be in full force and effect or Teva, or any person acting on behalf of
Teva, shall deny or disaffirm its obligations under that guarantee;

(v) Teva’s or Teva Finance III’s failure to perform or observe any other term, covenant or agreement contained in the indenture or the
relevant USD notes issued under it for a period of 60 days after written notice of such failure, requiring Teva or Teva Finance III, as
the case may be, to remedy the same, shall have been given to Teva or Teva Finance III, as the case may be, by the trustee or to Teva
or Teva Finance III, as the case may be, and the trustee by the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of such series of
USD notes then outstanding (provided that such notice may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to
holders of such series of USD notes, more than two years prior to such notice; provided further that the trustee shall have no
obligation to determine when or if any holders have been notified of any such action or to track when such two-year period starts or
concludes);

(vi) Teva’s or Teva Finance III’s default under any Indebtedness (as defined below) for money borrowed by it, the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of which is in an amount in excess of $250 million, for a period of 30 days after written notice to Teva Finance III
by the trustee or to Teva Finance III and the trustee by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the relevant USD
notes then outstanding, which default:

             - is caused by Teva or Teva Finance III’s, as the case may be, failure to pay when due principal or interest on such
Indebtedness by the end of the applicable grace period, if any, unless such Indebtedness is discharged; or

             - results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness, unless such acceleration is waived, cured, rescinded or annulled; and

(vii) Teva or Teva Finance III’s bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization.

For the avoidance of doubt, failure to achieve one or more Sustainability Performance Targets shall not constitute a default or an event of

default with respect to the USD notes.

The indenture will provide that the trustee shall (other than in the case of (vii) above, which shall result in the USD notes of a series

becoming immediately due and payable), within 90 days of the occurrence of a default under the indenture, give to the registered holders of the USD
notes of such series notice of all defaults that have occurred and are continuing known to it, but the trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice
if it, in good faith, determines that the withholding of such notice is in the best interest of such registered holders, except in the case of a default in the
payment of the principal of or interest on, any of the USD notes when due or in the payment of any redemption or repurchase obligation.

If an event of default under the indenture shall occur and be continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal

amount of the USD notes of such series affected then outstanding may declare

S-57


-----

**Table of Contents**

the principal amount of such series of USD notes due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and then the trustee may, at its
discretion, proceed to protect and enforce the rights of the holders of such series of USD notes by appropriate judicial proceedings. Such declaration
may be rescinded or annulled with the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such series of USD notes then
outstanding. Any time period in the indenture or the USD notes to cure any actual or alleged default or event of default may be extended or stayed by a
court of competent jurisdiction.

The indenture will contain a provision entitling the trustee, subject to the duty of the trustee during default to act with the required standard

of care, to be indemnified to its satisfaction by the holders of the USD notes before proceeding to exercise any right or power under the indenture at the
request of such holders. The indenture will provide that, subject to the conditions set forth therein, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the USD notes of a series then outstanding shall have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series of USD notes by the indenture.

Teva Finance III will be required to furnish annually to the trustee a statement as to its compliance with all conditions and covenants under

the indenture.

“Indebtedness” means, with respect to any person:

(i) any liability for borrowed money, or evidenced by an instrument for the payment of money, or incurred in connection with the
acquisition of any property, services or assets (including securities), or relating to a capitalized lease obligation, other than accounts
payable or any other indebtedness to trade creditors created or assumed by such person in the ordinary course of business in
connection with the obtaining of materials or services;

(ii) obligations under exchange rate contracts or interest rate protection agreements;

(iii) any obligations to reimburse Teva Finance III of any letter of credit, surety bond, performance bond or other guarantee of contractual
performance;

(iv) any liability of another person of the type referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) which has been assumed or guaranteed by such person;
and

(v) any obligations described in clauses (i) through (iii) secured by any mortgage, pledge, lien or other encumbrance existing on
property which is owned or held by such person, regardless of whether the indebtedness or other obligation secured thereby shall
have been assumed by such person.

**Consolidation, Merger or Assumption**

Teva Finance III may, without the consent of the holders of the USD notes, consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or substantially all

of its respective assets to any other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, association, joint stock company or trust organized
under the laws of The Netherlands, in the case of Teva Finance III, provided that:

     - the successor entity assumes all of the obligations of Teva Finance III under the indenture and the USD notes; and

     - at the time of such transaction, no event of default, and no event which, after notice or lapse of time, would become an event of default,
shall have happened and be continuing.

Under the terms of the indenture, Teva may, without the consent of the holders of USD notes, consolidate with, merge into or transfer all

or substantially all of its assets to any other corporation, provided that:

     - the successor corporation assumes all of the obligations of Teva under the indenture and the USD notes; and

     - at the time of such transaction, no event of default, and no event which, after notice or lapse of time, would become an event of default,
shall have happened and be continuing.

Finance III’s managing and supervisory directors, adversely affect the interests of the holders of USD notes in any material respect; and

**_Satisfaction and Discharge_**

Teva Finance III and Teva may satisfy and discharge their obligations under the indenture with respect to any USD notes while the USD

notes remain outstanding if:

     - all outstanding USD notes with respect to such series issued under the indenture have become due and payable at their scheduled maturity;
or

     - all outstanding USD notes issued under the indenture with respect to such series have been called for redemption,

and, in either case, Teva Finance III has deposited with the trustee an amount sufficient to pay and discharge all outstanding USD notes issued under the
indenture on the date of their scheduled maturity or the scheduled date of redemption, as the case may be.

**Governing Law**

The indenture and the USD notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.

**Information Concerning the Trustee and Paying Agent**

The Bank of New York Mellon has been appointed by us as trustee, paying agent, transfer agent, registrar and custodian with regard to the

USD notes of each series. The Bank of New York Mellon or its affiliates may from time to time in the future provide banking and other services to us in
the ordinary course of their business. The Bank of New York Mellon shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the trusts or powers vested in it by
the indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the holders of the USD notes of a series pursuant to the indenture, unless such holders shall have
offered to the trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred therein or thereby.

**Form, Denomination and Registration**

**_Denomination and Registration. The USD notes of each series will be issued in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations_**

of $200,000 principal amount and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess of $200,000.

**_Global USD notes; Book-Entry Form. The USD notes will be represented by permanent global USD notes in definitive, fully registered_**

form without interest coupons. The global registered USD notes will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of a
nominee of DTC in New York, New York for the accounts of participants in DTC.

**Table of Contents**

Except as set forth below, the global registered USD notes will be transferable, in whole or in part, only to another nominee of DTC or to a

successor of DTC or its nominee.

DTC has advised us that it is:

         - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York;

         - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

         - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

         - a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”).

DTC was created to hold securities of institutions that have accounts with DTC and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities

transactions among its participants in securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the participants, thereby eliminating the need for
physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s participants include:

         - securities brokers and dealers;

         - banks;

         - trust companies; and

         - clearing corporations.

Access to DTC’s book-entry system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or

maintain a custodial relationship with a participant whether directly or indirectly.

Upon the issuance of the global registered USD notes, DTC will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the respective

principal amounts of the individual beneficial interests represented by the global registered USD notes to the accounts of participants. The accounts
credited will be designated by the underwriters of the beneficial interests. Ownership of beneficial interests in the global registered USD notes is limited
to participants or persons that may hold interests through participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in the global registered USD notes is shown on,
and the transfer of those ownership interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to participants’ interests) and the
participants (with respect to the owners of beneficial interests in the global registered USD notes other than participants).

So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered holder and owner of the global registered USD notes, DTC or its nominee, as the case may

be, will be considered the sole legal owner of the USD notes represented by the global registered USD notes for all purposes under the indenture and the
USD notes. Except as set forth below, owners of beneficial interests in the global registered USD notes will not be entitled to receive definitive
registered USD notes and will not be considered to be the owners or holders of any USD notes under the global registered USD notes. Teva Finance III
understands that under existing industry practice, in the event an owner of a beneficial interest in the global registered USD notes desires to take any
action that DTC, as the holder of the global registered USD notes, is entitled to take, DTC would authorize the participants to take the action, and that
participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through the participants to take the action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of
beneficial owners owning through them. No beneficial owner of an interest in the global registered USD notes will be able to transfer the interest except
in accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures, in addition to those provided for under the indenture and, if applicable, those of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Teva Finance III will make payments of the principal and interest on the USD notes represented by the global registered USD notes

registered in the name of and held by DTC or its nominee to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner and holder of the global
registered USD notes.

S-61


-----

**Table of Contents**

Teva Finance III expects that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal or interest in respect of the global registered

USD notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of
the global registered USD notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Teva Finance III also expects that payments by participants and indirect
participants to owners of beneficial interests in the global registered USD notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions
and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for these customers. The
payments, however, will be the responsibility of the participants and indirect participants, and none of Teva Finance III, Teva, the trustee or any paying
agent will have any responsibility or liability for:

         - any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in the global registered USD
notes;

         - maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to the beneficial ownership interests;

         - any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and its participants; or

         - the relationship between the participants and indirect participants and the owners of beneficial interests in the global registered USD
notes.

Unless and until they are exchanged in whole or in part for definitive registered USD notes, the global registered USD notes may not be

transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC.

Participants in DTC will effect transfers with other participants in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will settle transfers

in same-day funds. Participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will effect transfers with other participants in the ordinary way in accordance with the
rules and operating procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable.

Cross-market transfers between DTC, on the one hand, and directly or indirectly through Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the

other, will be effected in DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its respective depositary;
however, these cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in the
system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (Brussels time). Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be,
will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its
behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the global registered USD notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal
procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to
the depositaries for Euroclear or Clearstream.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in the global

registered USD notes from a DTC participant will be credited during the securities settlement processing day immediately following the DTC settlement
date, and the credit of any transactions interests in the global registered USD notes settled during the processing day will be reported to the relevant
Euroclear or Clearstream participant on that day. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in the global registered USD
notes by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date, but will be
available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the Business Day following settlement in DTC.

Teva Finance III expects that DTC will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of USD notes only at the direction of one or more

participants to whose accounts at DTC interests in the global registered USD notes are credited and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the USD notes as to which the participant or participants has or have given direction. However, if there is an event of default under
the USD notes, DTC will exchange the global registered USD notes for definitive registered USD notes, which it will distribute to its participants.

**Table of Contents**

Although Teva Finance III expects that DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will agree to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate

transfers of interests in the global registered USD notes among participants of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are
under no obligation to perform or continue to perform these procedures, and these procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of Teva Finance
III, Teva, the trustee or any paying agent have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or indirect
participants of their obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

If DTC is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as a depositary for the global registered USD notes or ceases to be a clearing agency

registered under the Exchange Act and Teva Finance III does not appoint a successor depositary within 90 days, Teva Finance III will issue definitive
registered USD notes in exchange for the global registered USD notes.

**_Definitive USD notes. Definitive registered USD notes may be issued in exchange for USD notes represented by global registered USD notes only if_**
Teva Finance III does not appoint a successor depositary as set forth above under “—Global USD notes; Book-Entry Form” or in other limited
circumstances set forth in the indenture.

**UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of ownership and disposition of the notes. This

discussion only applies to notes that meet all of the following conditions:

     - they are purchased by those initial holders who purchase notes at the respective “issue price,” which will equal the first price to the public
(not including bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers) at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold for money; and

     - they are held as capital assets by U.S. Holders (as defined below).

This discussion assumes that the notes are not issued with original issue discount as that term is defined in the Internal Revenue Code of

1986, as amended (the “Code”) and the U.S. Treasury Regulations. This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to
holders in light of their particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as:

     - certain financial institutions, including banks;

     - insurance companies;

     - dealers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark to market method of accounting for their
securities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts or tax exempt entities;

     - persons holding notes as part of a hedge or other integrated investment, constructive sale or conversion transaction or straddle;

     - U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

     - U.S. expatriates or entities covered by the anti-inversion rules under the Code;

     - persons who actually or constructively own more than 10% of our stock by vote or value;

     - persons subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax;

     - holders who are members of an “expanded group” or “modified expanded group” with the Issuers within the meaning of U.S. Treasury
Regulations under Code Section 385;

     - tax-exempt and governmental organizations;

     - “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S.
federal income tax;

     - S corporations, partnerships or other entities (or arrangements) classified or treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes
(and investors therein); and

     - persons subject to the alternative minimum tax.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally

depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership holding our notes, you
should consult your tax advisors.

This summary is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed U.S. Treasury

Regulations, changes to any of which subsequent to the date of this prospectus summary may affect the tax consequences described herein. We have not,
and will not seek, any rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding the matters discussed below. This summary addresses only
U.S. federal income tax consequences, and does not address the state, local or foreign tax laws or the Medicare tax on net investment income. Persons
considering the purchase of notes are urged to consult their

S-64


-----

**Table of Contents**

own tax advisors with regard to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax consequences arising
under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

     - a citizen or resident of the United States;

     - a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or of any political subdivision thereof;

     - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

     - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more “United States persons” (as defined
in the Code) have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations to be treated as a “United States person.”

The term “U.S. Holder” also includes certain former citizens and residents of the United States.

Under recently enacted legislation, U.S. Holders that use an accrual method of accounting for tax purposes generally will be required to

include certain amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements. The application of this rule thus may
require the accrual of income earlier than would be the case under the general tax rules described below. U.S. Holders that use an accrual method of
accounting should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the potential applicability of this legislation to their particular situation.

**If you are considering the purchase of notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal**

**income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under the**
**laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

We may be required to make payments of additional amounts to holders of the notes under certain circumstances, including those

described under “Description of the Euro Notes and the Guarantees—Optional Redemption by the Issuer,” “Description of the Euro Notes and the
Guarantees—Additional Tax Amounts,” “Description of the Euro Notes and the Guarantees—Tax Redemption,” “Description of the Euro Notes and the
Guarantees—Payment of Interest, Premium and Principal,” “Description of the USD Notes and the Guarantees—Optional Redemption by the Issuer,”
“Description of the USD Notes and the Guarantees—Additional Tax Amounts,” “Description of the USD Notes and the Guarantees—Tax Redemption,”
“Description of the USD Notes and the Guarantees—Payment of Interest, Premium and Principal,” and “Description of the USD Notes and the
Guarantees—Optional Redemption by the Issuer” Our obligation to pay such excess amounts may implicate the provisions of the U.S. Treasury
Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” Under these regulations, however, a contingency will not cause a debt instrument to be
treated as a contingent payment debt instrument if, as of the issue date, such contingency is “remote” or is considered to be “incidental.” We intend to
take the position that the possibility of any such increase in interest does not result in the notes being treated as “contingent payment debt instruments”
under the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations. Our position is binding on you unless you disclose your contrary position in the manner required by the
applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations. It is possible that the IRS may take a different position, in which case you might, among other things, be required
to accrue interest income at a higher rate than the stated interest rate and to treat as ordinary interest income any gain realized on a disposition of the
notes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will not be considered contingent payment debt instruments. You should consult your
own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the notes and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of Interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the gross amount of interest on a note (which includes any foreign tax withheld) will

generally be “qualified stated interest,” as that term is defined in the Code

S-65


-----

**Table of Contents**

and the U.S. Treasury Regulations, and generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the time it is paid or accrued in
accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for tax purposes. In addition to interest on the notes, a U.S. Holder will be required to include
in income any additional amounts paid in respect of any foreign tax withheld.

If a U.S. Holder receives a payment of interest on a note denominated in euro and such U.S. Holder uses the cash method of accounting for

U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. Holder will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the interest
(including additional amounts) received on the notes, determined by translating the euro received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A U.S. Holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the
receipt of such payment, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros so received.

If a U.S. Holder receives a payment of interest on a note denominated in euro and such U.S. Holder uses the accrual method of accounting

for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or such U.S. Holder is otherwise required to accrue interest prior to receipt), the U.S. Holder may determine the
amount of income recognized with respect to interest (including additional amounts) received on the notes in accordance with either of two methods.
Under the first method, a U.S. Holder will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued
during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or,
in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, a
U.S. Holder may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on:

     - the last day of the accrual period;

     - the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual period straddles such U.S. Holder’s taxable
year; or

     - the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period.

This election will apply to all debt obligations that a U.S. Holder holds from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the

IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the advisability of making the above election.

Whether or not such election is made, with respect to notes denominated in euro, upon receipt of an interest payment on a note (including,

upon the sale of a note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), a U.S.
Holder will recognize U.S. source ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment
(determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income such
U.S. Holder previously included in income with respect to such payment. This exchange gain or loss will not be treated as an adjustment to interest
income or expense.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Interest income earned by a U.S. Holder will constitute foreign source income and be considered “passive category income” or, in the case

of certain U.S. Holders, “general category income” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which may be relevant to a U.S. Holder in calculating the
holder’s foreign tax credit limitation. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid with respect to the U.S. Holder at a rate applicable to such holder (including
the withholding tax described under “Israeli Tax Considerations—Israeli Tax Liability on Interest Payable by Teva to Non-Israeli Residents”) may be
eligible for foreign tax credits (or, at such holder’s election, a deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to
applicable limitations. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. The rules
governing foreign tax credits are complex and, therefore, U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax
credits in their particular circumstances.

**Table of Contents**

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement, or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a note, a U.S. Holder will recognize taxable gain or loss

equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement, or other taxable disposition and the Holder’s adjusted
tax basis in the note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note generally will equal its initial cost of that note. For these purposes, the amount realized
does not include any amount attributable to accrued interest. Amounts attributable to accrued interest are treated as interest as described under
“—Payments of Interest” above. In the case of a Euro note, a U.S. Holder’s initial cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro paid for such
note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase. If a U.S. Holder’s note is sold, exchanged, redeemed, retired or otherwise disposed of in a
taxable transaction for euro, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of
sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. If a U.S. Holder is a cash method taxpayer and the notes are traded on an established
securities market, euro paid or received will be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. An accrual
method taxpayer may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the
election is applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. If such U.S.
Holder is an accrual method taxpayer and does not make this election, the dollar equivalent of the amount realized will be determined by translating that
amount at the dollar spot rate for euro on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition and generally will recognize foreign currency
gain or loss (generally treated as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference, if any, between the dollar equivalent of the amount realized based on
the spot rates in effect on the date of disposition and the settlement date.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement, or other taxable

disposition of a note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement, or other taxable disposition the note has been held for more than one year. Certain non-corporate U.S. Holders are eligible for a
reduced rate of tax on long-term capital gains. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

A portion of a U.S. Holder’s gain or loss with respect to a Euro note may be treated as exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal

amount of such Euro note. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source gain or loss. For these
purposes, the principal amount of the Euro note is the purchase price for the Euro note calculated in euro on the date of purchase, and the amount of
exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Euro note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the
date the U.S. Holder purchased the Euro note. The amount of exchange gain or loss will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the
disposition of the Euro note.

Gain or loss recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Euro note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates

with respect to the principal amount of such Euro note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest
income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price
for the note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date principal is received from the Issuer or the U.S. Holder disposes of the Euro note, and the
U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Euro note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. Holder
purchased such Euro note. In addition, upon sale or other taxable disposition of a Euro note, a U.S. Holder may recognize exchange gain or loss
attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of
stated interest.” However, upon a sale or other taxable disposition of a Euro note, a U.S. Holder will recognize any exchange gain or loss (including with
respect to accrued stated interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. Holder on such disposition.

S-67


-----

**Table of Contents**

Gain or loss a U.S. Holder recognizes on the sale or other taxable disposition of the notes in excess of exchange gain or loss attributable to

such disposition generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. Holder has
held the notes for more than one year. For non-corporate U.S. Holders, long-term capital gains are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the deductibility of capital losses in its
particular circumstances.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

U.S. Treasury Regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions could be interpreted to cover transactions

generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, certain
transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a foreign currency note, or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note, to the extent that such sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. Holders considering the purchase of notes
should consult with their own tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the notes, including any
requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Information returns may be filed with the IRS in connection with payments on the notes and the proceeds from a sale, exchange,

redemption, retirement, or other taxable disposition of the notes. A U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S. backup withholding tax on these payments if the
U.S. Holder fails to provide its taxpayer identification number to the paying agent and comply with certain certification procedures or does not
otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as
a credit against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is
furnished to the IRS.

**_Specified foreign financial assets_**

Certain U.S. Holders that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000 are generally required to

file an information statement along with their tax returns, currently on Form 8938, with respect to such assets. “Specified foreign financial assets”
include any financial accounts held at a non-U.S. financial institution, as well as securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer (which may include notes issued
in certificated form) that are not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions. Higher reporting thresholds apply to certain individuals living
abroad and to certain married individuals. Regulations extend this reporting requirement to certain entities that are treated as formed or availed of to
hold direct or indirect interests in specified foreign financial assets based on certain objective criteria. U.S. Holders who fail to report the required
information could be subject to substantial penalties. In addition, the statute of limitations for assessment of tax would be suspended, in whole or part.
Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of these rules to their investment in the notes, including the
application of the rules to their particular circumstances.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a “foreign financial institution” may be

required to withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru payments” made after December 31, 2018, to the extent such payments are treated as
attributable to certain U.S. source payments.

Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final U.S. Treasury Regulations defining

“foreign passthru payments” are filed generally would be “grandfathered” unless

S-68


-----

**Table of Contents**

such obligations are materially modified after such date. The IRS has proposed to extend the start of this obligation to withhold on “foreign passthru
payments” to two years after applicable final U.S. Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are filed. As of the date of this prospectus
supplement, applicable final U.S. Treasury Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if Teva, Teva Finance II, or Teva Finance III is treated as a
foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the notes only if there is a significant modification of the notes for U.S. federal income
tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into, and others are expected to enter into,
intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Under such
intergovernmental agreements, the Issuer may be required to report certain information regarding investors to tax authorities in a non-U.S. jurisdiction,
which information may be shared with tax authorities in the United States. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may
apply to their investment in the notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the notes, there generally
will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**DUTCH TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain material Dutch tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes

by persons who are not residents of The Netherlands for Dutch tax purposes. It is not, however, a complete analysis of all the potential tax
considerations that may be applicable to all potential investors.

This summary does not apply to a holder of notes that is an affiliated entity of (one of) the Issuers for the purpose of the Dutch

Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet bronbelasting 2021), i.e. an entity that directly or indirectly, individually or jointly as part of a collaborating group,
holds a controlling interest in (one of) the Issuers.

For Dutch tax purposes, a holder of notes may include an individual who, or an entity that, does not have the legal title to any notes, but to

whom nevertheless notes are attributed based either on such individual or entity owning a beneficial interest in notes or based on specific statutory
provisions. These include statutory provisions pursuant to which notes are attributed to an individual who is, or who has directly or indirectly inherited
from a person who was, the settlor, grantor or similar originator of a trust, foundation or similar entity that holds such notes.

The following summary is based on Dutch tax law as applied and interpreted by Dutch courts and as published and in effect on the date of

this prospectus supplement, without prejudice to any amendments introduced at a later date and implemented with or without retroactive effect.

For the purpose of this section, “Dutch Taxes” shall mean taxes of whatever nature levied by or on behalf of The Netherlands or any of its

subdivisions or taxing authorities. “The Netherlands” means the part of the Kingdom of The Netherlands located in Europe.

**_Withholding tax_**

Any payments made under the notes will not be subject to withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Dutch Taxes.

**_Taxes on income and capital gains_**

This paragraph does not describe the possible Dutch tax considerations or consequences that may be relevant to a holder of notes who is an

individual and for whom the income or capital gains derived from the notes are attributable to employment activities, the income from which is taxable
in The Netherlands, nor does this paragraph address the Dutch tax consequences for entities which are a resident of Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten that
have an enterprise which is carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative on Bonaire, Sint Eustatius or Saba, and the
notes are attributable to such permanent establishment or permanent representative.

A holder of notes will not be subject to any Dutch Taxes on any payment made to that holder under the notes or on any capital gain

realized by the holder from the disposal, or deemed disposal, or redemption of the notes, except if:

(1) the holder of notes is, or is deemed to be, resident in The Netherlands for Dutch (corporate) income tax purposes;

(2) the holder of notes is an individual and has opted to be taxed as if resident in The Netherlands for Dutch income tax purposes;

(3) the holder of notes is an individual and derives profits from an enterprise, whether as entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a
co-entitlement to the net worth of the enterprise other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder, which enterprise is, in whole or in part,
carried on through a permanent

S-70

**Table of Contents**

establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in The Netherlands to which the notes are
attributable;

(4) the holder of notes is an individual and has a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang), or a fictitious substantial interest (fictief
_aanmerkelijk belang), in the Issuers or derives benefits from miscellaneous activities (overige werkzaamheden) carried out in The_
Netherlands in respect of the notes, including, without limitation, activities which are beyond the scope of active portfolio investment
activities;

(5) the holder of notes is not an individual and has a substantial interest, or a fictitious substantial interest, in the Issuers, which (fictitious)
substantial interest is part of an artificial structure and the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the chosen ownership structure is
the evasion of Dutch income tax of an individual;

(6) the holder of notes is not an individual and is entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise or a co-entitlement to the net worth of an
enterprise, other than by way of the holding of securities, which is effectively managed in The Netherlands and to which enterprise the
notes are attributable; or

(7) the holder of notes is an individual and is entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise, other than by way of securities, which is
effectively managed in The Netherlands and to which enterprise the notes are attributable.

Generally, a holder of notes has a substantial interest if such holder, alone or together with his partner, directly or indirectly:

(1) owns, or holds certain rights on, shares representing five percent or more of the total issued and outstanding capital of the Issuers, or of
the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares of the Issuers;

(2) holds rights to directly or indirectly acquire shares, whether or not already issued, representing five percent or more of the total issued
and outstanding capital of the Issuers, or of the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares of the Issuers; or

(3) owns, or holds certain rights on, profit participating certificates that relate to five percent or more of the annual profit of the Issuers or
to five percent or more of the liquidation proceeds of the Issuers.

A holder of notes who is an individual and has the ownership of shares of the Issuers, will also have a substantial interest if his partner or

one of certain relatives of the holder of notes or of his partner has a (fictitious) substantial interest.

For Dutch tax purposes, the ownership of shares of the Issuers is attributed to a holder of notes based either on that holder owning a

beneficial interest in shares of the Issuers or based on specific statutory provisions. These include statutory provisions pursuant to which shares are
attributed to an individual who is, or who has directly or indirectly inherited from a person who was, the settlor, grantor or similar originator of a trust,
foundation or similar entity that holds the shares of the Issuers, although the holder of notes does not have the legal title of such shares.

Generally, a holder of notes has a fictitious substantial interest if, without having an actual substantial interest in the Issuers:

(1) the shares have been obtained under gift law, inheritance law or matrimonial law, on a non-recognition basis, while the disposing
shareholder had a substantial interest in the Issuers;

(2) the shares have been acquired pursuant to a share merger, legal merger or legal demerger, on an elective nonrecognition basis, while the
holder of notes prior to this transaction had a substantial interest in a party to that transaction; or

S-71


-----

**Table of Contents**

(3) the shares held by the holder of notes, prior to dilution, qualified as a substantial interest and, by election, no gain was recognized upon
disqualification of these shares.

**_Gift tax or inheritance tax_**

No Dutch gift tax or inheritance tax is due in respect of any gift of the notes by, or inheritance of the notes on the death of, a holder of

notes, except if:

(1) at the time of the gift or death of the holder of notes, the holder of notes is resident, or deemed to be resident, in The Netherlands;

(2) the holder of notes passes away within 180 days after the date of the gift of the notes and is not, or is not deemed to be, at the time of
the gift, but is, or is deemed to be, at the time of his death, resident in The Netherlands; or

(3) the gift of the notes is made under a condition precedent and the holder of notes is resident, or deemed to be resident, in The
Netherlands at the time the condition is fulfilled.

For purposes of Dutch gift or inheritance tax, an individual who is of Dutch nationality will be deemed to be resident in The Netherlands if

he has been a resident in The Netherlands at any time during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or his death. For purposes of Dutch gift tax, any
individual, irrespective of his nationality, will be deemed to be resident in The Netherlands if he has been a resident in The Netherlands at any time
during the 12 months preceding the date of the gift.

**_Other taxes_**

No other Dutch Taxes, including turnover tax and taxes of a documentary nature, such as capital tax, stamp or registration tax or duty, are

payable by or on behalf of a holder of notes by reason only of the issue, acquisition or transfer of the notes.

**_Residency_**

Subject to the exceptions above, a holder of notes will not become resident, or a deemed resident, in The Netherlands for tax purposes, or

become subject to Dutch Taxes, by reason only of the Issuers’ performance, or the holder’s acquisition (by way of issue or transfer to it), holding and/or
disposal of the notes.

**ISRAELI TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain material Israeli tax considerations relating to the ownership of the notes by persons who are not_

_residents of the State of Israel for Israeli tax purposes. It is not, however, a complete analysis of all the potential tax considerations that may be_
_applicable to all potential investors._

**The following discussion is for general information only. It is also applicable to beneficial owners of the notes. Investors**

**considering the purchase of the notes should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the application of Israeli income tax laws to their**
**particular situations as well as any tax consequences arising under any non-Israeli taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.**

**_Israeli Tax Liability on Interest Payable by Teva to Non-Israeli Residents_**

An individual is subject to tax on interest at a reduced rate of up to 25%. The reduced rate is not available to an individual, if interest

expenses are claimed as tax deductions with respect to the notes, if the individual is a “substantial shareholder,” (“substantial shareholder” for these
purposes is a shareholder who holds directly or indirectly, including with others, at least 10% of any means of control in the company), if there is a
special relationship between the individual and the company paying out the interest (unless certain conditions are met), or if the interest is a business
income of the individual. In such cases, the individual will be subject to tax on the interest at his marginal tax rate. Individuals who are subject to tax in
Israel are also subject to an additional tax at a rate of 3% on annual income exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 647,640 for 2021 and thereafter, linked to
the annual change in the Israeli Consumer Price Index), including, but not limited to income derived from interest.

Corporate entities are subject to corporate tax on their interest income. The corporate tax rate is currently 23%.

Non-Israeli residents are required to file an income tax return in Israel if they have Israeli sourced interest income, unless the full amount

of tax was withheld.

**_Withholding Taxes on Interest Payable by Teva to Non-Israeli Residents_**

An Israeli company paying interest on a note denominated in a foreign currency to an individual who is a non-Israeli resident is required to

withhold tax at a rate of 25%, except for (i) interest paid to a “substantial shareholder” (as defined above), or (ii) interest paid to an employee, a service
provider or a supplier of such Israeli company, who are subject to withholding tax according to the highest marginal tax rate applicable to individuals.
Tax liability with respect to interest paid to non-Israeli residents by an Israeli company may be reduced under an applicable tax treaty. To benefit from
such reduced rate under an applicable tax treaty, such non-Israeli residents should file an Israeli tax return based on such lower rate.

An Israeli company paying interest on a similar note to a corporate entity will be subject to withholding tax in accordance with the

applicable corporate tax rate for the year in which the interest is paid, such rate is currently 23%.

The aforementioned might only apply if Teva as a guarantor pays interest on the notes.

We note that any payment in excess of the principal amount (whether upon maturity or early redemption) might be considered as interest

for Israeli tax purposes.

_Original Issue Discount. For Israeli income tax purposes, any principal amount reflecting original issue discount is generally treated in the_

same manner as interest.

To the extent notes are redeemed by Teva as described under “Description of the Euro Notes and the Guarantees—Tax Redemption” and

“Description of the USD Notes and the Guarantees—Tax Redemption,” holders of notes will be required to present withholding tax exemption
certificates issued by the Israeli Tax Authority to prevent withholding on account of Israeli taxes.

Teva, Teva Finance II and Teva Finance III have agreed to pay certain additional amounts in connection with withholding taxes or

deductions that may be imposed by Israeli or Dutch authorities. See “Description of the Euro Notes and the Guarantees—Additional Tax Amounts” and
“Description of the USD Notes and the Guarantees—Additional Tax Amounts.”

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriters have agreed, severally and not jointly, to

purchase all of the notes sold under the Underwriting Agreement if any notes are purchased. The Underwriters may offer and sell notes through certain
of their affiliates.

If an Underwriter defaults, the Underwriting Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Underwriters may

be increased, the commitments of the defaulting Underwriter may be assumed by other persons satisfactory to us or the Underwriting Agreement may be
terminated.

The Underwriters are offering the notes, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by them, subject to approval of legal

matters by their counsel, including the validity of the notes, and other conditions contained in the Underwriting Agreement, such as the receipt by the
Underwriters of officers’ certificates and legal opinions. The Underwriters reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to the public and to
reject orders in whole or in part.

Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. is not a U.S. registered broker-dealer, and will not effect any offers or sales of any notes in the United States unless

it is through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers as permitted by the regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

**Price Stabilization and Short Positions**

The Underwriters may engage in over-allotment and stabilizing transactions or purchases and passive market making for the purpose of

pegging, fixing or maintaining the prices of the notes in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act:

         - Over-allotment involves sales by the Underwriters of notes in excess of the number of notes the Underwriter is obligated to
purchase, which creates a short position. Since the Underwriters in this offering do not have an option to purchase additional
securities, their short position will be a naked short position. A naked short position can only be closed out by buying notes in the
open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the Underwriters are concerned that there could be downward
pressure on the prices of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this
offering.

         - Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. These
stabilizing transactions as well as other purchases made by the Underwriters for their own accounts may have the effect of raising or
maintaining the market prices of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market prices of the notes. As a result, the
prices of the notes may be higher than the prices that might otherwise exist in the open market. These transactions, if commenced,
may be discontinued at any time. The Underwriters also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular Underwriter repays
to the Underwriters a portion of the Underwriters’ discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased notes sold by
or for the account of such Underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions.

Neither we nor the Underwriters make any representations or predictions as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions

described above may have on the prices of the notes. In addition, neither we nor the Underwriters make representations that the representatives will
engage in these stabilizing transactions or that any transaction, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Lock-up Agreements**

The Issuers and Teva have agreed with the Underwriters that, unless they receive prior written consent of BNP Paribas, BNP Paribas

Securities Corp., BofA Securities Europe SA, BofA Securities, Inc., HSBC Bank plc and J.P. Morgan AG, they may not, subject to certain customary
exceptions, from the date of the Underwriting Agreement to the closing date of this offering, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, or contract to sell, or
otherwise dispose of any debt securities (other than the notes offered hereby) issued or guaranteed by the Issuers or Teva.

**Indemnification**

We have agreed to indemnify the several Underwriters against liabilities relating to this offering, including liabilities under the Securities

Act, and liabilities arising from breaches of certain representations and warranties contained in the Underwriting Agreement, and to contribute to
payments that the Underwriters may be required to make for these liabilities.

**Stamp Taxes**

Purchasers of the notes offered by this prospectus supplement may be required to pay stamp taxes and other charges under the laws and

practices of the country of purchase, in addition to the offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus supplement. Accordingly, we urge you to
consult a tax advisor with respect to whether you may be required to pay taxes or charges, as well as any other consequences that may arise under the
laws of the country of purchase.

**Canadian Legal Matters**

The notes may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are accredited investors, as defined in

National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in
National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the notes must be made in
accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for rescission or damages if this

prospectus supplement (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are
exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should
refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal
advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the underwriters are not required to comply

with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.

**Israeli Legal Matters**

This prospectus supplement does not constitute a prospectus under the Israeli Securities Law, 5728-1968 (the “Israeli Securities Law”) and

has not been filed with, or approved by, the Israel Securities Authority and is not, and under no circumstances is to be construed as, an advertisement or
a public offering of securities in Israel.

In Israel, this prospectus supplement may be distributed only to, and may be directed only at, (a) persons who qualify as one of the types of

investors listed in the First Addendum to the Israeli Securities Law, subject to and in accordance with the requirements set forth in the First Addendum
to the Israeli Securities Law, and (b) who have confirmed in writing that they are acquiring the notes for their own account and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof, except, to the extent permitted under the First Addendum to the Israeli Securities Law, for resale to
investors of the type listed therein.

**European Economic Area Legal Matters**

Solely for the purposes of the manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the

conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. A distributor should take into consideration the
manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in
respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Each Underwriter has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise

make available any notes to any retail investor in the European Economic Area. For the purposes of this provision the expression “retail investor” means
a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client
as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation.

Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the
EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This prospectus supplement has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member
State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the
Notes. This prospectus supplement is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**Dutch Legal Matters**

This prospectus supplement is directed only at qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. The notes have not, may not

and will not be offered, sold or delivered in the Netherlands, other than to qualified investors (gekwalificeerde beleggers). This prospectus supplement
must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not qualified investors (as defined in the Prospectus Regulation). Any investment or investment
activity to which this prospectus supplement relates is available only to qualified investors and will be engaged in only with qualified investors.
Recipients of this prospectus supplement are not permitted to transmit it to any other person.

**United Kingdom Legal Matters**

In the United Kingdom, this prospectus supplement is being distributed only to, and is directed only at, and any offer subsequently made

may only be directed at persons who are “qualified investors” (as defined in the Prospectus Regulation) (i) who have professional experience in matters
relating to investments falling within Article 19 (5) of the Order and/or (ii) who are high net worth companies (or persons to whom it may otherwise be
lawfully communicated) falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This
prospectus supplement must not be acted on or relied on in the United Kingdom by persons who are not relevant persons. In the United Kingdom, any
investment or investment activity to which this prospectus supplement relates is only available to, and will be engaged in with, relevant persons.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to

the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only ECPs, as defined in the COBS, and professional clients, as defined in UK MiFIR; and
(ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. A distributor should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available

to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions
of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA for offering or
selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been or will be prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the
securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**Italy Legal Matters**

The offering of the notes has not been registered with or cleared by the Italian Securities Exchange Commission (Commissione Nazionale

_per le Societá e la Borsa, “CONSOB”) pursuant to Italian securities legislation and, therefore, no notes may be offered, sold or delivered, nor may_
copies of this prospectus supplement or of any other document relating to the notes be distributed in the Republic of Italy, except: (a) to qualified
investors (investitori qualificati) as defined in Article 100 of Legislative Decree No. 58 of 24 February 1998, as amended (the “Financial Services Act”)
and Article 34-ter, first paragraph, letter b) of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of 14 May 1999, as amended from time to time (“Regulation
No. 11971”); or (b) in other circumstances which are exempted from the rules on public offerings pursuant to Article 100 of the Financial Services Act
and Article 34-ter of Regulation No. 11971.

Any offer, sale or delivery of the notes or distribution of copies of this prospectus supplement or any other document relating to the notes

in the Republic of Italy under (a) or (b) above may and will be effected in accordance with all Italian securities, tax, exchange control and other
applicable laws and regulations, and, in particular, must be: (i) made by an investment firm, bank or financial intermediary permitted to conduct such
activities in the Republic of Italy in accordance with the Financial Services Act, CONSOB Regulation No. 16190 of 29 October 2007 (as amended from
time to time) and Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993, as amended (the “Banking Act”); and (ii) in compliance with Article 129 of the
Banking Act, as amended, and the implementing guidelines of the Bank of Italy, as amended from time to time, pursuant to which the Bank of Italy may
request information on the issue or the offer of securities in the Republic of Italy; and (iii) in compliance with any other applicable laws and regulations
or requirements imposed by CONSOB or any other Italian authority.

Any investor purchasing the notes is solely responsible for ensuring that any offer or resale of the notes it purchased in this offering occurs

in compliance with applicable Italian laws and regulations.

Please note that in accordance with Article 100-bis of the Financial Services Act, where no exemption from the rules on public offerings

applies under (a) and (b) above, the subsequent resale of the notes on the secondary market in Italy must be made in compliance with the public offer
and the prospectus requirement rules provided under the Financial Services Act and Regulation No. 11971. Failure to comply with such rules may result
in the subsequent re-sale of such notes being declared null and void and in the liability of the intermediary transferring the notes for any damages
suffered by the investors.

**Hong Kong Legal Matters**

The contents of this prospectus supplement have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority in Hong Kong. The notes may not be

offered or sold in Hong Kong by means of any document other than (i) in circumstances which do not constitute an offer to the public within the
meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.32, Laws of Hong Kong), or (ii) to “professional investors” within the meaning of the Securities and Futures
Ordinance (Cap.571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder, or (iii) in other circumstances which do not result in the document being a
“prospectus” within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.32, Laws of Hong Kong), and no advertisement, invitation or document relating to
the notes may be issued or may be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each case whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere), which is
directed at, or the contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by, the public in Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the laws of Hong
Kong) other than with respect to notes which are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons outside Hong Kong or only to “professional
investors” within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS; LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES AND**

**THE INDENTURES**

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency and other legal considerations in the jurisdiction in which each Issuer is incorporated,_

_and a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the notes and the indentures. The description is only a summary and does not_
_purport to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity or enforceability of the notes and the indenture._
_In addition, the laws of more than one jurisdiction could potentially apply in respect of certain matters and laws in multiple jurisdictions could result in_
_disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply, which could adversely affect your rights and your ability to enforce your rights and collect payment_
_in full under the notes and the indenture. Prospective investors in the notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to all such limitations_
_and considerations._

**European Union**

Each Issuer is a company incorporated under the laws of a Member State or Member States of the European Union (in this section

references to Member States relate to member states of the European Union excluding Denmark), and in this case under the laws of the Netherlands. The
below guidance as to centre of main interests and any cross-border proceedings within the EU should be construed as a description of the current law as
at the date of this prospectus supplement.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast),

as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within all Member States, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of
main interests” (“COMI”) (which according to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation is “the place where the debtor conducts the administration
of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”) is situated shall have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency
proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member
States may have differing and even conflicting views.

Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a debtor has its COMI in the Member

State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary (which presumption shall not apply if the registered office has been
moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1), second
sentence, of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the COMI “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a
regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the COMI of a
debtor, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office
and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. Recital 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the presumption
should be rebutted where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a
comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of
management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and
may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency
proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

If the COMI of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in

respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would
be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings
commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States, although territorial
(secondary) insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State.

S-82


-----

**Table of Contents**

If the COMI of a debtor is in a Member State, under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State

have jurisdiction to commence territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the
meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to
mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency
proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of territorial (secondary) insolvency
proceedings in another EU Member State will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three-month period
prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings.

The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State.

Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may
only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in
the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under of the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial
insolvency proceedings is requested by (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within
the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member
State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether
the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex
_fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor._

The courts of all Member States must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same

effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court
in a Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it
by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain
limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the
contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. The EU Insolvency
Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the
appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members.

**Effects of EU Directive 2019/1023 on Restructuring and Insolvency**

On July 16, 2019, the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019, on preventive restructuring

frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency
and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (“EU Restructuring Directive”) entered into force. The Member States are required to
pass national laws to implement the directive by July 17, 2021, at the latest.

The EU Restructuring Directive aims to harmonize the laws and procedures of Member States concerning preventive restructurings and

insolvencies, to put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to
make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their quality. The key feature of the
EU Restructuring Directive is the introduction of a preventive restructuring framework. The EU Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards
to be applied by the Member States (i.e., minimum harmonization). Whereas certain features of the EU Restructuring Directive need to be transposed
into national legislation, the EU Restructuring Directive leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the implementation of

S-83


-----

**Table of Contents**

certain other features. In particular, when implementing the EU Restructuring Directive, Member States must ensure that, under their national laws,
companies will have access to a pre-insolvency restructuring framework which permits a haircut of debt and other restructuring measures on the basis of
a majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of claims in each class and where applicable a majority by numbers (meaning, for
instance, that an opposing creditor can be outvoted by the majority). The EU Restructuring Directive also provides for cross-class cramdown, i.e., even
if the creditors of one class voting on the restructuring plan did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the restructuring plan
might still be adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors. Further, the EU Restructuring Directive provides for a stay on enforcement, which
needs to be transposed into national legislation.

The implementation of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation might also include priority ranking for new financing.

Although the EU Restructuring Directive also foresees a number of safeguards protecting creditors from abuse and although it is not clear how exactly
the EU Restructuring Directive will be implemented in individual Member States, the current domestic insolvency law of some Member States may
change substantially if they lack any of the mechanisms that the EU Restructuring Directive will make mandatory. This might have considerable
repercussions for the position of creditors of a Member State legal entity. The description of the current Member State domestic insolvency regimes
must, therefore, be read with the understanding that they might change substantially.

**The Netherlands**

Where debtors have their COMI or an “establishment” in the Netherlands they may become subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings

governed by Dutch insolvency laws. This is particularly relevant to the Issuers which are all incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and have
their statutory seat (statutaire zetel) in the Netherlands, and which are therefore presumed (subject to proof to the contrary and exceptions under the EU
Insolvency Regulation) to have their COMI in the Netherlands. See further “—European Union” above.

Dutch insolvency laws differ significantly from insolvency proceedings in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and may make it more difficult

for you to recover the amount you would normally expect to recover in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. or another jurisdiction. There
are circumstances under Dutch insolvency law in which the granting by an Issuer of security and guarantees can be challenged. The following is a brief
description of certain aspects of the Dutch insolvency laws.

There are two insolvency regimes under Dutch law in relation to corporations. The first, a suspension of payments (surseance van

_betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy_
(faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate the assets of a debtor and distribute the proceeds thereof to its creditors. In practice a suspension of
payments often results in the bankruptcy of the debtor. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A
general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below.

Only the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its

debts as they fall due. Once the application has been filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint
one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft
composition (ontwerp akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will
be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the
provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted, unless a qualified minority (meaning, more than one-quarter of the
amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third of the number of creditors of the amount of claims held
by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential, creditors declare against it or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors
during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. That the

S-84


-----

**Table of Contents**

debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for
example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court
of a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order, a suspension of
payments will only affect unsecured, non-preferential creditors. During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent
(i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to a suspension of payments or (ii) seek
recourse against the asset.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of the

debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the
creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a
debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself, provided it has obtained
prior approval of its general meeting to file an application for its own bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the necessity of
such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy
proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated and the
proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent certain creditors’ claims have
equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims.

Certain parties, such as secured creditors, can benefit from special rights. Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce

their rights separately from bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs; however, enforcement of the security interest might be
subject to the following: (i) a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order
pursuant to Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (which may be a total period of eight months if the similar statutory stay of execution under
Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (referred to above) is first applied during suspension of payments), which has the same effects as set forth
above for stays of execution in suspensions of payment; (ii) a receiver in bankruptcy (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose its security interest
within a reasonable time (as determined by the receiver in bankruptcy pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver
in bankruptcy will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs;
and (iii) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s receiver in bankruptcy and may not be offset against an unsecured claim of
the company’s secured creditor.

A suspension of payment and bankruptcy proceedings against Dutch debtors would allow secured creditors (and in the case of suspension

of payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against the assets (that secure
their claims) as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a statutory stay of execution as described above may be ordered by the
competent court both in a suspension of payments and bankruptcy. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike
secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of
the bankrupt debtor’s assets. Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must be respected.
These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory stay of execution of security rights and other rights, as described
above, may be imposed. Furthermore, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security right within a reasonable period of
time, failing which the receiver in bankruptcy will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in
respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of any
enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such set-off may be
allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although at that time it may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the
claim used for the set-off.

S-85


-----

**Table of Contents**

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when a suspension of payments is granted,

and will terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the
suspension of payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be)
subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically
stayed. Both a suspension of payments and bankruptcy have retroactive effect from 00.00 hours of the day on which the suspension of payments or the
bankruptcy of the relevant Dutch company is declared.

Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be

binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is: (i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors
represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted; and
(ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the
notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest
accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments or bankruptcy is granted cannot be claimed in a composition.

All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a

bankruptcy liquidation, entitled to distributions. If the bankruptcy has ended with a composition, a claim that has not been submitted for verification
within the deadline set therefore can no longer be enforced. Any remaining funds will be distributed to the company’s shareholders. “Verification” under
Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a
bankruptcy, the unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy then makes
a determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings (for
voting).

In case of bankruptcy, creditors who wish to dispute the receiver in bankruptcy’s verification of their claims will be referred to a claim

validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim, while in a suspension of payments the court
will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These procedures could cause holders of notes to recover less than the principal
amount of their notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. The claim validation (renvooi) proceedings could also cause
payments to the holders of notes to be delayed. The claim of a creditor, other than a claim to the extent that it is secured by Dutch law security, may be
limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Claims that fall due more than one year after the date of
the bankruptcy, will be valued for distribution purposes as of the date the bankruptcy was declared. Claims that become payable within one year after the
bankruptcy was declared will be considered payable from the day the bankruptcy was declared. Interest on claims accruing after the bankruptcy order
date cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria, such as in case of the notes. To the
extent that interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in
respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy.

**_The Dutch Scheme_**

With the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord)

(“CERP”) on 1 January 2021, debtors now have the possibility to offer a composition outside bankruptcy or moratorium of payments proceedings. The
CERP provides for a proceeding to restructure debts of companies in financial distress outside insolvency proceedings (the “Dutch Scheme”). The
CERP provides that a debtor or a court-appointed restructuring expert may offer creditors (including secured creditors) and shareholders a composition
plan. Upon confirmation by the court, such plan is binding on the

S-86


-----

**Table of Contents**

creditors and shareholders to which it has been offered and changes their rights. A composition plan under the CERP can also extend to claims against
group companies of the debtor on the account of securities and guarantees for the debtor’s obligations, if inter alia (i) the relevant group companies are
reasonably expected to be unable to continue to pay their debts as they fall due and (ii) the Dutch courts would have jurisdiction if the relevant group
company would offer its creditors and shareholders a composition plan under the CERP. Jurisdiction of the Dutch courts under the CERP may extend to
entities incorporated or residing outside the Netherlands on the basis that there is a connection with the jurisdiction of the Netherlands.

Under the CERP, voting on a composition plan is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of

two-third of the claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two-thirds of the shares of that class that have
voted on the plan. The CERP provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a non-consenting class (cross-class cram down). Under
the CERP, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a
distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of
a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives
under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an affected creditor of a
non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment
of that class.

Under the CERP, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of 4 months, with a possible extension of 4 months. During

such period, inter alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action to enforce security
over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights
of pledge.

Under the CERP, claims of creditors against the Issuers can be compromised as a result of a composition plan adopted and confirmed in

accordance with the CERP. A composition plan under the CERP can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or
are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the CERP can affect the rights of the trustee and/or the holders of the notes under the indentures and
therefore the notes.

**ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS**

This prospectus is part of a Registration Statement that Teva and the other registrants filed with the United States Securities and Exchange

Commission (the “SEC”) as a “well-known seasoned issuer” as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”),
utilizing a “shelf” registration process. Under this shelf process, any of the registrants may, from time to time, sell the securities described in this
prospectus in one or more offerings.

This prospectus provides you with a general description of the securities which we may offer and the related guarantees, if any, of those securities.

Each time we sell securities we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the offering. The
prospectus supplement may also add, update or change information contained in this prospectus. You should read both this prospectus and any
prospectus supplement together with additional information described below under the heading “Where You Can Find More Information” before
purchasing any of our securities.

We have not authorized anyone to provide any information or to make any representation other than those contained or incorporated by reference

in this prospectus. “Incorporated by reference” means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you to another document filed
separately with the SEC. We have not authorized any other person to provide you with different information. If anyone provides you with different or
inconsistent information, you should not rely on it. We are not making, and we will not make, an offer to sell securities in any jurisdiction where the
offer or sale is not permitted. You should assume that the information appearing in this prospectus and any supplement to this prospectus is current only
as of the dates on their respective covers. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed since that date.

**Business Overview**


**TEVA PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LIMITED**


We are a global pharmaceutical company, committed to helping patients around the world to access affordable medicines and benefit from

innovations to improve their health. Our mission is to be a global leader in generics, specialty medicines and biopharmaceuticals, improving the lives of
patients.

We operate worldwide, with headquarters in Israel and a significant presence in the United States, Europe and many other markets around the

world. Our key strengths include our world-leading generic medicines expertise and portfolio, focused specialty medicines portfolio and global
infrastructure and scale.

Teva was incorporated in Israel on February 13, 1944 and is the successor to a number of Israeli corporations, the oldest of which was established

in 1901.

**Our Business Segments**

We operate our business through three segments: North America, Europe and International Markets. Each business segment manages our entire

product portfolio in its region, including generics, specialty and over-the-counter (“OTC”) products. This structure enables strong alignment and
integration between operations, commercial regions, R&D and our global marketing and portfolio function, optimizing our product lifecycle across
therapeutic areas.

In addition to these three segments, we have other activities, primarily the sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) to third parties,

certain contract manufacturing services and an out-licensing platform offering a portfolio of products to other pharmaceutical companies through our
affiliate Medis.

**FINANCE SUBSIDIARIES**

Teva has organized various finance subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing debt securities. There are no separate financial statements of the finance

subsidiaries in this prospectus because these entities are, or will be treated as, subsidiaries of Teva for financial reporting purposes. We do not believe
the financial statements would be helpful to the holders of the securities of these entities because:

     - Teva is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and owns, directly or
indirectly, all of the voting interests of these entities;

     - these entities do not have any independent operations and do not propose to engage in any activities other than issuing securities and
investing the proceeds in Teva or its affiliates; and

     - these entities’ obligations under the securities will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Teva. These entities are exempt from the
information reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

The disclosure and analysis in this prospectus, including statements that are predictive in nature, or that depend upon or refer to future events or

conditions, contain or incorporate by reference some forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and
Section 27A of the Securities Act, which are based on management’s current beliefs and expectations and are subject to substantial risks and
uncertainties, both known and unknown, that could cause our future results, performance or achievements to differ significantly from that expressed or
implied by such forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “should,” “expect,”
“anticipate,” “estimate,” “target,” “may,” “project,” “guidance,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe” and other words and terms of similar meaning and
expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Important factors that could cause or contribute to such
differences include risks relating to:

     - our ability to successfully compete in the marketplace, including: that we are substantially dependent on our generic products;
consolidation of our customer base and commercial alliances among our customers; delays in launches of new generic products; the
increase in the number of competitors targeting generic opportunities and seeking U.S. market exclusivity for generic versions of
significant products; our ability to develop and commercialize biopharmaceutical products; competition for our specialty products,
including AUSTEDO[®], AJOVY[®] and COPAXONE[®]; our ability to achieve expected results from investments in our product pipeline;
our ability to develop and commercialize additional pharmaceutical products; and the effectiveness of our patents and other measures to
protect our intellectual property rights;

     - our substantial indebtedness, which may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, engage in additional transactions or make new
investments, may result in a further downgrade of our credit ratings; and our inability to raise debt or borrow funds in amounts or on terms
that are favorable to us;

     - our business and operations in general, including: uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, financial
condition, operations, cash flows, and liquidity and on the economy in general; our ability to successfully execute and maintain the
activities and efforts related to the measures we have taken or may take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated costs
therewith; effectiveness of our optimization efforts; our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled personnel; manufacturing or quality
control problems; interruptions in our supply chain; disruptions of information technology systems; breaches of our data security;
variations in intellectual property laws; challenges associated with conducting business globally, including political or economic
instability, major hostilities or terrorism; costs and delays resulting from the extensive pharmaceutical regulation to which we are subject
or delays in governmental processing time due to travel and work restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; the effects of reforms in
healthcare regulation and reductions in pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement and coverage; significant sales to a limited number of
customers; our ability to successfully bid for suitable acquisition targets or licensing opportunities, or to consummate and integrate
acquisitions; and our prospects and opportunities for growth if we sell assets;

     - compliance, regulatory and litigation matters, including: failure to comply with complex legal and regulatory environments; increased
legal and regulatory action in connection with public concern over the abuse of opioid medications and our ability to reach a final
resolution of the remaining opioid-related litigation; scrutiny from competition and pricing authorities around the world, including our
ability to successfully defend against the U.S. Department of Justice criminal charges of Sherman Act violations; potential liability for
patent infringement; product liability claims; failure to comply with complex Medicare and Medicaid reporting and payment obligations;
compliance with anti-corruption sanctions and trade control laws; and environmental risks; and

     - other financial and economic risks, including: our exposure to currency fluctuations and restrictions as well as credit risks; potential
impairments of our intangible assets; potential significant increases in tax

liabilities (including as a result of potential tax reform in the United States); and the effect on our overall effective tax rate of the
termination or expiration of governmental programs or tax benefits, or of a change in our business.

The forward-looking statements contained or incorporated by reference herein involve a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties

that could cause our future results, performance or achievements to differ significantly from the results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by such forward-looking statements. You should understand that many important factors, in addition to those discussed or incorporated by
reference in this prospectus, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Potential factors that
could affect our results, include, in addition to others not described in this prospectus, those referenced under “Risk Factors.” These are factors that we
think could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expected results.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward
looking statements or other information contained in this prospectus, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may
be required by law. You are advised, however, to consult any additional disclosures we make in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our subsequently
filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K that are filed with the SEC. See “Risk Factors.” Other factors besides those

**Table of Contents**

**DESCRIPTION OF ORDINARY SHARES**

_The following is a summary of the terms of Teva ordinary shares, including certain provisions contained in Teva’s memorandum of association_

_(the “Memorandum”), Teva’s articles of association (the “Articles”) and applicable Israeli laws in effect on the date of this Registration Statement. This_
_summary is qualified by reference to the full text of the Memorandum and the Articles, which are incorporated by reference as exhibits hereto._

**Description of Ordinary Shares**

The par value of Teva’s ordinary shares is NIS 0.10 per share, and all issued and outstanding ordinary shares are fully paid and non-assessable.

Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to participate equally in the receipt of dividends and other distributions and, in the event of liquidation, in all
distributions after the discharge of liabilities to creditors. All ordinary shares represented by the ADSs will be issued in registered form only. The Israeli
Companies Law, 5759-1999 (the “Companies Law”) and the Articles do not provide for preemptive rights to the holders of Teva’s shares. Each Teva
ordinary share entitles the holder thereof to one vote.

Neither the Memorandum nor the Articles or the laws of the State of Israel restrict the ownership or voting of Teva’s ordinary shares or ADSs by

non-residents or persons who are not citizens of Israel, except with respect to citizens or residents of countries that are in a state of war with Israel.

**General Shareholder Meetings**

Under the Companies Law and the Articles, Teva is required to hold an annual general meeting every calendar year, no later than 15 months after

the previous annual general meeting. In addition, Teva is required to convene a special meeting of shareholders:

     - upon the demand of two directors or one-quarter of the serving directors;

     - upon the demand of one or more shareholders holding at least 5% of our issued share capital and 1% or more of our voting rights; and

     - upon the demand of one or more shareholders holding at least 5% of our voting rights;

provided that a demand by a shareholder to convene a special shareholders meeting must set forth the matters to be considered at the meeting and
otherwise comply with all other requirements of applicable law and the Articles.

If the board of directors receives a demand to convene a special meeting satisfying the above conditions, it must announce the scheduling of the

meeting within 21 days after the demand was delivered, subject to the relevant requirements of the Companies Law and the regulations thereunder. If the
board of directors fails to do so, the party who demanded to convene the special meeting may convene the meeting itself, subject to the provisions of the
Companies Law.

The agenda of a general meeting is determined by the board of directors. The agenda must also include matters for which the convening of a

special meeting was demanded, as well as any matter requested by one or more shareholders who hold at least 1% of Teva’s voting rights, subject to
complying with certain requirements. Pursuant to Israeli law, a Teva shareholder who wishes to include a matter on the agenda of a general meeting
must submit the request within seven days of publication of the notice with respect to the general meeting or within 14 days of a preliminary notice of
the intention to convene the general meeting, if such was filed, in order for it to be eligible to be considered at the general meeting. Under the Articles, a
request by a shareholder who holds at least 1% of Teva’s voting rights to include a matter on the agenda of a general meeting must be submitted in
writing to Teva no later than 14 days after the first publication of Teva’s annual consolidated financial statements preceding the annual general meeting
at which the consolidated financial statements for such year are to be presented. Any such demands or requests must comply with the requirements of
applicable law, applicable stock exchange rules and the Articles.

**Table of Contents**

**Notices**

Pursuant to the Companies Law, the regulations thereunder and the Articles, Teva is generally required to announce the convening of general

meetings at least 35 days in advance, but is not required to deliver personal notices of a general meeting or of any adjournment thereof to shareholders.
Teva may reasonably determine the method of publicizing the convening of general meetings, including by publishing a notice in one or more daily
newspapers in Israel or in one or more international wire services, and any such publication will be deemed to have been duly given and delivered on the
date of such publication. Shareholders as of the record date determined in respect of the general meeting are entitled to participate in and vote at the
meeting. The Articles require that shareholder meetings take place in Israel, unless Teva’s center of management has been transferred to another country
in accordance with the Articles.

**Voting and Quorum Requirements**

The quorum required for a general meeting of shareholders is at least two shareholders present in person or by proxy or represented by an

authorized representative, who jointly hold at least 25% of our paid-up share capital. If a meeting is adjourned for lack of a quorum, it will generally be
adjourned to the same time and place on the same day of the following week unless the board of directors sets another date, time and place in a notice to
all persons who are entitled to receive notice of general meetings. Should no legal quorum be present at such reconvened meeting a half hour following
the time set for such meeting, the necessary quorum consists of any two shareholders present, in person or by proxy, who jointly hold at least 20% of
Teva’s paid-up share capital.

A shareholder who intends to vote at a meeting must demonstrate ownership of shares in accordance with the Companies Law and the regulations

promulgated thereunder.

**Shareholder Resolutions**

The Companies Law provides that resolutions on certain matters, such as amending a company’s articles of association, exercising the authority of

the board of directors in certain circumstances, appointing auditors, approving certain transactions, increasing or decreasing the registered share capital
and approving certain mergers, must be approved by the shareholders at a general meeting. A company may determine in its articles of association
certain additional matters with respect to which decisions will be made by the shareholders at a general meeting.

Generally, under the Articles, shareholder resolutions are deemed adopted if approved by the holders of a simple majority of the voting rights

represented at a general meeting in person or by proxy and voting, unless a different majority is required by law or the Articles. Pursuant to the
Companies Law and the Articles, certain shareholder resolutions (for example, resolutions amending many of the provisions of the Articles) require the
affirmative vote of at least 75% of the voting rights represented at a general meeting and voting in person or by proxy, and certain other amendments to
the Articles require the affirmative vote of at least 85% of the voting rights represented in a general meeting voting in person or by proxy, unless the
board of directors sets a lower percentage, by a supermajority of three-quarters of the voting directors.

**Change of Control**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Companies Law requires that a merger (which, for these purposes, is defined as involving two Israeli companies)

be approved by both the board of directors and by the shareholders of each of the merging companies and, with respect to the target company, if its share
capital is divided into more than one class, the approval of each class of shares is required (in accordance with the majority and legal quorum
requirements set forth in the Companies Law and the Articles). However, a merger may not be approved if it is objected to by shareholders holding a
majority of the voting rights participating and voting at the meeting (disregarding any abstentions), after excluding the shares held by the other party to
the merger, by any person

9


-----

**Table of Contents**

who holds 25% or more of the other party to the merger or by anyone on their behalf, including the relatives of or corporations controlled by these
persons, unless an Israeli court determines otherwise at the request of shareholders holding at least 25% of the voting rights of the company.

In approving a merger, the board of directors of both merging companies must determine that there is no reasonable concern that, as a result of the

merger, the surviving company will not be able to satisfy its obligations to its creditors. Similarly, upon the request of a creditor of either party to the
proposed merger, an Israeli court may prevent or delay the merger if it concludes that there exists a reasonable concern that, as a result of the merger, the
surviving company will not be able to satisfy the obligations of the merging parties. A court may also issue other instructions for the protection of
creditors’ rights in connection with a merger. Further, a merger may not be completed unless at least (i) 50 days have passed from the time that the
requisite proposals for the approval of the merger were filed with the Israeli Registrar of Companies; and (ii) 30 days have passed since the merger was
approved by the shareholders of each party to the merger.

Under the Companies Law, subject to certain exceptions, an acquisition of shares in a public company must be made by means of a tender offer if,

as a result of the acquisition, the purchaser would hold (i) 25% or more of the voting rights of the company if there is no other holder of 25% or more of
the company’s voting rights; or (ii) more than 45% of the voting rights of the company if there is no other holder of more than 45% of the company’s
voting rights. This requirement does not apply to certain events set forth in the Companies Law, including a purchase of shares by an offeree in a
“private placement” that receives specific shareholder approval. The board of directors must either give the shareholders its opinion as to the advisability
of the tender offer or explain why it is unable to do so. The board of directors must also disclose any personal interest of any of its members in the
proposed acquisition. The tender offer may be consummated only if (i) at least 5% of the company’s voting rights will be acquired; and (ii) the majority
of the offerees who responded to the offer accepted the offer, excluding offerees who are controlling shareholders of the offeror, offerees who hold 25%
or more of the voting rights in the company or who have a personal interest in accepting the tender offer, or anyone on their behalf or on behalf of the
offeror including the relatives of or corporations controlled by these persons.

Under the Companies Law, a person may not acquire shares in a public company if, after the acquisition, he will hold more than 90% of the shares

or more than 90% of any class of shares of that company, unless a tender offer is made to purchase all of the shares or all of the shares of the particular
class, which we refer to as a full tender offer. The Companies Law also generally provides that as long as a shareholder in a public company holds more
than 90% of the company’s shares or of a class of shares, that shareholder shall be precluded from purchasing any additional shares. In order that all of
the shares that the purchaser offered to purchase be transferred to the purchaser by operation of law, one of the following must have occurred: (i) the
shareholders who declined or who did not respond to the full tender offer hold less than 5% of the company’s outstanding share capital or of the relevant
class of shares and the majority of offerees who do not have a personal interest in accepting the full tender offer accepted the offer, or (ii) the
shareholders who declined or who did not respond to the full tender offer hold less than 2% of the company’s outstanding share capital or of the relevant
class of shares.

If the conditions set forth above are not met, the purchaser may not acquire shares of the company from shareholders who accepted the full tender

offer to the extent that following such acquisition, the purchaser would own more than 90% of the company’s issued and outstanding share capital or
more than 90% of the particular class of shares with respect to which the full tender offer was made.

A shareholder that had his or her shares so transferred, whether he or she accepted the full tender offer or not, has the right, within six months

from the date of acceptance of the full tender offer, to petition the court to determine that the full tender offer was for less than fair value and that the fair
value should be paid as determined by the court. However, subject to certain conditions, the purchaser may provide in its offer that shareholders who
accept the full tender offer will not be entitled to such rights.

**Board of Directors**

Our board of directors consists of three classes of directors plus the chief executive officer, who is not part of any class. One of the classes is

elected each year by the shareholders at our annual meeting for a term of approximately three years. Elected directors cannot be removed from office by
the shareholders until the expiration of their term of office, unless they violate their duties of care or loyalty.

In accordance with the Companies Law, we have elected to comply with SEC and NYSE requirements for independent directors on the Board and

audit and compensation committees, in lieu of the Israeli requirements for statutory independent directors and audit committee and compensation
committee composition. Following such election, we no longer designate any of our directors as statutory independent directors or designated
independent directors under Israeli law.

The holders of our ordinary shares representing a majority of the voting power represented at a shareholders’ meeting and voting at the meeting

have the power to elect all of the directors up for election.

In general, the board of directors formulates company policy and supervises the performance of the chief executive officer. Subject to the

provisions of the Companies Law and the Articles, any Teva power that has not been conferred upon another body may be exercised by the board of
directors.

Neither our Memorandum or Articles, nor Israeli law, mandate retirement of directors at a certain age, or share ownership for a director’s

qualification.

**Conflicts of Interest**

_Approval of Related Party Transactions_

The Companies Law requires that an “office holder” (as defined in the Companies Law) of a company promptly disclose any personal interest that

he or she may have and all related material information known to him or her, in connection with any existing or proposed transaction of the company.

Pursuant to the Companies Law, any transaction with an office holder or in which the office holder has a personal interest (other than with respect

to such office holder’s Terms of Office and Employment) must be brought before the audit committee, in order to determine whether such transaction is
an “extraordinary transaction” (defined as a transaction not in the ordinary course of business, not on market terms or likely to have a material impact on
the company’s profitability, assets or liabilities). The term “Terms of Office and Employment,” as defined in the Companies Law, includes
compensation, equity-based awards, releases from liability, indemnification and insurance, severance and other benefits.

Pursuant to the Companies Law, the Articles and Teva policy, in the event the audit committee determines that the transaction is not an

extraordinary transaction, the transaction will require only audit committee approval; if, however, it is determined to be an extraordinary transaction,
board of directors approval is also required, and in some circumstances shareholder approval may also be required. Such a transaction may only be
approved if it is determined to be in the best interests of Teva.

A person with a personal interest in the matter generally may not be present at meetings of the board of directors or certain committees where the

matter is being considered and, if a member of the board of directors or a committee, may generally not vote on the matter.

_Transactions with Controlling Shareholders_

Under Israeli law, extraordinary transactions with a controlling shareholder or in which the controlling shareholder has a personal interest and any

engagement with a controlling shareholder or a controlling

11


-----

**Table of Contents**

shareholder’s relative with respect to the provision of services to the company or with their Terms of Office and Employment as an office holder or their
employment, if they are not office holders, generally require the approval of the audit committee (or with respect to Terms of Office and Employment,
the compensation committee), the board of directors and the shareholders. If required, shareholder approval must include at least a majority of the
shareholders who do not have a personal interest in the transaction and are present and voting at the meeting (abstentions are disregarded), or,
alternatively, that the total shareholdings of the disinterested shareholders who vote against the transaction cannot represent more than two percent of the
voting rights in the company. Transactions for a period of more than three years generally need to be brought for approval in accordance with the above
procedures every three years.

A shareholder who holds 25% or more of the voting rights in a company is considered a controlling shareholder for these purposes if no other

shareholder holds more than 50% of the voting rights. If two or more shareholders are interested parties in the same transaction, their shareholdings are
combined for the purposes of calculating percentages.

**Approval of Director and Executive Officer Compensation**

As required by the Companies Law, we have adopted a compensation policy regarding the Terms of Office and Employment of our office holders

(the “Compensation Policy”).

Pursuant to the Companies Law, arrangements between Teva and its office holders must generally be consistent with the Compensation Policy.

However, under certain circumstances, we may approve an arrangement that is not consistent with the Compensation Policy, if such arrangement is
approved by a special disinterested majority of our shareholders.

In addition, pursuant to the Companies Law, the Terms of Office and Employment of office holders generally require the approval of the

compensation committee and the Board of Directors. The Terms of Office and Employment of directors (including those of a chief executive officer
who is a director) further require the approval of the shareholders by a simple majority; with respect to a chief executive officer who is not a director, the
approval of the shareholders by the special disinterested majority is also generally required. Pursuant to regulations promulgated under the Companies
Law, shareholder approval is not required with respect to the remuneration granted to a director or a chief executive officer for the period following his
or her appointment until the next general meeting of shareholders, provided such remuneration is approved by the compensation committee and the
Board of Directors, is consistent with the Compensation Policy and is on similar or less favorable terms than those of such person’s predecessor.

Under certain circumstances, if the Terms of Office and Employment of office holders who are not directors are not approved by the shareholders

(where such approval is required), the compensation committee and the Board of Directors may nonetheless approve such terms. In addition,
non-material amendments of the Terms of Office and Employment of office holders who are not directors may be approved by the compensation
committee only and non-material amendments of the Terms of Office and Employment of executive officers other than the chief executive officer may
be approved by the chief executive officer only, provided such approval is permitted under the Compensation Policy.

**Insurance, Exemption and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers**

The Companies Law provides that a company may not exempt or indemnify a director or an executive officer, or enter into an insurance contract,

which would provide coverage for any liability incurred as a result of any of the following: (i) a breach by the director and/or executive officer of his or
her duty of loyalty unless, with respect to insurance coverage or indemnification, due to a breach of his or her duty of loyalty to the company committed
in good faith and with reasonable grounds to believe that such act would not prejudice the interests of the company; (ii) a breach by the director and/or
the executive officer of his or her duty of care to the company

12


-----

**Table of Contents**

committed intentionally or recklessly (other than if solely done in negligence); (iii) any act or omission done with the intent of unlawfully realizing
personal gain; or (iv) a fine, monetary sanction, forfeit or penalty imposed upon a director and/or executive officer. In addition, the Companies Law
provides that directors and executive officers can be exempted in advance with respect to liability for damages caused as a result of a breach of their
duty of care to the company (but not for such breaches committed intentionally or recklessly, as noted above, or in connection with a distribution (as
defined in the Companies Law)).

Pursuant to indemnification and release agreements, we release our directors and executive officers from liability and indemnify them to the

fullest extent permitted by law and the Articles. Under these agreements, our undertaking to indemnify each director and executive officer for certain
payments and expenses as well as monetary liabilities imposed by a court judgment (including a settlement or an arbitrator’s award that was approved
by a court), which indemnification of monetary liabilities (i) shall be limited to matters that are connected or otherwise related to certain events or
circumstances set forth therein, and (ii) shall not exceed $200 million in the aggregate per director or executive officer. Under Israeli law,
indemnification is subject to other limitations, including those described above. Subject to applicable law, we may also indemnify our directors and
officers following specific events.

Our directors and executive officers are also covered by directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.

**Dividends**

Under the Companies Law, dividends may generally be distributed only out of profits, provided that there is no reasonable concern that the

distribution will prevent us from satisfying our existing and anticipated obligations when they become due. In accordance with the Companies Law and
the Articles, the decision to distribute dividends and the amount to be distributed is made by the board of directors.

**CEO and Center of Management**

Under the Articles, our chief executive officer is required to be a resident of Israel and our board of directors is required to consist of a meaningful

representation of Israeli resident directors, unless, in each case, our center of management has been transferred to another country in accordance with the
Articles. The Articles require that our center of management remain in Israel, unless the board of directors otherwise resolves, by a supermajority of
three-quarters of the participating votes.

**Exchange Controls**

Non-residents of Israel who purchase ADSs with U.S. dollars or other non-Israeli currency will be able to receive dividends, if any, and any

amounts payable upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of Teva, in U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the time of
conversion. Dividends to non-Israeli residents are subject to withholding.

**DESCRIPTION OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES**

_This section summarizes certain information regarding the American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (the_

_“Company”), each of which represents one ordinary share of the Company. The following description is only a summary and does not purport to be_
_complete and is qualified by reference to the Memorandum, the Articles, and our Second Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement, by and among the_
_Company, Citibank, N.A., as depositary, and the holders and beneficial owners of ADSs issued thereunder, dated as of December 4, 2018 (the “Deposit_
_Agreement”), each of which is incorporated by reference as exhibits hereto._

**American Depositary Shares and Receipts**

**General**

ADSs represent ownership interests in securities that are on deposit with the depositary bank. ADSs may be represented by certificates that are

commonly known as “American Depositary Receipts” or “ADRs.” The depositary bank typically appoints a custodian to safekeep the securities on
deposit. Citibank N.A., having its principal office at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013, U.S.A., is acting as depositary bank for our
ADSs and the custodians are Citibank Tel Aviv and Citibank, N.A.

The Company has appointed Citibank as depositary bank pursuant to the Deposit Agreement.

Each ADS represents the right to receive one ordinary share on deposit with the custodian. An ADS also represents the right to receive any other

property received by the depositary bank or the custodian on behalf of the owner of the ADS but that has not been distributed to the owners of ADSs
because of legal restrictions or practical considerations. The custodian, the depositary bank and their respective nominees will hold all deposited
property for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of ADSs. The deposited property does not constitute the proprietary assets of the depositary
bank, the custodian or their nominees. Beneficial ownership in the deposited property will under the terms of the Deposit Agreement be vested in the
beneficial owners of the ADSs. The depositary bank, the custodian and their respective nominees will be the record holders of the deposited property
represented by the ADSs for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of the corresponding ADSs. Owners of ADSs will be able to exercise
beneficial ownership interests in the deposited property only through the registered holders of the ADSs, by the registered holders of the ADSs (on
behalf of the applicable ADS owners) only through the depositary bank, and by the depositary bank (on behalf of the owners of the corresponding
ADSs) directly, or indirectly through the custodian or their respective nominees, in each case upon the terms of the Deposit Agreement.

Owners of ADSs become a party to the Deposit Agreement and will be bound to its terms and to the terms of any ADR that represents ADSs. The

Deposit Agreement and the ADR specify the rights and obligations of the Company, the depositary bank and the ADS owners. The Deposit Agreement
and the ADRs are governed by New York law. However, the Company’s obligations to the holders of ordinary shares will continue to be governed by
the laws of the State of Israel, which may be different from the laws of the United States.

Owners of ADSs may hold ADSs either by means of an ADR registered in their name, through a brokerage or safekeeping account, or through an

account established by the depositary bank in their name reflecting the registration of uncertificated ADSs directly on the books of the depositary bank
(commonly referred to as the “direct registration system” or “DRS”). The direct registration system reflects the uncertificated (book-entry) registration
of ownership of ADSs by the depositary bank. Under the direct registration system, ownership of ADSs is evidenced by periodic statements issued by
the depositary bank to the holders of the ADSs. The direct registration system includes automated transfers between the depositary bank and The
Depository Trust Company, or DTC, the central book-entry clearing and settlement system for equity securities in the United States.

**Table of Contents**

**Dividends and Distributions**

Holders of ADSs generally have the right to receive distributions made by the Company on the securities deposited with the custodian. Receipt of

these distributions may be limited, however, by practical considerations and legal limitations. Holders of ADSs will receive such distributions under the
terms of the Deposit Agreement in proportion to the number of ADSs held as of a specified record date, after deduction of the applicable fees, taxes and
expenses.

**Distributions of Cash**

Whenever the Company makes a cash distribution for the securities on deposit with the custodian, the Company will deposit the funds with the

depositary bank or the custodian on behalf of the depositary bank. Upon receipt of confirmation of the deposit of the requisite funds, the depositary bank
will arrange for the funds to be converted into U.S. dollars and for the distribution of the U.S. dollars to the holders, subject to the laws and regulations
of the State of Israel.

The conversion into U.S. dollars will take place only if practicable and if the U.S. dollars are transferable to the United States. The depositary

bank will apply the same method for distributing the proceeds of the sale of any property (such as undistributed rights) held by the custodian in respect
of securities on deposit.

The distribution of cash will be made net of the fees, expenses, taxes and governmental charges payable by holders under the terms of the Deposit

Agreement. The depositary bank will hold any cash amounts it is unable to distribute in a non-interest bearing account for the benefit of the applicable
holders and beneficial owners of ADSs until the distribution can be effected or the funds that the depositary bank holds must be escheated as unclaimed
property in accordance with the laws of the relevant states of the United States.

**Distributions of Shares**

Whenever the Company makes a free distribution of shares for the securities on deposit with the custodian, the Company will deposit the

applicable number of shares with the custodian. Upon receipt of confirmation of such deposit, the depositary bank will either distribute to holders new
ADSs representing the ordinary shares deposited or modify the ADS-to-shares ratio, in which case each ADS held by holders will represent rights and
interests in the additional ordinary shares or preference shares so deposited. Only whole new ADSs will be distributed. Fractional entitlements will be
sold and the proceeds of such sale will be distributed as in the case of a cash distribution.

The distribution of new ADSs or the modification of the ADS-to-ordinary shares ratio upon a distribution of ordinary shares or preference shares

will be made net of the fees, expenses, taxes and governmental charges payable by holders under the terms of the Deposit Agreement. In order to pay
such taxes or governmental charges, the depositary bank may sell all or a portion of the new ordinary shares so distributed. No such distribution of new
ADSs will be made if it would violate a law (i.e., the U.S. securities laws) or if it is not operationally practicable. If the depositary bank does not
distribute new ADSs as described above, it may sell the shares received upon the terms described in the Deposit Agreement and will distribute the
proceeds of the sale as in the case of a distribution of cash.

**Elective Distributions of Cash or Shares**

Whenever the Company intends to distribute a dividend payable at the election of shareholders either in cash or in additional shares, it will give

prior notice thereof to the depositary bank and will indicate whether it wishes the elective distribution to be made available to holders. In such case, the
Company will assist the depositary bank in determining whether such distribution is lawful and reasonably practicable.

15


-----

**Table of Contents**

The depositary bank will make the election available to holders only if it is reasonably practicable and if the Company has provided all of the

documentation contemplated in the Deposit Agreement. In such case, the depositary bank will establish procedures, in consultation with the Company,
to enable holders to elect to receive either cash or additional ADSs, in each case as described in the Deposit Agreement.

If the election is not made available to holders, holders will receive either cash or additional ADSs, depending on what a shareholder under Israeli

law would receive upon failing to make an election, as more fully described in the Deposit Agreement.

**Distribution of Rights**

Whenever the Company intends to distribute rights to purchase additional ordinary shares, it will give prior notice to the depositary bank and will

assist the depositary bank in determining whether it is lawful and reasonably practicable to distribute rights to purchase additional ADSs to holders.

The depositary bank will establish procedures, in consultation with the Company, to distribute rights to purchase additional ADSs to holders and

to enable such holders to exercise such rights if it is lawful and reasonably practicable to make the rights available to holders of ADSs, and if the
Company provides all of the documentation contemplated in the Deposit Agreement (such as opinions to address the lawfulness of the transaction).
Holders may have to pay fees, expenses, taxes and other governmental charges to subscribe for the new ADSs upon the exercise of their rights. The
depositary bank is not obligated to establish procedures to facilitate the distribution and exercise by holders of rights to purchase new ordinary shares
other than in the form of ADSs.

The depositary bank will not distribute the rights to holders if:

     - the Company does not timely request that the rights be distributed to holders or the Company requests that the rights not be distributed to
holders; or

     - the Company fails to deliver satisfactory documents to the depositary bank; or

     - it is not reasonably practicable to distribute the rights.

The depositary bank will sell the rights that are not exercised or not distributed if such sale is lawful and reasonably practicable. The proceeds of

such sale will be distributed to holders as in the case of a cash distribution. If the depositary bank is unable to sell the rights, it will allow the rights to
lapse.

**Other Distributions**

Whenever the Company intends to distribute property other than cash, ordinary shares or rights to purchase additional ordinary shares, it will

notify the depositary bank in advance and will indicate whether it wishes that such distribution be made to holders of ADSs. If so, the Company will
assist the depositary bank in determining whether such distribution to holders is lawful and reasonably practicable. If it is reasonably practicable to
distribute such property to holders and if the Company provides all of the documentation contemplated in the Deposit Agreement, the depositary bank
will distribute the property to the holders in a manner it, in consultation with the Company, deems practicable.

The distribution will be made net of fees, expenses, taxes and governmental charges payable by holders under the terms of the Deposit Agreement.

In order to pay such taxes and governmental charges, the depositary bank may, in consultation with the Company, sell all or a portion of the property
received.

The depositary bank will not distribute the property to holders and will sell the property if:

     - the Company does not request that the property be distributed to holders or if the Company asks that the property not be distributed to
holders; or

16


-----

**Table of Contents**

     - the Company does not deliver satisfactory documents to the depositary bank; or

     - the depositary bank determines, in consultation with the Company, that all or a portion of the distribution to holders is not reasonably
practicable.

The proceeds of such a sale will be distributed to holders as in the case of a cash distribution.

**Redemption**

Whenever the Company intends to redeem any of the securities on deposit with the custodian, it will notify the depositary bank in advance. If it is

practicable and if the Company provides all of the documentation contemplated in the Deposit Agreement, the depositary bank will provide notice of the
redemption to the holders.

The custodian will be instructed to surrender the shares being redeemed against payment of the applicable redemption price. The depositary bank

will convert the redemption funds received into U.S. dollars upon the terms of the Deposit Agreement and will establish procedures to enable holders to
receive the net proceeds from the redemption upon surrender of their ADSs to the depositary bank. Holders may have to pay fees, expenses, taxes and
other governmental charges upon the redemption of their ADSs. If less than all ADSs are being redeemed, the ADSs to be retired will be selected by lot
or on a pro rata basis, as the depositary bank may determine in consultation with the Company.

**Changes Affecting Ordinary Shares and Preference Shares**

The ordinary shares held on deposit for ADSs may change from time to time. For example, there may be a change in nominal or par value,

a split-up, cancellation, consolidation or reclassification of such ordinary shares or a recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of
assets.

If any such change were to occur, the ADSs would, to the extent permitted by law, represent the right to receive the property received or

exchanged in respect of the new ordinary shares held on deposit. The depositary bank may in such circumstances deliver new ADSs to holders, amend
the Deposit Agreement, the applicable ADRs and the applicable Registration Statement(s) on Form F-6, call for the exchange of existing ADSs for new
ADSs and take any other actions that are appropriate to reflect as to the ADSs the change affecting the ordinary shares. If the depositary bank may not
lawfully distribute such property to holders, the depositary bank may sell such property and distribute the net proceeds to holders as in the case of a cash
distribution.

**Issuance of ADSs upon Deposit of Ordinary Shares**

Upon receipt of notice from the custodian confirming (i) that a deposit of ordinary shares has been made pursuant to the requirements of the

Deposit Agreement, (ii) that all required documentation has been received, and (iii) the person(s) to whom ADSs are deliverable and the number of
ADSs to be delivered, the depositary bank will issue, subject to the terms of the Deposit Agreement, applicable law and payment of all applicable
charges, taxes and other governmental fees, ADSs to the persons named in the custodian’s notice. The depositary bank will only issue ADSs in whole
numbers.

When a holder makes a deposit of ordinary shares, such holder will be responsible for transferring good and valid title to the depositary bank. As

such, holders will be deemed to represent and warrant that:

     - the ordinary shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and legally obtained;

     - all preemptive (and similar) rights, if any, with respect to such ordinary shares have been validly waived or exercised;

     - the person making the deposit is duly authorized to deposit the ordinary shares;

17


-----

**Table of Contents**

     - the ordinary shares presented for deposit are free and clear of any lien, encumbrance, security interest, charge, mortgage or adverse claim,
and the ADSs issuable upon such deposit will not be “restricted securities” (as defined in the Deposit Agreement); and

     - the ordinary shares presented for deposit have not been stripped of any rights or entitlements.

If any of the representations or warranties are incorrect in any way, the Company and the depositary bank may, at holders’ cost and expense, take

any and all actions necessary to correct the consequences of the misrepresentations.

**Transfer, Combination and Split of ADRs**

Holders are entitled to transfer, combine or split up their ADRs and the ADSs evidenced thereby. For transfers of ADRs, holders will have to

surrender the ADRs to be transferred to the depositary bank and also:

     - ensure that the surrendered ADR is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer;

     - provide such proof of identity and genuineness of signatures as the depositary bank deems appropriate;

     - provide any transfer stamps required by the State of New York or the United States; and

     - pay all applicable fees, charges, expenses, taxes and other government charges payable by ADR holders pursuant to the terms of the
Deposit Agreement, upon the transfer of ADRs.

To have ADRs either combined or split up, holders must surrender the ADRs in question to the depositary bank with a request to have them

combined or split up, and holders must pay all applicable fees, charges and expenses payable by ADR holders, pursuant to the terms of the Deposit
Agreement, upon a combination or split up of ADRs.

**Withdrawal of Ordinary Shares upon Cancellation of ADSs**

Holders of ADSs are entitled to present their ADSs to the depositary bank for cancellation and then receive the corresponding number of

underlying ordinary shares at the custodian’s offices. Holders’ ability to withdraw the ordinary shares may be limited by U.S. and Israeli legal
considerations applicable at the time of withdrawal. In order to withdraw the ordinary shares represented by ADSs, holders will be required to pay to the
depositary bank the fees for cancellation of ADSs and any charges and taxes payable upon the transfer of the ordinary shares being withdrawn. Holders
assume the risk for delivery of all funds and securities upon withdrawal. Once canceled, the ADSs will not have any rights under the Deposit
Agreement.

If holders hold ADSs registered in their name, the depositary bank may ask such holders to provide proof of identity and genuineness of any

signature and such other documents as the depositary bank may deem appropriate before it will cancel the ADSs. The withdrawal of the ordinary shares
represented by the ADSs may be delayed until the depositary bank receives satisfactory evidence of compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
The depositary bank will only accept ADSs for cancellation that represent a whole number of securities on deposit.

Holders have the right to withdraw the securities represented by ADSs at any time except for:

     - temporary delays that may arise because (i) the transfer books for the ordinary shares or ADSs are closed, or (ii) ordinary shares are
immobilized on account of a shareholders’ meeting or a payment of dividends;

     - outstanding obligations to pay fees, taxes and similar charges; or

     - restrictions imposed because of laws or regulations applicable to ADSs or the withdrawal of securities on deposit.

18


-----

**Table of Contents**

The Deposit Agreement may not be modified to impair holders’ right to withdraw the securities represented by their ADSs, except to comply with

mandatory provisions of law.

**Reports and Communications**

The Company will furnish to the depositary bank all notices of shareholders’ meetings, proxy soliciting material and other reports and

communications that are made generally available to the holders of ordinary shares and English translations of the same (including a summary, in
English, of any applicable provisions or proposed provisions of the Articles that may be relevant to such notices, reports and communications). The
depositary bank will make such notices, reports and communications available for inspection by holders of ADSs at its principal office when furnished
by the Company pursuant to the Deposit Agreement and, upon request by the Company, will mail such notices, reports and communications to holders
at the Company’s expense.

**Voting Rights**

Holders of ADSs generally have the right under the Deposit Agreement to instruct the depositary bank to exercise the voting rights for the

ordinary shares represented by their ADSs.

At the Company’s request, the depositary bank will distribute to holders any notice of shareholders’ meeting received from the Company together

with information explaining how to instruct the depositary bank to exercise the voting rights of the securities represented by ADSs.

If the depositary bank timely receives voting instructions from a holder of ADSs, it will endeavor to vote the securities (in person or by proxy)

represented by the holder’s ADSs in accordance with such voting instructions.

The ability of the depositary bank to carry out voting instructions may be limited by practical and legal limitations and the terms of the securities

on deposit. The Company cannot assure that holders will receive voting materials in time to enable them to return voting instructions to the depositary
bank in a timely manner. Securities for which no voting instructions have been received will not be voted.

**Fees and Charges**

Holders of ADSs will be required to pay the following service fees to the depositary bank:

**Service** **Fees**


(1) Issuance of ADSs (e.g., an issuance upon a deposit of shares, upon a
change in the ADS(s)-to-share(s) ratio, or for any other reason), excluding
issuances as a result of distributions described in paragraph (4) below.

(2) Cancellation of ADSs (e.g., a cancellation of ADSs for delivery of
deposited shares, upon a change in the ADS(s)-to-share(s) ratio, or for any
other reason).

(3) Distribution of cash dividends or other cash distributions (e.g., upon a sale
of rights and other entitlements).

(4) Distribution of ADSs pursuant to (i) stock dividends or other free stock
distributions, or (ii) exercise of rights to purchase additional ADSs.

(5) Distribution of securities other than ADSs or rights to purchase additional
ADSs (e.g., spin-off shares).


Up to U.S. $5.00 per 100 ADSs (or fraction thereof) issued.

Up to U.S. $5.00 per 100 ADSs (or fraction thereof) cancelled.

Up to U.S. $5.00 per 100 ADSs (or fraction thereof) held.

Up to U.S. $5.00 per 100 ADSs (or fraction thereof) held.

Up to U.S. $5.00 per 100 ADSs (or fraction thereof) held.


(6) ADS Services. Up to U.S. $5.00 per 100 ADSs (or fraction thereof) held on the
applicable record date(s) established by the depositary bank.

19


-----

**Table of Contents**

Holders of ADSs will also be responsible to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the depositary bank and certain taxes and governmental

charges such as:

(1) taxes and other governmental charges;

(2) fees related to the transfer and registration of ordinary shares charged by the registrar and transfer agent (i.e., upon deposit and withdrawal
of ordinary shares);

(3) expenses for cable, telex and fax transmissions and for delivery of securities;

(4) expenses incurred for converting foreign currency into U.S. dollars;

(5) expenses incurred in connection with compliance with exchange control regulations and other regulatory requirements; and

(6) fees and expenses incurred in connection with the delivery or servicing of ordinary shares on deposit.

Depositary fees payable upon the issuance and cancellation of ADSs are typically paid to the depositary bank by the brokers (on behalf of their

clients) receiving the newly issued ADSs from the depositary bank and by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) delivering the ADSs to the depositary
bank for cancellation. The brokers in turn charge these fees to their clients. Depositary fees payable in connection with distributions of cash or securities
to holders and the depositary services fee are charged by the depositary bank to the holders of record of ADSs as of the applicable ADS record date.

The Depositary fees payable for cash distributions are generally deducted from the cash being distributed. In the case of distributions other than

cash (i.e., stock dividend, rights), the depositary bank charges the applicable fee to the ADS record date holders concurrent with the distribution. In the
case of ADSs registered in the name of the investor (whether certificated or uncertificated in direct registration), the depositary bank sends invoices to
the applicable record date ADS holders. In the case of ADSs held in brokerage and custodian accounts (via DTC), the depositary bank generally collects
its fees through the systems provided by DTC (whose nominee is the registered holder of the ADSs held in DTC) from the brokers and custodians
holding ADSs in their DTC accounts. The brokers and custodians who hold their clients’ ADSs in DTC accounts in turn charge their clients’ accounts
the amount of the fees paid to the depositary banks.

In the event of refusal to pay the depositary fees, the depositary bank may, under the terms of the Deposit Agreement, refuse the requested service

until payment is received or may set off the amount of the depositary fees from any distribution to be made to the holder.

The fees and charges holders may be required to pay may vary over time and may be changed by the Company and by the depositary bank.

Holders will receive prior notice of such changes.

The depositary bank may reimburse the Company for certain expenses incurred by the Company in respect of the ADR program established

pursuant to the Deposit Agreement, by making available a portion of the depositary fees charged in respect of the ADR program or otherwise, upon such
terms and conditions as the Company and the depositary bank may agree from time to time.

**Amendment and Termination**

The Company may agree with the depositary bank to modify the Deposit Agreement at any time without holders’ consent. The Company

undertakes to give holders 30 days’ prior notice of any modifications that would materially prejudice any of their substantial rights under the Deposit
Agreement. Modifications to the Deposit Agreement shall be deemed not to materially prejudice holders’ substantial existing rights if such
modifications are reasonably necessary for the ADSs to be registered under the Securities Act or to be eligible for book-entry settlement, in each case
without imposing or increasing the fees and charges holders are required to pay. In addition, the Company may not be able to provide holders with prior
notice of any modifications or supplements that are required to accommodate compliance with applicable provisions of law.

20

**Table of Contents**

Holders will be bound by the modifications to the Deposit Agreement if they continue to hold ADSs after the modifications to the Deposit

Agreement become effective. The Deposit Agreement cannot be amended to prevent holders from withdrawing the ordinary shares represented by their
ADSs (except in order to comply with applicable by law).

The Company has the right to direct the depositary bank to terminate the Deposit Agreement. Similarly, the depositary bank may in certain

circumstances on its own initiative terminate the Deposit Agreement. In either case, the depositary bank must give notice to holders at least 30 days
before termination. Until termination, holders’ rights under the Deposit Agreement will be unaffected.

After termination, the depositary bank will continue to collect distributions received (but will not distribute any such property until holders request

the cancellation of their ADSs) and may sell the securities held on deposit. After the sale, the depositary bank will hold the proceeds from such sale and
any other funds then held for holders in a non-interest bearing account. At that point, the depositary bank will have no further obligations to holders
other than to account for the funds then held for holders still outstanding (after deduction of applicable fees, taxes and expenses).

**Book of Depositary**

The depositary bank will maintain ADS holder records at its depositary office. Holders may inspect such records at such office during regular

business hours but solely for the purpose of communicating with other holders in the interest of business matters relating to the ADSs and the Deposit
Agreement.

The depositary bank will maintain in New York City (Borough of Manhattan) facilities to record and process the issuance, cancellation,

combination, split-up and transfer of ADSs. These facilities may be closed from time to time, to the extent not prohibited by law.

**Limitations on Obligations and Liabilities**

The Deposit Agreement limits the obligations of the Company and the depositary bank to the holders of ADSs as follows:

     - the Company and the depositary bank are obligated only to take the actions specifically stated in the Deposit Agreement without
negligence or bad faith;

     - both the Company and the depositary bank disclaim any liability for any failure to carry out voting instructions, for any manner in which a
vote is cast or for the effect of any vote, provided they act in good faith and in accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement;

     - both the Company and the depositary bank disclaim any liability for any failure to accurately determine the lawfulness or practicality of
any action, for the investment risks associated with investing in ordinary shares, for the validity or worth of the ordinary shares, for the
value of ordinary shares or any distribution or interest thereon, for any tax consequences that result from the ownership of ADSs, for the
credit-worthiness of any third party, for allowing any rights to lapse under the terms of the Deposit Agreement; for any action of or failure
to act by, or any information provided or not provided by, DTC or any DTC participant;

     - the depositary bank disclaims any liability for the content of any information submitted to it by the Company for distribution to holders or
for any inaccuracy of any translation thereof or for the failure or timeliness of any notice from the Company;

     - the Company and the depositary bank will not be obligated to perform any act that is inconsistent with the terms of the Deposit
Agreement;

     - the Company and the depositary bank disclaim any liability if the Company or the custodian or the depositary bank are prevented or
forbidden from or subject to any civil or criminal penalty or restraint

21

**Table of Contents**

on account of, or delayed in, doing or performing any act or thing required by the terms of the Deposit Agreement, by reason of any
provision, present or future of any applicable law or regulation, or by reason of present or future provision of any provision of our Articles,
or any provision of or governing the securities on deposit, or by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstances beyond the
Company’s control;

     - the Company and the depositary bank disclaim any liability by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for
in the Deposit Agreement or in the Articles or in any provisions of or governing the securities on deposit;

     - the Company and the depositary bank further disclaim any liability for any action or inaction in reliance on the advice or information
received from legal counsel, accountants, any person presenting ordinary shares for deposit, any holder of ADSs or authorized
representatives thereof, or any other person believed by the Company or the depositary bank in good faith to be competent to give such
advice or information;

     - the Company and the depositary bank also disclaim liability for the inability of certain holders to benefit from any distribution, offering,
right or other benefit that is made available to holders of ordinary shares but is not, under the terms of the Deposit Agreement, made
available to such holders;

     - the Company and the depositary bank also disclaim liability for any action or inaction of any clearing or settlement system (and any
participant thereof) for the deposited property or the ADSs;

     - the Company and the depositary bank may rely without any liability upon any written notice, request or other document believed to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper parties; and

     - the Company and the depositary bank also disclaim liability for any consequential or punitive damages for any breach of the terms of the
Deposit Agreement.

**Taxes**

Holders will be responsible for the taxes and other governmental charges payable on the ADSs and the securities represented by the ADSs. The

Company, the depositary bank and the custodian may deduct from any distribution the taxes and governmental charges payable by holders and may sell
any and all property on deposit to pay the taxes and governmental charges payable by holders. Holders will be liable for any deficiency if the sale
proceeds do not cover the taxes that are due.

The depositary bank may refuse to issue ADSs, to deliver, transfer, split and combine ADRs or to release securities on deposit until all taxes and

charges are paid by the applicable holder. The depositary bank and the custodian may take reasonable administrative actions to obtain tax refunds and
reduced tax withholding for any distributions on behalf of holders. However, holders may be required to provide to the depositary bank and to the
custodian proof of taxpayer status and residence and such other information as the Company, the depositary bank and the custodian may require to fulfill
legal obligations. Holders are required to indemnify the Company, the depositary bank and the custodian for any claims with respect to taxes based on
any tax benefit obtained for holders.

**Foreign Currency Conversion**

The depositary bank will arrange for the conversion of all foreign currency received into U.S. dollars if such conversion is practical, and it will

distribute the U.S. dollars in accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement. Holders may have to pay fees and expenses incurred in converting
foreign currency, such as fees and expenses incurred in complying with currency exchange controls and other governmental requirements.

22


-----

**Table of Contents**

If the conversion of foreign currency is not practical or lawful, or if any required approvals are denied or not obtainable at a reasonable cost or

within a reasonable period, the depositary bank may take the following actions in its discretion:

     - convert the foreign currency to the extent practical and lawful and distribute the U.S. dollars to holders for whom the conversion and
distribution is lawful and practical; or

     - distribute the foreign currency to holders for whom the distribution is lawful and practical; or

     - hold the foreign currency (without liability for interest) for the applicable holders.

**DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES AND GUARANTEES**

We or any of the other finance subsidiaries may elect to offer debt securities. The following description of debt securities sets forth the material

terms and provisions of the debt securities to which any prospectus supplement may relate. Our senior debt securities would be issued under a senior
indenture between Teva and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. Teva’s subordinated debt securities would be issued under a subordinated
indenture between Teva and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee.

The senior debt securities of each finance subsidiary would be issued under a senior indenture among that entity, Teva, as guarantor, and The Bank

of New York Mellon, as trustee. The subordinated debt securities of each finance subsidiary would be issued under a subordinated indenture among that
entity, Teva, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee.

All of the indentures are sometimes referred to in this prospectus collectively as the “indentures” and each, individually, as an “indenture.” All

senior indentures are sometimes referred to in this prospectus collectively as the “senior indentures” and each, individually, as a “senior indenture.” All
subordinated indentures are sometimes referred to in this prospectus collectively as the “subordinated indentures” and each, individually, as a
“subordinated indenture.” The particular terms of the debt securities offered by any prospectus supplement, and the extent to which the general
provisions described below may apply to the offered debt securities, will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. The indentures will be
qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The terms of the debt securities will include those stated in the indentures and those made
part of the indentures by reference to the Trust Indenture Act.

Because the following summaries of the material terms and provisions of the indentures and the related debt securities are not complete, you

should refer to the forms of the indentures and the debt securities for complete information on some of the terms and provisions of the indentures,
including definitions of some of the terms used below, and the debt securities. The senior indentures and subordinated indentures are substantially
identical to one another, except for specific provisions relating to subordination contained in the subordinated indentures.

**General**

The provisions of the indentures do not limit the aggregate principal amount of debt securities which may be issued thereunder. Unless otherwise

provided in a prospectus supplement, the senior debt securities will be the issuer’s direct, unsecured and unsubordinated general obligations and will
have the same rank in liquidation as all of the issuer’s other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The subordinated debt securities will be unsecured
obligations of the issuer, subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the issuer with respect to such series,
as described below under “Subordination of the Subordinated Debt Securities” and in the applicable prospectus supplement.

**Payments**

The issuer may issue debt securities from time to time in one or more series. The provisions of the indentures allow the issuer to “reopen” a

previous issue of a series of debt securities and issue additional debt securities of that series, as well as debt securities of other series. The debt securities
may be denominated and payable in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. The issuer may also issue debt securities from time to time with the principal
amount or interest payable on any relevant payment date to be determined by reference to one or more currency exchange rates, securities or baskets of
securities, commodity prices or indices. Holders of these types of debt securities will receive payments of principal or interest that depend upon the
value of the applicable currency, security or basket of securities, commodity or index on the relevant payment dates.

Debt securities may bear interest at a fixed rate, which may be zero, a floating rate, or a rate which varies during the lifetime of the debt security.

Debt securities bearing no interest or interest at a rate that at the time of issuance is below the prevailing market rate may be sold at a discount below
their stated principal amount.

**Table of Contents**

under applicable laws or regulations, including laws and regulations relating attributes required for the debt securities to be afforded
certain capital treatment for bank regulatory or other purposes.

Some of the debt securities may be issued as original issue discount securities. Original issue discount securities bear no interest or bear interest at

below-market rates and may be sold at a discount below their stated principal amount. The applicable prospectus supplement will contain information
relating to income tax, accounting, and other special considerations applicable to original issue discount securities.

**Registration and Transfer of Debt Securities**

Holders may present debt securities for exchange, and holders of registered debt securities may present these securities for transfer, in the manner,

at the places and subject to the restrictions stated in the debt securities and described in the applicable prospectus supplement. The issuer will provide
these services without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection with these services and subject to any limitations or
requirements provided in the applicable indenture or the supplemental indenture or issuer order under which that series of debt securities is issued. If any
of the securities are held in global form, the procedures for transfer of interests in those securities will depend upon the procedures of the depositary for
those global securities.

**Events of Default**

Each indenture provides holders of debt securities with remedies if the issuer and/or guarantor, as the case may be, fails to perform specific

obligations, such as making payments on the debt securities, or if the issuer and/or guarantor, as the case may be, becomes bankrupt. Holders should
review these provisions and understand which actions trigger an event of default and which actions do not. Each indenture permits the issuance of debt
securities in one or more series, and, in many cases, whether an event of default has occurred is determined on a series-by-series basis.

An event of default is defined under the indentures, with respect to any series of debt securities issued under that indenture, as any one or more of

the following events, subject to modification in a supplemental indenture, each of which we refer to in this prospectus as an event of default, having
occurred and be continuing:

     - default is made in the payment of principal in respect of the securities;

     - default is made for more than 30 days in the payment of interest in respect of the securities;

     - the issuer and/or guarantor, as the case may be, fails to perform any of its other obligations under the securities and this failure has
continued for the period of 90 days following service of notice on the issuer and/or guarantor requiring the same to be remedied;

     - issuer’s and/or guarantor’s, as the case may be, bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
insolvency related reorganization law;

     - an order is made or an effective resolution is passed for the winding up or liquidation of the issuer and/or guarantor, as the case may be; or

     - any other event of default provided in the supplemental indenture or issuer order, if any, under which that series of debt securities is issued.

**Acceleration of Debt Securities Upon an Event of Default**

Each indenture provides that, unless otherwise set forth in a supplemental indenture:

     - if an event of default occurs due to the default in payment of principal of, or any premium or interest on, any series of debt securities
issued under the indenture, or due to the default in the performance or

26


-----

**Table of Contents**

breach of any other covenant or warranty of the issuer and/or guarantor, as the case may be, applicable to that series of debt securities but
not applicable to all outstanding debt securities issued under that indenture occurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the holders of not
less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each affected series, voting as one class, by notice in
writing to the issuer and guarantor, as the case may be, may declare the principal of and accrued interest on the debt securities of such
affected series (but not any other debt securities issued under that indenture) to be due and payable immediately;

     - if an event of default occurs due to specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the issuer and/or the guarantor, as the
case may be, the principal of all debt securities and interest accrued on the debt securities to be due and payable immediately; and

     - if an event of default due to a default in the performance of any other of the covenants or agreements in the indenture applicable to all
outstanding debt securities issued under the indenture occurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in
aggregate principal amount of all outstanding debt securities issued under the indenture for which any applicable supplemental indenture
does not prevent acceleration under the relevant circumstances, voting as one class, by notice in writing to the issuer and/or guarantor, as
the case may be, may declare the principal of all debt securities and interest accrued on the debt securities to be due and payable
immediately.

**Annulment of Acceleration and Waiver of Defaults**

In some circumstances, if any and all events of default under the indenture, other than the non-payment of the principal of the securities that has

become due as a result of an acceleration, have been cured, waived or otherwise remedied, then the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of all series of outstanding debt securities affected, voting as one class, may annul past declarations of acceleration or waive past defaults of the debt
securities.

**Indemnification of Trustee for Actions Taken on Your Behalf**

Each indenture provides that the trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance

with the direction of the holders of debt securities issued under that indenture relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the trustee. In addition, each indenture contains a provision entitling
the trustee, subject to the duty of the trustee to act with the required standard of care during a default, to be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by
the holders of debt securities issued under the indenture before proceeding to exercise any right or power at the request of holders. Subject to these
provisions and specified other limitations, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of outstanding debt securities of each
affected series, voting as one class, may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or
exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee.

**Limitation on Actions by You as an Individual Holder**

Each indenture provides that no individual holder of debt securities may institute any action against us under that indenture, except actions for

payment of overdue principal and interest, unless the following actions have occurred:

     - the holder must have previously given written notice to the trustee of the continuing default;

     - the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each affected series, treated as one
class, must have:

         - requested the trustee to institute that action; and

         - offered the trustee reasonable indemnity;

27


-----

**Table of Contents**

     - the trustee must have not instituted that action within 60 days after receipt of the request referred to above; and

     - the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each affected series, voting as one class, must not have
given directions to the trustee inconsistent with those of the holders referred to above.

Each indenture contains a covenant that the issuer and guarantor, if applicable, will file annually with the trustee a certificate of no default or a

certificate specifying any default that exists.

**Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The issuer has the ability to eliminate most or all of its obligations on any series of debt securities prior to maturity if it complies with the

following provisions:

**_Discharge of Indenture. The issuer may discharge all of its obligations, other than as to transfers and exchanges, under the indenture after it has:_**

     - paid or caused to be paid the principal of and interest on all of the outstanding debt securities in accordance with their terms;

     - delivered to the applicable trustee for cancellation all of the outstanding debt securities; or

     - irrevocably deposited with the applicable trustee cash or, in the case of a series of debt securities payable only in U.S. dollars, U.S.
government obligations in trust for the benefit of the holders of any series of debt securities issued under the indenture that have either
become due and payable, or are by their terms due and payable, or are scheduled for redemption, within one year, in an amount certified to
be sufficient to pay on each date that they become due and payable, the principal of and interest on, and any mandatory sinking fund
payments for, those debt securities. However, the deposit of cash or U.S. government obligations for the benefit of holders of a series of
debt securities that are due and payable, or are scheduled for redemption, within one year will discharge obligations under the applicable
indenture relating only to that series of debt securities.

**_Defeasance of a Series of Securities at Any Time. The issuer may also discharge all of its obligations, other than as to transfers and exchanges,_**

under any series of debt securities at any time, which we refer to as defeasance in this prospectus. The issuer may be released with respect to any
outstanding series of debt securities from the obligations imposed by the covenants described above limiting consolidations, mergers, asset sales and
leases, and elect not to comply with those sections without creating an event of default. Discharge under those procedures is called covenant defeasance.

Defeasance or covenant defeasance may be effected only if, among other things:

     - the issuer irrevocably deposits with the relevant trustee cash or, in the case of debt securities payable only in U.S. dollars, U.S. government
obligations, as trust funds in an amount certified to be sufficient to pay on each date that they become due and payable, the principal of and
interest on, and any mandatory sinking fund payments for, all outstanding debt securities of the series being defeased; and

     - the issuer delivers to the relevant trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that:

         - the holders of the series of debt securities being defeased will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income
tax purposes as a result of the defeasance or covenant defeasance;

         - the defeasance or covenant defeasance will not otherwise alter those holders’ United States federal income tax treatment of principal
and interest payments on the series of debt securities being defeased; and

28


-----

**Table of Contents**

         - in the case of a defeasance, this opinion must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or a change in United States
federal income tax law occurring after the date of this prospectus, since that result would not occur under current tax law.

**Modification of the Indenture**

**_Modification without Consent of Holders. The issuer and the relevant trustee may enter into supplemental indentures without the consent of the_**

holders of debt securities issued under each indenture to:

     - secure any debt securities or to confirm and evidence the release of security when such release is permitted under such indenture;

     - evidence the assumption by a successor corporation of our obligations;

     - add covenants for the protection of the holders of debt securities;

     - delete or modify any Events of Default with respect to a new series being established;

     - add or change any provisions of such indenture regarding restrictions on the payment of principal or premium if such modification does
not adversely affect holders of such debt securities in any material respect;

     - change or eliminate any provisions of such indenture if such change or elimination becomes effective when no securities affected are
outstanding;

     - cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or error or correct any inconsistency; or to surrender any right or power of an issuer or
guarantors; or to make such other provisions that shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders in any material respect;

     - establish the forms or terms of debt securities of any series or to authorize the issuance of additional securities of a series;

     - evidence the assumption by the guarantor of all obligations and release of issuer;

     - evidence the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee;

     - supplement such indenture to permit defeasance;

     - add, change or eliminate provisions of such indenture to qualify under the Trust Indenture Act;

     - reduce the minimum denomination of any series;

     - prohibit the authentication and delivery of additional series;

     - add guarantors or co-obligors to a series or to release guarantors in accordance with such indenture;

     - make such provisions as necessary to exchange securities pursuant to a registration rights or similar agreement;

     - conform provisions of such indenture with respect to a series to the provisions of the applicable “Description of Notes”; or

     - make any other change that does not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of holders of such securities.

**_Modification with Consent of Holders. Each issuer and the trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate_**

principal amount of each affected series of outstanding debt securities, voting as one class, may add any provisions to, or change in any manner or
eliminate any of the provisions of, the indenture or modify in any manner the rights of the holders of those debt securities. However, the issuer and the

29


-----

**Table of Contents**

trustee may not make any of the following changes to any outstanding debt security without the consent of each holder that would be affected by the
change:

     - extend the final maturity of the security;

     - reduce the principal amount;

     - reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest;

     - reduce any amount payable on redemption;

     - change the currency in which the principal, including any amount of original issue discount, premium, or interest on the security is
payable;

     - modify or amend the provisions for conversion of any currency into another currency;

     - reduce the amount of any original issue discount security payable upon acceleration or provable in bankruptcy;

     - alter the terms on which holders of the debt securities may convert or exchange debt securities for stock or other securities or for other
property or the cash value of the property, other than in accordance with the antidilution provisions or other similar adjustment provisions
included in the terms of the debt securities;

     - impair the right of any holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on any debt security when due; or

     - reduce the percentage of debt securities the consent of whose holders is required for modification of the Indenture.

**Form of Debt Security**

Each debt security will be represented either by a certificate issued in definitive form to a particular investor or by one or more global securities

representing the entire issuance of securities. Both certificated securities in definitive form and global securities may be issued in registered form, where
the issuer’s obligation runs to the holder of the security named on the face of the security.

Definitive securities name you or your nominee as the owner of the security and in order to transfer or exchange these securities or to receive

payments other than interest or other interim payments, you or your nominee must physically deliver the securities to the trustee, registrar, paying agent
or other agent, as applicable.

Global securities name a depositary or its nominee as the owner of the debt securities represented by these global securities. The depositary

maintains a computerized system that will reflect each investor’s beneficial ownership of the securities through an account maintained by the investor
with its broker/dealer, bank, trust company or other representative, as we explain more fully below.

**Global Securities**

**_Registered Global Securities. The issuer may issue the debt securities in the form of one or more fully registered global securities that will be_**

deposited with a depositary or its nominee identified in the applicable prospectus supplement and registered in the name of that depositary or nominee.
In those cases, one or more registered global securities will be issued in a denomination or aggregate denominations equal to the portion of the aggregate
principal or face amount of the securities to be represented by registered global securities. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole for securities in
definitive registered form, a registered global security may not be transferred except as a whole by and among the depositary for the registered global
security, the nominees of the depositary or any successors of the depositary or those nominees. If not described below, any specific terms of the
depositary arrangement with respect to any securities to be represented by a registered global security will

30


-----

**Table of Contents**

be described in the prospectus supplement relating to those securities. We anticipate that the following provisions will apply to all depositary
arrangements:

Ownership of beneficial interests in a registered global security will be limited to persons, called participants, that have accounts with the

depositary or persons that may hold interests through participants. Upon the issuance of a registered global security, the depositary will credit, on its
book-entry registration and transfer system, the participants’ accounts with the respective principal or face amounts of the securities beneficially owned
by the participants. Any dealers, underwriters or selling agents participating in the distribution of the securities will designate the accounts to be
credited. Ownership of beneficial interests in a registered global security will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership interests will be effected only
through, records maintained by the depositary, with respect to interests of participants, and on the records of participants, with respect to interests of
persons holding through participants. The laws of some states may require that some purchasers of securities take physical delivery of these securities in
definitive form. These laws may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge beneficial interests in registered global securities. So long as the
depositary, or its nominee, is the registered owner of a registered global security, that depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered
the sole owner or holder of the securities represented by the registered global security for all purposes under the applicable indenture.

Except as described below, owners of beneficial interests in a registered global security will not be entitled to have the securities represented by

the registered global security registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the securities in definitive form and
will not be considered the owners or holders of the securities under the applicable indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a
registered global security must rely on the procedures of the depositary for that registered global security and, if that person is not a participant, on the
procedures of the participant through which the person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder under the applicable indenture. We understand
that under existing industry practices, if we request any action of holders or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a registered global security desires to
give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the applicable indenture, the depositary for the registered global security would
authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to give or take that action, and the participants would authorize beneficial owners
owning through them to give or take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners holding through them.

Principal, premium, if any, and interest payments on debt securities represented by a registered global security registered in the name of a

depositary or its nominee will be made to the depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner of the registered global security.
None of the issuer, the guarantor, if applicable, the trustee or any other agent of the issuer, guarantor or agent of the trustee will have any responsibility
or liability for any aspect of the records relating to payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the registered global security or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to those beneficial ownership interests. We expect that the depositary for any of the securities
represented by a registered global security, upon receipt of any payment of principal, premium, interest or other distribution of underlying securities or
other property to holders on that registered global security, will immediately credit participants’ accounts in amounts proportionate to their respective
beneficial interests in that registered global security as shown on the records of the depositary. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of
beneficial interests in a registered global security held through participants will be governed by standing customer instructions and customary practices,
as is now the case with the securities held for the accounts of customers registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of those participants.

If the depositary for any of these securities represented by a registered global security is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depositary

or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and a successor depositary registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act
is not appointed by the issuer within 90 days, the issuer will issue securities in definitive form in exchange for the registered global security that had
been held by the depositary. In addition, the issuer may, at any time and in its sole discretion,

31


-----

**Table of Contents**

decide not to have any of the securities represented by one or more registered global securities. If the issuer makes that decision, it will issue securities
in definitive form in exchange for all of the registered global security or securities representing those securities. Any securities issued in definitive form
in exchange for a registered global security will be registered in the name or names that the depositary gives to the relevant trustee or other relevant
agent of ours or theirs. It is expected that the depositary’s instructions will be based upon directions received by the depositary from participants with
respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the registered global security that had been held by the depositary.

**Guarantees**

Teva will fully and unconditionally guarantee payment in full to the holders of the debt securities issued by the finance subsidiaries pursuant to

this prospectus. The guarantee is set forth in, and forms part of, the finance subsidiary indenture under which the debt securities will be issued. If, for
any reason, the issuer does not make any required payment in respect of its debt securities when due, the guarantor will cause the payment to be made to
or to the order of the trustee. The guarantee will be on a senior basis when the guaranteed debt securities are issued under the senior indenture, and on a
subordinated basis to the extent the guaranteed debt securities are issued under the subordinated indenture. The extent to which the guarantee is
subordinated to other indebtedness of the guarantor will be substantially the same as the extent to which the subordinated debt issued by the issuer is
subordinated to the other indebtedness of the issuer as described below under “—Subordination of the Subordinated Debt Securities.” The holder of the
guaranteed security may sue the guarantor to enforce its rights under the guarantee without first suing any other person or entity.

**Subordination of the Subordinated Debt Securities**

Subordinated debt securities issued by an issuer will, to the extent set forth in the applicable subordinated indenture, be subordinate in right of

payment to the prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the issuer, whether outstanding at the date of the subordinated indenture or incurred
after that date. In the event of:

     - any insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding, or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar case or proceeding in
connection therewith, relative to the issuer or to its creditors, as such, or to its assets; or

     - any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the issuer, whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy;
or

     - any assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of assets and liabilities of the issuer, then the holders of senior
indebtedness of the issuer will be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of all its senior
indebtedness, or provision will be made for the payment in cash, before the holders of the subordinated debt securities of the issuer are
entitled to receive or retain any payment on account of principal of, or any premium or interest on, or any additional amounts with respect
to, the subordinated debt securities. The holders of senior indebtedness of the issuer will be entitled to receive, for application to the
payment of the senior indebtedness, any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, including
any payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the issuer being
subordinated to the payment of its subordinated debt securities. This payment may be payable or deliverable in respect of its subordinated
debt securities in any case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up event.

By reason of subordination, in the event of liquidation or insolvency of the issuer, holders of senior indebtedness of the issuer and holders of other

obligations of the issuer that are not subordinated to its senior indebtedness may recover more ratably than the holders of subordinated debt securities of
the issuer.

Subject to the payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the issuer, the rights of the holders of subordinated debt securities of the issuer will be

subrogated to the rights of the holders of its senior indebtedness

32


-----

**Table of Contents**

to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the issuer applicable to its senior indebtedness until the principal of, any premium
and interest on, and any additional amounts with respect to, its subordinated debt securities have been paid in full.

No payment of principal, including redemption and sinking fund payments, of, or any premium or interest on, or any additional amounts with

respect to the subordinated debt securities of the issuer, or payments to acquire these securities, other than pursuant to their conversion, may be made:

     - if any senior indebtedness of the issuer is not paid when due and any applicable grace period with respect to the default has ended and the
default has not been cured or waived or ceased to exist; or

     - if the maturity of any senior indebtedness of the issuer has been accelerated because of a default.

The subordinated indentures do not limit or prohibit the issuer from incurring additional senior indebtedness, which may include indebtedness that

is senior to its subordinated debt securities, but subordinate to the issuer’s other obligations.

The subordinated indentures provide that these subordination provisions, insofar as they relate to any particular issue of subordinated debt

securities by the issuer, may be changed prior to the issuance. Any change would be described in the applicable prospectus supplement.

**New York Law to Govern**

The indentures and the debt securities will be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

**Information Concerning the Trustee**

The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee under the indenture, has been appointed by us as paying agent, conversion agent, registrar and custodian

with regard to the debt securities. The trustee or its affiliates may from time to time in the future provide banking and other services to us in the ordinary
course of their business.

**DESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTS**

Teva may issue purchase contracts for the purchase or sale of debt or equity securities issued by Teva, a basket of such securities, an index or

indices of such securities or any combination of the above as specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.

Each purchase contract will entitle the holder thereof to purchase or sell, and obligate us to sell or purchase, on specified dates, such securities at a

specified purchase price, which may be based on a formula, all as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. The applicable prospectus
supplement will also specify the methods by which the holders may purchase or sell such securities and any acceleration, cancellation or termination
provisions or other provisions relating to the settlement of a purchase contract and any security arrangements or requirements with respect thereto.
Alternatively, if provided in the applicable prospectus supplement, purchase contracts may require holders to satisfy their obligations thereunder when
the purchase contracts are issued. Any purchase contracts we issue will be physically settled by delivery of our ordinary shares or other securities to
which they relate. Teva’s obligation to settle such pre-paid purchase contacts on the relevant settlement date may constitute indebtedness. Accordingly,
pre-paid purchase contracts will be issued under either the senior indenture or the subordinated indenture.

**Table of Contents**

**DESCRIPTION OF UNITS**

As specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, Teva may issue units consisting of one or more purchase contracts, debt securities, ordinary

shares, ADSs or any combination of such securities. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe:

     - the terms of the units and of the purchase contracts, debt securities, ordinary shares and/or ADSs comprising the units, including whether
and under what circumstances the securities comprising the units may be traded separately;

     - a description of the terms of any unit agreement governing the units; and

     - a description of the provisions for the payment, settlement, transfer or exchange of the units.

**Table of Contents**

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

We may sell our securities in any one or more of the following ways from time to time:

     - to or through underwriters;

     - to or through dealers;

     - through agents; or

     - directly to purchasers, including our affiliates.

The prospectus supplement with respect to any offering of our securities will set forth the terms of the offering, including:

     - the name or names of any underwriters, dealers or agents;

     - the purchase price of the securities and the proceeds to us from the sale;

     - any underwriting discounts and commissions or agency fees and other items constituting underwriters’ or agents’ compensation; and

     - any delayed delivery arrangements.

The distribution of the securities may be effected from time to time in one or more transactions at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed,

at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to the prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.

If securities are sold by means of an underwritten offering, we will execute an underwriting agreement with an underwriter or underwriters, and

the names of the specific managing underwriter or underwriters, as well as any other underwriters, and the terms of the transaction, including
commissions, discounts and any other compensation of the underwriters and dealers, if any, will be set forth in the prospectus supplement which will be
used by the underwriters to sell the securities. If underwriters are utilized in the sale of the securities, the securities will be acquired by the underwriters
for their own account and may be resold from time to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated transactions, at fixed public offering prices
or at varying prices determined by the underwriters at the time of sale.

The securities to be sold by us may be offered to the public either through underwriting syndicates represented by managing underwriters or

directly by the managing underwriters. If any underwriter or underwriters are utilized in the sale of the securities, unless otherwise indicated in the
prospectus supplement, the underwriting agreement will provide that the obligations of the underwriters are subject to conditions precedent and that the
underwriters with respect to a sale of securities will be obligated to purchase all of those securities if they purchase any of those securities.

We may grant to the underwriters options to purchase additional securities to cover over-allotments, if any, at the public offering price with

additional underwriting discounts or commissions. If we grant any over-allotment option, the terms of any over-allotment option will be set forth in the
prospectus supplement relating to those securities.

If a dealer is utilized in the sales of securities in respect of which this prospectus is delivered, we will sell those securities to the dealer as

principal. The dealer may then resell those securities to the public at varying prices to be determined by the dealer at the time of resale. Any reselling
dealer may be deemed to be an underwriter, as the term is defined in the Securities Act, of the securities so offered and sold. The name of the dealer and
the terms of the transaction will be set forth in the related prospectus supplement.

Offers to purchase securities may be solicited by agents designated by us from time to time. Any agent involved in the offer or sale of the

securities in respect of which this prospectus is delivered will be named, and

37


-----

**Table of Contents**

any commissions payable by us to the agent will be set forth, in the applicable prospectus supplement. Unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus
supplement, any agent will be acting on a reasonable best efforts basis for the period of its appointment. Any agent may be deemed to be an underwriter,
as that term is defined in the Securities Act, of the securities so offered and sold.

Offers to purchase securities may be solicited directly by us and the sale of those securities may be made by us directly to institutional investors or

others, who may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act with respect to any resale of those securities. The terms of any
sales of this type will be described in the related prospectus supplement.

Underwriters, dealers, agents and remarketing firms may be entitled under relevant agreements entered into with us to indemnification by us

against certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, that may arise from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in this prospectus, any supplement or amendment hereto, or in the Registration
Statement of which this prospectus forms a part, or to contribution with respect to payments which the agents, underwriters or dealers may be required
to make.

If so indicated in the prospectus supplement, we will authorize underwriters or other persons acting as our agents to solicit offers by institutions to

purchase securities from us pursuant to contracts providing for payments and delivery on a future date. Institutions with which contracts of this type may
be made include commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies, educational and charitable institutions and
others, but in all cases those institutions must be approved by us. The obligations of any purchaser under any contract of this type will be subject to the
condition that the purchase of the securities shall not at the time of delivery be prohibited under the laws of the jurisdiction to which the purchaser is
subject. The underwriters and other persons acting as our agents will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or performance of those
contracts.

One or more firms, referred to as “remarketing firms,” may also offer or sell the securities, if the prospectus supplement so indicates, in

connection with a remarketing arrangement upon their purchase. Remarketing firms will act as principals for their own accounts or as agents for Teva or
any of its subsidiaries. These remarketing firms will offer or sell the securities in accordance with a redemption or repayment pursuant to the terms of
the securities. The prospectus supplement will identify any remarketing firm and the terms of its agreement, if any, with Teva or any of its subsidiaries
and will describe the remarketing firm’s compensation. Remarketing firms may be deemed to be underwriters in connection with the securities they
remarket. Remarketing firms may be entitled under agreements that may be entered into with Teva or any of its subsidiaries to indemnification by Teva
or any of its subsidiaries against certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and may engage in transactions with or perform
services for Teva or any of its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business.

Disclosure in the prospectus supplement of our use of delayed delivery contracts will include the commission that underwriters and agents

soliciting purchases of the securities under delayed contracts will be entitled to receive in addition to the date when we will demand payment and
delivery of the securities under the delayed delivery contracts. These delayed delivery contracts will be subject only to the conditions that we describe in
the prospectus supplement.

Any ADSs will be listed on the NYSE, but any other securities may or may not be listed on a national securities exchange. In connection with the

offering of securities, persons participating in the offering, such as any underwriters, may purchase and sell securities in the open market. These
transactions may include over-allotment and stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover syndicate short positions created in connection with the
offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of bids or purchases for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the securities,
and syndicate short positions involve the sale by underwriters of a greater number of securities than they are required to purchase from any issuer in the
offering. Underwriters also

38


-----

**Table of Contents**

may impose a penalty bid, whereby selling concessions allowed to syndicate members or other broker-dealers in respect of the securities sold in the
offering for their account may be reclaimed by the syndicate if the securities are repurchased by the syndicate in stabilizing or covering transactions.
These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the securities, which may be higher than the price that might prevail in
the open market, and these activities, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.

**ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**


Teva is organized under the laws of Israel and certain of Teva’s directors and officers reside outside of the United States. As a result, service of

process on them may be difficult to effect in the United States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of Teva’s assets are located outside of the United
States. Therefore, any judgment obtained in the United States against us or any of our directors and officers may not be collectible within the United
States.

Subject to various time limitations, an Israeli court may declare a judgment rendered by a foreign court in a civil matter, including judgments

awarding monetary or other damages in non civil matters, enforceable if it finds that:

(1) the judgment was rendered by a court which was, according to the foreign country’s law, competent to render it;

(2) the judgment is no longer appealable;

(3) the obligation in the judgment is enforceable according to the rules relating to the enforceability of judgments in Israel and the substance
of the judgment is not contrary to public policy in Israel; and

(4) the judgment can be executed in the state in which it was given.

A foreign judgment will not be declared enforceable by Israeli courts if it was given in a state, the laws of which do not provide for the

enforcement of judgments of Israeli courts (subject to exceptional cases) or if its enforcement is likely to prejudice the sovereignty or security of Israel.
An Israeli court also will not declare a foreign judgment enforceable if it is proven to the Israeli court that:

(1) the judgment was obtained by fraud;

(2) there was no due process;

(3) the judgment was given by a court not competent to render it according to the laws of private international law in Israel;

(4) the judgment conflicts with another judgment that was given in the same matter between the same parties and which is still valid; or

(5) at the time the action was brought to the foreign court a claim in the same matter and between the same parties was pending before a court
or tribunal in Israel.

**_Teva Finance Netherlands II, Teva Finance Netherlands III and Teva Finance Netherlands IV_**

Each of the Netherlands BVs is organized under the laws of the Netherlands, and its managing directors and supervisory directors reside outside

the United States, and all or a significant portion of the assets of such person may be, and substantially all of the assets of each the Netherlands BVs are,
located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States upon any of the Netherlands
BVs or any such person or to enforce against any of the Netherlands BVs or any such person judgments obtained in United States courts predicated
upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

The United States and the Netherlands do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil

and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil
liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the United States, would not be directly enforceable in the Netherlands.

43


-----

**Table of Contents**

If the party in whose favor such a final judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in the Netherlands, that party may submit to

Dutch court the final judgment that has been rendered in the United States.

A Dutch court will generally grant the same judgment without re-litigation on the merits if:

(1) that judgment results from legal proceedings compatible with Dutch notions of due process;

(2) that judgment does not contravene public policy of the Netherlands; and

(3) the jurisdiction of the relevant federal or state court in the United States has been based on internationally accepted principles of
international civil law.

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors should be able to enforce in

the Netherlands final judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, it is doubtful whether a Dutch
court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. securities
laws.
