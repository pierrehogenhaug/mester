1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,150,OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES,150.1,€605.0 million 5.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2026,150.1.1,,"Centurion Bidco S.p.A., a società per azioni incorporated under the laws of Italy (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) €605.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”). The gross proceeds from the Offering will be used, together with the proceeds from the New Term Loan (as defined herein) and cash on the Issuer’s balance sheet, to repay in full and cancel the indebtedness incurred under the Bridge Facilities (as defined herein), including accrued interest thereon, and pay fees and expenses in connection with the Offering and the incurrence of the New Term Loan. The amounts drawn under the Bridge Facilities were used, together with the Shareholder Funding (as defined herein), to (i) pay the purchase price for the acquisition by the Issuer, of Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A., a società per azioni incorporated under the laws of Italy (the “Company”), on July 23, 2020 (the “Acquisition”), (ii) together with cash on the balance sheet of the Company, repay in full and cancel the Refinanced Company Indebtedness (as defined herein), (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Acquisition, the Financing (as defined herein), the Refinancing (as defined herein) and the entry into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (as defined herein), and (iv) fund cash to the Company’s balance sheet for general corporate purposes. See “Summary—The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.” The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes at a rate of 5.875% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on each March 31 and September 30, commencing on March 31, 2021. Prior to September 30, 2022, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or any portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, plus a “make whole” premium. In addition, prior to September 30, 2022, the Issuer may redee m up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Notes issued) in each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding, the date of redemption. Furthermore, prior to September 30, 2022, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this Offering Memorandum, provided that, inter alia, at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding. At any time on or after September 30, 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum. The Notes will mature on September 30, 2026. In addition, in the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may elect to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any. In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw the Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders of Notes, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes in such offer. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase all the outstanding Notes, at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” We intend to use commercially reasonable efforts to merge the Issuer with the Company in accordance with applicable provisions of Italian law and as further described herein, with MergerCo (as defined herein) being the surviving entity (the “Post-Completion Merger”) as soon as reasonably practicable during the twelve months following the Issue Date. The Post-Completion Merger is subject to certain conditions and may not be completed. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security Interests—We may be unable to complete the Post-Completion _Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.”_ The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank _pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) and the New Term Loan. Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and will not be guaranteed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Issue Date, the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company to implement the Whitewash Procedure (as defined herein) and guarantee the Notes on a senior secured basis as soon as reasonably practicable following the approval of the annual financial statements of the Company for the financial year ending December 31, 2020 and in any event prior to the date falling eighteen months following the Issue Date, provided that this undertaking shall no longer apply following consummation of the Post-Completion Merger. The Whitewash Procedure is subject to certain conditions and significant limitations under applicable Italian law and there is no assurance that it will be completed. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the _Collateral—Once granted, the Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.” The Company will use_ commercially reasonable efforts to guarantee the New Term Loan on the same date as, and on a pari passu basis with, the Notes. The Company will also guarantee our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility on or prior to the date on which the Company provides its Guarantee (as defined herein) under the Indenture (as defined herein), to the extent applicable. In particular, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Acquisition Closing Date, the Company is expected to provide a guarantee in respect of its obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement within thirty Business Days from the first anniversary of the Acquisition Closing Date, whereas the Company will not be required to provide its Guarantee until the date falling eighteen months following the Issue Date. Prior to the Post-Completion Merger and, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Issue Date, prior to the granting of the Guarantee by the Company, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issue r (including the Company). After the granting of the Guarantee by the Company (and subject to any limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Company. After the Post-Completion Merger, none of MergerCo’s subsidiaries is expected to guarantee the Notes, and the Notes will therefore be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of MergerCo. On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Issue Date Collateral (as defined herein). Within ten Business Days from (and excluding) the Merger Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Post-Merger Collateral (as defined herein). In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Issue Date, within twenty Business Days following the issuance by the Company of its Guarantee, the Notes will also be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, by the Company Collateral (as defined herein). Each of the Issue Date Collateral, the Post-Merger Collateral and (if applicable) the Company Collateral is further described under “Description of the Notes—Security.” The Collateral (as defined herein) will also secure the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations (if any) and the New Term Loan on a _pari passu_ basis. In the event that the PostCompletion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Acquisition Closing Date, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is expected to be secured by the Company Collateral within thirty Business Days from the date falling twelve months after the Acquisition Closing Date, whereas the Company Collateral will only be required to be granted in relation to the Notes and the New Term Loan within twenty Business Days following the issuance by the Company of its Guarantee. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), and subject to applicable laws, in the event of an enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will be treated as pari passu among each other, although they will receive proceeds from such Collateral (x) only after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full and (y) on a pari passu basis with the lender under the New Term Loan. In addition, subject to applicable laws, the Guarantee and the security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, and to applicable laws, the Collateral may be pledged to secure future indebtedness. The Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.” See also “Risk Factors—Risk s _Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—Once granted, the Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement” and “Description of the Notes— Security.”_ This Offering Memorandum includes more detailed information on the terms of the Notes and the Guarantee, including redemption and repurchase prices, security, covenants, events of default and transfer restrictions. Subject to and as set forth in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer will not be liable to pay any Additional Amounts to holders of the Notes in relation to any withholding or deduction required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996, as amended or supplemented from time to time (“Decree No. 239”), if the Notes are held by a person resident in a country that is not included in the list issued under Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239, and otherwise in the circumstances as described in “Description of the Notes—Withholding _Taxes.”_ There is currently no market for the Notes. This Offering Memorandum constitutes a prospectus for purposes of Part IV of the Luxembourg law on prospectuses for securities dated July 16, 2019. Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and to admit the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those expected in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in “Risk Factors.” In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

In drafting this Offering Memorandum, we used industry sources, market research, publicly available information, industry publications and sources of market data, such as reports prepared by Gartner, Inc. (“Gartner”), the Anitec-Assinform Italian Association for Information and Communication Technology (“Anitec-Assinform”), the Italian National Institute of Statistics (“ISTAT”), the Statistical Office of the European Union (“EUROSTAT”) and the World Bank. To the extent that information was taken from third parties, such information has been accurately reproduced by us in this Offering Memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information published by these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Market studies and analyses are, however, frequently based on information and assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct, and their methodology may be forward-looking and speculative. We have not verified the figures, market data and other information used by third parties in the studies, publications and financial information reproduced herein, or the external sources on which our estimates are based. We therefore assume no liability for and offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data from studies and third party sources contained in this Offering Memorandum or for the accuracy of third party data on which our estimates are based.

Throughout this Offering Memorandum, we present our combined market share for our Health and Public Administration industry verticals in a Public Administration and Health industry vertical. In addition, throughout this Offering Memorandum, we present our market share by industry vertical only for Implementation activities, which contributed the vast majority of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition to Implementation activities, we also engage in Application Managed Services and other niche activities. This Offering Memorandum also contains estimates of market data and information derived from such data that cannot be obtained from publications by independent sources. Such information is partly based on our own market observations, the evaluation of industry information (such as from conferences and sector events) or internal assessments. We believe that our estimates of market data and the information we have derived from such data helps investors to better understand the industry in which we operate and our position within it. Our own estimates have not been checked or verified externally.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer is a holding company with no revenue-generating activities of its own, and no business operations, material assets, other than the shares it holds in the Company and its receivables under the Funding Loan, or material liabilities, other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions, including indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions. As a result, no financial information of the Issuer is included in this Offering Memorandum, except for certain limited “as adjusted” financial data presented on a consolidated basis as adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions. Prior to the Post-Completion Merger, the Issuer is currently not expected to engage in any activities other than those related to the Transactions and any other future potential transactions permitted by the Indenture. All historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Group” in respect of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. This Offering Memorandum includes English translations of: (i) our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2020, which include unaudited comparative financial data for the six months ended June 30, 2019, prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (the “Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements”); and (ii) our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS (the “Audited Financial Statements” and, together with the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Financial Statements”). Our Audited Financial Statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche S.p.A. On December 6, 2019, in order to reorganize and simplify the corporate structure of the Group, two parent entities of the Company, Mic Newco S.p.A. and Mic Holdco S.r.l., were combined with the Company in a reverse merger. The Company did not recognize any additional goodwill in connection with these transactions and accounted for the assets and liabilities of the two parent entities in accordance with the principle of continuity of book value. For further information, see note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In the future, we will report our financial results in respect of periods following the Acquisition Closing Date but prior to the Merger Date to holders of the Notes at the level of the Issuer in accordance with IFRS. Following the Post-Completion Merger, we will report our financial results in respect of periods following the Merger Date to holders of the Notes at the level of MergerCo in accordance with IFRS. Our consolidated financial statements in this Offering Memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statements, statements of financial position or cash flow statements that might occur as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the Transactions. However, the Issuer (prior to the Merger Date) and MergerCo (following the Merger Date), as applicable, will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS and will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Acquisition to the financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Acquisition Closing Date. The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and liabilities and we may add additional assets to our statement of financial position, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, brand name, customer relationships, leasehold rights and software. We may also recognize different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— _Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations.”_ In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and how those differences could affect the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. xx ----- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the board of directors to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to our financial statements, are disclosed in our Financial Statements.

Between January 1, 2017 and June 30, 2020, we acquired majority stakes in, or the entire capital stock of, 21 companies (excluding transactions in which we only increased our stake in previously consolidated companies). In particular, we completed 11 acquisitions in 2017, 5 acquisitions in 2018 and 4 acquisitions in 2019 and one acquisition in the six months ended June 30, 2020. Due to the changes in our scope of consolidation as a consequence of each of such acquisitions, our results of operations in the periods under review may not be entirely comparable. For further information, see “Management’s Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Acquisitions.”_ In our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, the comparative financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 was restated to reflect the completion of the purchase price allocation to goodwill and net identifiable assets acquired in relation to certain business combinations that occurred in 2017. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Acquisitions.”_ Therefore, the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 included and discussed in this Offering Memorandum is that presented as comparative information in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 which was not covered by the audit report included therein.

1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,363,GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMS,363.5,Changes in Accounting Standards and Accounting Policies,363.5.1,,"On January 1, 2019, we adopted IFRS 16—Leases (“IFRS 16”). IFRS 16 was applied using the modified retrospective approach and the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard was recognized at the date of initial application, being January 1, 2019. The transition to IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019, gave rise to changes to our assets and liabilities. As of January 1, 2019, our right-of-use assets amounted to €162.0 million and lease liabilities amounted to €162.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, our right-of-use assets amounted to xxii ----- €173.4 million and lease liabilities amounted to €174.8 million. The depreciation of right-of-use assets for the year ended December 31, 2019, amounted to €20.0 million and the interest expense on lease liabilities amounted to €1.5 million. As of June 30, 2020, our right-of-use assets amounted to €167.2 million and our lease liabilities amounted to €169.8 million. The depreciation of right-of-use assets for the six months ended June 30, 2020, amounted to €9.9 million and the interest expense on lease liabilities amounted to €0.8 million. The positive impact of the implementation of IFRS 16 on our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to €20.3 million. For more information, refer to our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 have not been restated for the application of IFRS 16. Instead, those financial statements applied IAS 17, which was the accounting standard in effect at that time. Therefore, due to the adoption of IFRS 16 and the associated accounting policies changes applied, our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 are not directly comparable with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 included and discussed in this Offering Memorandum is presented without giving effect to the application of IFRS 16 (Leases) while Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019, the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 included in this Offering Memorandum is presented after giving effect to the application of IFRS 16 (Leases). As a result, Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 is not directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019, the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. In addition, on January 1, 2018, we adopted IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement). IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 were applied using the modified retrospective approach and therefore the retained earnings as of January 1, 2018 was adjusted to reflect this change for the application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15. For more information, refer to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,363,GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMS,363.7,Non-IFRS Measures,363.7.1,,"In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. We refer to these measures as “non-IFRS measures” as they xxiii ----- exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with IFRS. In particular, we present certain financial measures of the Group and ratios related thereto in this Offering Memorandum, including: organic revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, capital expenditure, net working capital, adjusted net working capital, free operating cash flow and cash conversion and other measures and ratios that are not recognized by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS (collectively, the “Non-IFRS Measures”). We use such measures to assess the financial performance and liquidity of our business. We believe that these and similar measures are used widely by the investment community, securities analysts and other interested parties, as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity and are intended to assist in the analysis of our results of operations, profitability and ability to service debt. Non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Group’s operating results as reported under IFRS. An explanation of the relevance of each of the non-IFRS measures, a reconciliation of the non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and a discussion of their limitations is set out in this Offering Memorandum. See “Summary Historical and Certain _Other Financial Data.” We do not regard these non-IFRS measures as a substitute for, or superior to, the_ equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS or those calculated using financial measures that are calculated in accordance with IFRS. Our primary Non-IFRS Measures are defined as follows: - “Organic revenue growth” is defined as the percentage growth in Group revenue between two periods (the later of such periods, the “subsequent period”), excluding from the subsequent period the contribution to the Group’s revenues by entities that were acquired by the Group during such period; - “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net profit from continuing operations before income taxes, financial income, income from investments, financial expenses (excluding interests on lease liabilities), interests on lease liabilities (only following the implementation of IFRS 16 as of and from January 1, 2019 and not for periods prior to such date), depreciation of property, plant and equipment, depreciation of right of use assets, amortization of intangible assets, provision and impairments of assets, and further adjusted for the effects of certain events and transactions that management considers to be unrelated to our underlying trading performance, including stock option costs, retirement incentives, costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters, non-income tax assessment costs and corporate strategic assessment expenses. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it is widely used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the profitability of companies. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net finance costs), tax positions (such as the availability of net operating losses against which to relieve taxable profits), the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense), the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense) and other items not considered by management to relate to the Group’s underlying operations; - “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenues, expressed as a percentage; - “Capital expenditure” is defined as purchase of property, plant and equipment plus purchase of intangible assets. Capital expenditure excludes the consideration paid by us for the acquisition of other businesses; - “Net Working Capital” is defined as current customer contract assets, inventories, deferred contract costs, trade receivables and other current assets less current trade payables, other current liabilities, current tax payables and current provisions for risks and charges; - “Adjusted net working capital” is defined as Net working capital, as adjusted for certain effects that management does not consider representative of the ongoing operations of the Group; - “Free operating cash flow” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital expenditure less change in Adjusted net working capital less IFRS 16 impact; and - “Cash conversion” is defined as (x) Adjusted EBITDA less Capital expenditure divided by (y) Adjusted EBITDA, expressed as a percentage. xxiv ----- The Non-IFRS Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to performance or liquidity measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. An explanation of the relevance of each of the Non-IFRS Measures, a reconciliation of the Non-IFRS Measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and a discussion of their limitations is set out in this Offering Memorandum under “Summary Historical and Certain Other Financial Data.” The Non-IFRS Measures are not measures of financial performance recognized under IFRS and they should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as measures of operating performance, operating cash flows, the basis for dividend distribution or as measures of liquidity. Consequently, the methodology used for their calculation may not be consistent with that adopted by other companies and, therefore, the Non-IFRS Measures we present herein may not be comparable with those of others. Some of the limitations of Non-IFRS Measures are that: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and - other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, the Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations or as measures of performance in order to assist in the analysis of our operating results, profitability. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our Financial Statements and using these Non-IFRS Measures only as a supplement to evaluate our performance. Please see “Summary _Historical and Certain Other Financial Data,” “Selected Historical Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Financial Statements_ (including the related notes), included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this Offering Memorandum are derived from management estimates, are not part of our Financial Statements or our accounting records, and have not been audited or otherwise reviewed by outside auditors, consultants or experts. Our use or computation of these measures may not be comparable to the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Any or all of these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of performance under IFRS.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are the leading specialist provider of IT services, software and digital solutions in Italy, with a market share of approximately 10% in Implementation and 7% in Application Managed Services, in each case calculated in terms of U.S. dollars and revenue, in 2019, according to Gartner (Gartner, Market Share: IT Services Worldwide 2019, April 2020). We provide a holistic suite of leading software and digital solutions to more than 1,700 corporate and public administration customers and focus on supporting our customers in digital transformation projects. We couple new and advanced digital enabling capabilities, including artificial intelligence (“AI”) and advanced analytics, cloud-based services, cybersecurity, IoT, robotic process automation, AR / MR / VR, blockchain and digital twin platforms, with a strong know-how of traditional technological solutions and an intimate knowledge of our broad client base’s core processes. In the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 54% of our revenue-generating projects incorporated digital enabling technologies. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we generated revenues of €1,250.6 million, consolidated profit of €54.8 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of €183.1 million. We operate in the attractive and growing Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets which, according to Anitec-Assinform, grew at a CAGR of approximately 6.3% between 2017 and 2019, and were worth approximately €20 billion in 2019. These markets benefit from strong ongoing digitalization across the Italian public and private sectors and increasing spending in transformation projects from traditional IT to new digital enabling technologies. Our leading position in the Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets, coupled with our deep local and regional market knowledge and long-lasting relationships with our customers and partners, uniquely positions us to capitalize on the strong growth in demand for IT transformation services in Italy, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.3% between 2020 and 2022, according to Anitec-Assinform. We offer our IT services, software and digital platforms and solutions to our customers by engaging in three distinct types of activities: (i) Proprietary Solutions, (ii) Application Transformation and (iii) Managed Services. In particular: - **Proprietary Solutions: We offer a wide range of cutting-edge software and digital solutions (including AI, cloud-based services, IoT, AR / MR / VR, digital twin and blockchain platforms) and related services primarily to customers in our Finance, Energy & Utilities, Public Administration, Telco & Media and Health verticals. Our Proprietary Solutions relate to four main software suites, and a longer tail of approximately 25 smaller products, all developed in-house and owned by us. Our Proprietary Solutions comprise end-to-end service partnerships with certain of our customers through which we provide tailored digital service packages which also include Application Transformation services and Managed Services. We estimate that, in 2019, we were one of the leading providers of governance, risk and compliance reporting software for financial institutions, field service management solutions, CRM solutions and billing platforms for utilities providers and healthcare ERP solutions for hospitals in Italy based on revenue. Excluding €59.4 million of total revenues unallocated by type of activity, we generated 45% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019 from our activities related to Proprietary Solutions. - **Application Transformation: We develop and customize state-of-the-art IT services, software and digital solutions such as cloud migration, cybersecurity, ERP evolution, SAP HANA migrations, AI 1 ----- and advanced analytics. We are a leading service provider and system integrator in Italy, customizing and developing third-party digital-enabled IT solutions for providers such as SAP, Microsoft, Salesforce and Oracle, and advanced digital enabling capabilities (e.g., cybersecurity, AI and AR / MR / VR) together with our partners, including Tibco, Google and AWS. We also run third-party applications (providing updates, maintenance and support) as part of our Application Transformation activities. We generated 43% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019 from our activities related to Application Transformation. - **Managed Services: Our Managed Services comprise the day-to-day management and operation of end-to-end processes and infrastructures through innovative IT solutions, such as hybrid, multi-cloudbased services, robotic process automation, next generation service desks with chatbots and digital agents, as well as various digital workplace solutions. We generated 12% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019 from our activities related to Managed Services. We are present in all regions and most metropolitan cities in Italy (including Milan, Rome and Turin) and operate across several sectors of the economy, including public administration, financial services, utilities, telecommunications, transportation, infrastructure and healthcare. In particular, we operate each of our activity types across six industry verticals, which correspond to our reporting segments under IFRS 8 (Operating _Segments) and represent the verticals or strategic markets in which we operate, with industry-specific knowledge_ supported technologies and competences. Our six industry verticals are Finance, Health, Industry & Services, Telco & Media, Energy & Utilities and Public Administration.

Our customers include more than 1,700 large private and blue chip companies and public sector bodies, among which are six of the largest Italian banks (including Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit, Banco BPM and UBI Banca), major telecommunications companies (including Vodafone and Telecom Italia (“TIM”)), utilities companies (including Enel and Eni), manufacturing companies (including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (“FCA”)), healthcare organizations (including the Veneto Healthcare System and the majority of hospitals in Italy) and transportation and infrastructure companies (including Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane). In 2019 we worked on approximately 16,600 individual IT services, software and digital solutions contracts which were distributed amongst our customers. We seek to create long-term, strategic relationships with our customers, and aim to be viewed as an integral part of their businesses. We have historically been able to achieve long-lasting, integral customer relationships by creating significantly customized and highly specialized products and services that we integrate into our end-customers’ IT systems. Our average relationship tenure with customers is approximately ten years. Our business benefits from low customer concentration and significant customer diversification across all of our industry verticals, with no customer accounting for more than 8% of our revenue and no industry vertical accounting for more than 22% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2019. In the same period, our top ten customers generated 34% of our revenue. We believe our success and leading position in the Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets is largely dependent on our strong focus on R&D, and we invested approximately €27 million in R&D in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our R&D activities rely on a dedicated team of researchers and data scientists. Our 2 ----- R&D Lab works closely with other units of the company, which include an Innovators Network, Development _Labs, internal Competence Centers and Products Labs._ We believe our business model has allowed us to quickly respond to and continue to efficiently operate our business during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, during the Italy-wide lockdown in March, April and May 2020, we were able to continue to ensure business continuity and service our clients while safeguarding the health and safety of our employees. We successfully transitioned substantially all of our employees to remote working over a short period of time, maintaining high levels of service and assisting our clients with their responses to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, including in connection with digital transformation projects, digital workplace solutions, cybersecurity, cloud-based solutions and business continuity solutions that have all seen increased demand as a result of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and that we expect will continue to see increased demand going forward. As of today, we have an average of 6,800 employees per day working remotely. See “—Recent Developments—COVID-19 Update,” “Industry and Market Overview— _Preliminary considerations on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and results of operations.”_",N/A,as_expected,2020,725
1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.1,Leading player in the attractive Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets with strong growth driven by digital transformation secular trend,"The Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets grew at a CAGR of approximately 6.3% between 2017 and 2019, significantly outperforming overall Italian GDP growth, which grew at a CAGR of 1.1% over the same period, and were worth approximately €20 billion in 2019. In addition, the Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets are forecast to grow at a CAGR of 7.3% between 2020 and 2022 mainly driven by (i) increasing penetration of the Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets, (ii) digitalization across all private and public clients, and increasing spending in transformation projects from traditional IT to new digital enabling technologies and (iii) increasingly mission critical nature of IT services spending. The Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets have historically been, and remain, underpenetrated compared to the equivalent markets in other European countries, and in the year ended December 31, 2019, IT services spend in Italy as a percentage of GDP amounted to 0.7% compared to the European average of 1.1%, according to management estimates, which we believe provides us with opportunities for significant further growth. The increasing penetration of IT services in Italy is expected to accelerate as the Italian government and regulators implement policies that favor digitalization through IT investments, such as the Industry 4.0 plan and the National Plan for Innovation 2025, and as Italian companies increase their spending on IT services to accelerate their competitive advantage and keep pace with the global trench towards digitalization. We believe that growth in the Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets is mainly driven by strong ongoing digitalization across the Italian public and private sectors, with increased IT services spending on and diversified growth of new digital enabling technologies, such as (i) IoT (which is expected to grow by approximately 12% between 2020 and 2022), (ii) cloud and IaaS services (which are expected to grow by approximately 18% between 2020 and 2022), (iii) big data (which is expected to grow by approximately 13% between 2020 and 2022), (iv) cyber security (which is expected to grow by approximately 11% between 2020 and 2022) and (v) AI (which is expected to grow by approximately 27% between 2020 and 2022), according to Anitec-Assinform. See “Industry and Market Overview.” Additionally, growth in IT services spend is also driven by the increasingly mission-critical nature of IT services in business operations which we expect to result in IT services spend in Italy becoming more resilient in the face of future market downturns and less correlated to macroeconomic trends.

As a result, we believe that these barriers favor local players, thus allowing us to capitalize on our leading positioning in the market for both traditional technologies and digital enabling technologies in Italy, given our deep knowledge of the domestic market and long-lasting relationships with a wide cross-section of Italian customers and partners. Italian customers have also been shown to prefer software and IT services suppliers with whom they share a common language, that have extensive operations in Italy and that have an in-depth know-how of the applicable Italian legal and regulatory framework, which we believe makes entering the Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets more challenging for international players.

The vast majority of revenues generated from our activities related to Proprietary Solutions comes from the sale of software- and product-related services following the initial sale of the software license. Our Proprietary Solutions portfolio enables us to benefit from strong competitive positions in specific niches, particularly within the Finance, Energy & Utilities, Public Administration, Industry & Services and Health verticals. Our proprietary software solutions portfolio includes four software suite and 27 smaller products, including (i) Grace, the leading compliance and risk management software program developed for financial institutions, servicing most major banks in Italy, with a market share estimated to be double that of its closest competitor, (ii) AREAS, one of the largest digital platforms for the digitalization and integration of clinical and administrative healthcare processes in the hospital ERP markets and the second largest in the Italian healthcare IT market, (iii) Geocall, the leading field service management solution by OverIT, (OverIT has been named by Gartner as a “Visionary” in Gartner’s April 2019 Magic Quadrant for Field Service Management), (iv) Net@Suite, the leading cloud-based platform for billing and CRM for all types of sales and distribution operators in the gas and electricity markets, and (v) JEnte, one of the leading software programs for the digitalization of processes of Italian municipalities. Our Proprietary Solutions portfolio targets specific niches across all of our industry verticals that are highly attractive in light of their regulated nature, the need for highly tailored solutions and the elevated costs that customers must bear for switching providers. Furthermore, we believe that the strong reputation of our Proprietary Solutions also allows us to up-sell and cross-sell our Managed Services and Application Transformation services. We supplement our strong software offering across all of our activity types with new and advanced digital enabling capabilities, including AI and advanced analytics, cloud-based services, cybersecurity, IoT, robotic process automation, AR / MR / VR, digital twin and blockchain platforms, and in the year ended December 31, 2019 approximately 54% of our revenue-generating projects incorporated digital enabling technologies, mainly driven by digital transformation projects and advanced proprietary solutions.

Our R&D operations are led by a dedicated team of researchers and data scientists. Our R&D Lab works closely with other units of the company, which include an _Innovators Network, comprising over 200 innovation experts, Development Labs, internal Competence Centers_ and Products Labs. We partner with more than 40 universities globally and have 22 strategic alliances with our global research partner ecosystem, which includes universities, research centers, technology companies and end-user companies. We believe we are among the most active research companies in Europe, attracting funds from national and EU research programs, ranking first among European companies in volume of security-related research projects funded by the EC, according to Anitec-Assinform. We ranked among the top 15 European companies in terms of participation in, and amount of research funding awarded under, the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Programme for Research and Innovation, according to the Publications Office of the European Union. As a result, we are widely recognized as a leader in ICT research and innovation in Europe. In the six months ended June 30, 2020, we received €9.7 million in research funding from Italian and European research programs.

In particular, the revenues we generate from our activities related to Proprietary Solutions, which accounted for approximately 45% of total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019, are highly recurring and demonstrate our long-lasting relationships with our Proprietary Solutions customers primarily as a result of the local, highly specialized and customized nature of our Proprietary Solutions as well as their integration into our end-customers’ IT systems, which also limits competition for our products and services in respect of those customers. In addition, the revenues we generate from our activities related to Managed Services relating to the day-to-day management and operation services of our own infrastructure and data centers and provide to customers individually and in connection with our Proprietary Solutions are secured by long-term contracts. Our Managed Services customers display high retention rates also due to the difficulty of switching to a different provider. Moreover, the revenues we generate from our activities related to Application Transformation are backed by high levels of contract renewals due to our successful track record of service delivery and our knowledge of complex IT systems. The high share of recurring contracts with our existing customers across all of our business lines has allowed us to maintain a stable revenue performance. Moreover, our ability to sell additional services to existing customers allowed us to increase spending of our existing customers over time, thus increasing our revenue generation.

In accordance with the provisions of the Acquisition Agreement, prior to the Acquisition Closing Date Centurion Holdco designated the Issuer as purchaser under the Acquisition Agreement. Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer obtained, among other things, certain antitrust clearances and the authorization of the Acquisition from the presidency of the Italian Council of Ministries (Presidenza del _Consiglio dei Ministri) under Law 56 of May 11, 2012, and the relevant implementing decrees adopted by the_ Italian government and the President of the Italian Republic, and under Law No. 133 of November 18, 2019, all as subsequently amended and supplemented (the “Italian Golden Power Legislation”). The Acquisition was consummated by the Issuer on July 23, 2020. Consideration for the Acquisition consisted of (x) a cash purchase price of €1,336.0 million, which was paid to the Sellers on the Acquisition Closing Date, plus (y) a deferred cash consideration in the amount of €20.0 million, which was paid to the Sellers on August 21, 2020 and was funded by cash available to the Issuer at that time. Additionally, pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, we have agreed to pass on to the Sellers certain amounts relating to (x) receivables from the partial settlement of the litigation against Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. up to a maximum amount of €8.0 million as well as (y) certain additional receivables from the still-pending litigation against Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. up to a maximum amount of €5.9 million, each of which we expect to collect following the Issue Date. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” Concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, members of management of the Company exercised certain stock options pursuant to the Company’s existing management stock option plan at a strike price of €32.9 million. The payment of the strike price was funded by a capital contribution to the Company as part of the Shareholder Funding (as defined below) made by the Issuer on behalf of the Company’s management on the Acquisition Closing Date. Following the exercise of these stock options, the Issuer purchased the shares from management, with the consideration paid by the Issuer to management for the purchase of such shares that was reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the strike price funded by the Issuer on behalf of management. The net consideration for the Company’s shares paid by the Issuer to management was included in the cash consideration for the Acquisition of €1,336.0 million indicated above. See “—The Financing of the Acquisition and the Refinancing” Although the Sellers have given certain customary representations, warranties and indemnities as to, inter _alia, capacity, title and disclosure in the Acquisition Agreement, the Issuer may not be able to enforce claims_ against the Sellers relating to breaches of these representations, warranties and indemnities. In addition, the Sellers’ liability for any breach of a warranty is subject to certain thresholds and limitations. See “Risk Factors— _Risks Related to the Transactions—We may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the representations and warranties that the Sellers have provided to the Issuer under the Acquisition Agreement.”_ As part of the Acquisition, and in accordance with the provisions included in the Shareholder Agreement (as defined herein), the Sponsors expect to allocate a portion of the share capital of Centurion Midco S.à r.l., an indirect parent company of the Issuer, to certain members of our senior management team through a management 11 ----- incentive plan as soon as practicable following the Acquisition Closing Date.

1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.18,Recent Developments,9.18.1,Investigation by Italian Authorities into Tenders Involving Azienda Trasporti Milanesi S.p.A.,"On June 23, 2020, the Company received notice that an investigation was being undertaken by authorities in Italy involving Azienda Trasporti Milanesi S.p.A. (“ATM”), the company wholly owned by the municipality of Milan (Comune di Milano) that manages the Milan metro system, as well as eight other companies, including the Company. The investigation involves allegations that certain public tenders involving ATM were impacted by improper benefits provided by employees of the companies under investigation, including certain employees of the Company. Based on the information currently available to the Company, the events under investigation occurred approximately between September 2018 and April 2019. In connection with the investigation, on June 23, 2020, two employees of the Company were initially taken into custody and two other employees of the Company were placed under house arrest. In relation to such events, the relevant authorities are also investigating the Company as well as the other companies for alleged violations of LD 231/2001, the Italian law on corporate liability for crimes, and in particular corruption, and requested access to certain of the Company’s offices as well as certain documents and records of the Company on June 23, 2020. Furthermore, on July 21, 2020, the Company was informed that three additional employees were subject to the investigation. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the employees under investigation include (i) the head of the Company’s transportation business sub-segment, who was appointed to this position in September 2019, after the occurrence of the events 14 ----- under investigation as well as (ii) six other employees in the transportation sub-segment. None of the employees currently under investigation is a member of the senior management team of the Company. The pretrial hearings for the gathering of evidence before the beginning of the criminal proceeding (incidente probatorio) are currently scheduled for October 2020 but may be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company anticipates that up to two of its employees could provide evidence during these pretrial hearings. At this time, it is not possible to predict when the final verdict, if any, will emerge. Following receipt of the notice of the investigation, the Group promptly informed CONSIP, the Italian Public Procurement Agency, as well as other public and private contracting entities, about the investigation and disclosed the various actions that the Group implemented and/or is in the process of implementing in response to such investigation. Both CONSIP and the other entities which were informed have positively welcomed the Group’s disclosure and as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the investigation has not negatively impacted the Group’s existing contracts with the respective entities. In addition, since the commencement of the investigation, the Group has participated in five public tender procedures launched by CONSIP and, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and the current status of the investigation, the Group has no reason to believe that the investigation will prevent the Group from participating in new tender procedures launched by CONSIP going forward given the Group’s commitment to implementing any relevant remediation or self-cleansing measures upon the results of such investigation. As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, the negative effects of the ongoing investigation on the Company’s business and operations have been limited. In particular, on July 9, 2020, ATM terminated its two existing contracts with the Company and one existing contract with its subsidiary, Engineering 365, which we estimate collectively accounted for approximately €0.7 million of revenues over the last three years. In addition, on September 4, 2020 Metropolitana Milanese S.p.A. (“Metropolitana Milanese”), a company wholly owned by the municipality of Milan (Comune di Milano), excluded the Group from two different tenders relating to (i) workplace and fleet management services (with a total tender value of approximately €2.4 million over 42 months) and (ii) management and evolution services of its ICT applications and infrastructures (with a total tender value of approximately €14.9 million over 63 months). The Group’s overall revenues from ATM, Metropolitana Milanese S.p.A. and the Municipality of Milan (Comune di Milano) are in aggregate not material to the business of the Group. We estimate that for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the Group’s transportation business sub-segment generated less than 5% of the Group’s total revenues, with revenues derived from business from ATM comprising only a very small portion of that amount. We estimate that for the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated approximately €36.6 million of revenues from Metropolitana Milanese S.p.A., which are accounted for in our Energy & Utilities industry vertical. In addition, we estimate that for the same period the overall revenues we generated from the Municipality of Milan (Comune di Milano) were approximately €11.7 million. In addition, the Company has initiated legal proceedings challenging the termination of such contracts by ATM claiming, among other things, that (i) ATM failed to carry out the required evaluation or analysis confirming the Company’s alleged failure to carry out its contractual obligations, (ii) the termination clause used by ATM to terminate the existing contracts was not valid, (iii) the conduct of the Company’s employees subject to the ongoing investigation was not the responsibility of the Company and (iv) ATM failed to take into account the self-cleansing actions undertaken by the Company as well as the lack of a final judgment against the Company in this investigation. Engineering 365 is also in the process of commencing legal proceedings against ATM contesting the termination of its contract with ATM. Furthermore, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Group has formally requested Metropolitana Milanese to reconsider its decision to exclude the Group from the abovementioned tenders and is considering challenging such exclusions before the competent administrative courts should Metropolitana Milanese not reverse its decision, on the basis of, among other things, (i) factual errors in Metropolitana Milanese’s exclusion letter, (ii) the strength of the Company’s compliance and monitoring systems pursuant to its organizational model implemented pursuant to LD 231/2001, and (iii) our ongoing internal audit activities and the internal investigation carried out by our external advisors, including the implementation of any relevant remediation or self-cleansing measures upon the results of such investigation. Apart from the termination of the existing contracts with ATM and the exclusion from the two tenders with Metropolitana Milanese S.p.A. mentioned above, we believe that as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have not experienced any decline in business opportunities, tender wins or contracts in both the public and private sectors as a result of the investigation and we have continued to operate our business in the ordinary course. As part of the investigation, we expect the relevant authorities and the competent courts to review our monitoring systems, including our organizational model pursuant to LD 231/2001 and the related implementing 15 ----- procedures. The Company is undertaking a fulsome internal investigation of the matter and has promptly engaged legal counsel (Ropes & Gray and Gianni Origoni, Grippo, Cappelli & Partners) to assess the claims in the investigation, prepare appropriate responses, and undertake an analysis of the Company’s implementation of the organizational model pursuant to LD 231/2001. Furthermore, the Company’s supervisory board (Organismo _di Vigilanza) carried out its own review of the organizational model pursuant to LD 231/2001, which is also an_ action required by the Italian legal system and protective of the Company’s interests. In addition, the Company is fully cooperating with the relevant authorities. Moreover, in response to the alleged wrongdoing, the Company has placed the four employees who were initially arrested, and who are alleged to be involved in the unlawful activities, on leave, pending further results of the investigation and the Company’s own internal findings. The analysis undertaken over the past months has consisted of interviews with multiple employees of the Group, including relevant members of senior management, a review of thousands of documents and other key information. While certain further steps remain to be completed, the majority of the investigation is complete and investigatory counsel believes that it is unlikely that the remaining steps will result in a material change to the current findings. We believe and have previously been advised that our organizational model pursuant to LD 231/2001 was appropriately implemented. If we were held responsible for criminal activities carried out by certain of our employees or violations of relevant anti-corruption laws, we may be subject to fines and legal sanctions, including among others the termination of existing contracts and disqualification from contracting with public contracting entities. However, the application of disqualifying measures from public tenders and other sanctions will depend, amongst other things, on whether or not we had in place at the time of the alleged criminal activities appropriate anti-corruption procedures, the extent to which our senior management was involved in the illegal activities and whether we have, in the meantime, put in place remediation or self-cleaning measures which are deemed sufficiently strong and effective by the competent courts and/ or contracting entities to ensure our reliability and morality as a supplier of public contracting entities. In addition, the preliminary analysis we have performed to date confirms that our organizational model pursuant to LD 231/2001 was properly implemented. Based on the results of our internal audit activities and the current findings of the preliminary internal investigation conducted by our external counsel, Ropes & Gray and Gianni Origoni, Grippo, Cappelli &Partners, who also engaged external forensic auditors (Alix Partners), as well as the investigation carried out by our supervisory board (Organismo di Vigilanza), all of which are still in progress, we remain confident that our compliance and monitoring systems are robust, as we take our obligations under LD 231/2001 very seriously. In addition, the current findings of the preliminary internal investigation undertaken by our external legal counsel suggest that our senior management was unaware of the alleged activities, that the events did not go beyond the alleged actions relating to ATM and that no other employees beyond the seven under investigation were directly involved in the alleged actions. Moreover, based on such current findings, the investigation has not identified similar misconduct involving other current and potential customers of the Group. We expect to use the findings of the internal investigation undertaken by external legal counsel to prepare our defense in the ongoing criminal investigation and proceedings. However, a negative outcome of the investigation may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations, in particular in respect of the Group’s business from public administration customers. For further information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may _incur liabilities for the actions of our directors, employees, agents, representatives, advisors and intermediaries, including under LD 231/2001,” “—We face risks related to the services we provide to government and other public entities,” “—We are subject to the risk of litigation, tax and regulatory investigations, quality audits by our customers and other claims,” “—If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud,” “—We are subject to anti-corruption and anti- bribery laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate,” “—We may be unable to obtain the bid bonds, performance bonds, securities or guarantees we need to compete in certain public tenders or to enter into certain contracts with our private customers, and due to our failure to perform our obligations, counterparties may enforce performance bonds we have posted” and “—A significant proportion of our revenues comes from contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes, which require substantial time and resource investments and may be challenged by losing bidders.”_ Under Italian law, companies subject to investigation for the aforementioned crimes can put in place remediation or self-cleansing actions, which can potentially mitigate the risk of the application of disqualifying measures from public tenders and other sanctions. The Company will assess the implementation of relevant remediation or self-cleansing measures upon the results of its internal investigation. 16 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725
1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.18,Recent Developments,9.18.2,Recent Trading,"_As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have completed trading for the eight months ended August 31, 2020. As we did not formally close our books and records for August 2019, the discussion below presents our estimated results and net financial position as of and for the eight months ended August 31, 2020 and the two months ended August 31, 2020, without comparing such estimated results and net financial position with any date or period in 2019. Investors are advised not to place any undue reliance on this discussion._ Based on preliminary results, derived from our unaudited management accounts and other information currently available, we estimate that for the eight months ended August 31, 2020, our revenues were €755.5 million. We estimate that during the eight months ended August 31, 2020, demand for our products and services was strong across all of our activity types and all of our industry verticals, particularly in our Finance, Health and Public Administration verticals, with the exception of (i) our Industry & Services industry vertical, which experienced relatively weaker demand within the automotive, travel and leisure sub-segments as a result of an industry-wide slowdown in business activity, primarily in the cruise line business, mainly as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) the Telco & Media industry vertical, which continued to experience a significant reduction in volumes generated by our Mobile VAS platform, which enables mobile operators to sell value-added products and services to customers with subscriptions, resulting from restrictions imposed by the competent Italian authorities on the use of services through our Mobile VAS platform by such mobile operators. In addition, revenues for the eight months ended August 31, 2020 were driven by the full consolidation of the results of Deus Technology S.r.l. and FDL Servizi S.r.l., which we acquired in the second half of 2019 and in February 2020, respectively. Furthermore, we estimate that revenues for the eight months ended August 31, 2020 were impacted by the overall slowdown in business activity in Italy over the summer months, when we typically record lower cash collection and revenue generation levels across all our activity types and industry verticals primarily due to the extended school holidays during the month of August. Furthermore, we estimate that for the eight months ended August 31, 2020, our Adjusted EBITDA was €93.2 million. Key drivers of our Adjusted EBITDA for the eight months ended August 31, 2020 included profitable growth across all of our industry verticals as a result of increased demand for our services following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the exception of Public Administration, which was impacted by the slowdown in tax collection, and Telco & Media, which was impacted by the loss of volume from our Mobile _VAS platform resulting from restrictions imposed by the Italian authorities on the use of services through our Mobile VAS platform by mobile operators. In addition, we estimate that our Adjusted EBITDA for the eight_ months ended August 31, 2020 was impacted by the overall slowdown in business activity in Italy over the summer months, when we typically record lower cash collection and revenue generation levels across all our activity types and industry verticals primarily due to the extended school holidays during the month of August. We also estimate that our Adjusted EBITDA for the eight months ended August 31, 2020 benefitted from costsaving initiatives we started to implement during 2019, such as an initiative to streamline and optimize our workforce by filling vacant positions with young, highly-skilled personnel and reducing the overall number of our employees, as well as cost-reduction measures that we implemented in response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, including a reduction in travel expenses, the temporary placement of a limited number of projects and employees on temporary government subsidy programs (such as our internal travel agency), the renegotiation of services and utilities contracts relating to our facilities and offices and other cost-saving efficiencies resulting from our company-wide transition to smart working. We intend to permanently integrate several of these cost-saving measures into our business structure going forward. Additionally, based on preliminary results derived from our unaudited management accounts and other information currently available, we estimate that for the two months ended August 31, 2020, our revenues were €164.0 million and that our Adjusted EBITDA was €21.0 million. We estimate that the key drivers for our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA in the two months ended August 31, 2020 included growth across most of our activity types and industry verticals, including within the automotive, travel and leisure sub-segments of our Industry & Services industry vertical after a period of weaker demand as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the exception of Public Administration, which continued to be impacted by the slowdown in tax collection, and Telco & Media, which continued to be impacted by the loss of volume from our Mobile VAS platform resulting from restrictions imposed by the Italian authorities on the use of services through our Mobile _VAS platform by mobile operators. We estimate that these drivers were offset by lower levels of cash collection_ 17 ----- and revenue generation across all our activity types and industry verticals, primarily as a result of the nationwide slowdown in business activity in Italy over the summer months, mainly due to the extended school holidays during the month of August. For the eight months ended August 31, 2020, our business is proving to remain resilient on the back of continued demand from customers, with sales bookings being in line with sales bookings for the eight months ended August 31, 2019. In addition, we estimate that the net financial indebtedness of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of August 31, 2020 was €98.4 million, an increase of €9.8 million from €88.6 million as of June 30, 2020. These amounts include (i) the net impact on our cash position as of August 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, from the sales of trade receivables we made prior to August 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively, and (ii) the amounts of cash for R&D grants collected on behalf of our partners during the eight months ended August 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. This amount does not include indebtedness incurred by the Issuer and outstanding as of August 31, 2020, including the amounts drawn under the Bridge Facilities on the Acquisition Closing Date. For a summary of the net debt position of the Issuer as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, please see “Summary Historical and Certain Other Financial _Data—Other Financial Information and As Adjusted Data” and “Capitalization.” This preliminary information is based on internal management accounts and has been prepared under the responsibility of our management.

1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.18,Recent Developments,9.18.3,COVID-19 Update,"In March 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we promptly undertook a number of initiatives to safeguard our employees and reduce our operating costs while ensuring the continuity of our operations. In particular, we successfully transitioned substantially all of our approximately 11,600 employees to remote working over a short period of time while at the same time maintaining the full operation of all our data centers, which are equipped with continuity and backup systems, full-service delivery of our services and complete business continuity services. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, an average of 6,800 employees per day continue to work remotely. Additionally, to manage our cost structure and reduce our cash burn, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our travel costs and placed a limited number of our projects as well as employees within certain specific functions (such as our internal travel agency and the employees of our tax collection business, Municipia S.p.A.) on temporary government subsidy programs which are currently still in place. The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our supply chain is limited as our suppliers and partners are able to work remotely and our reliance on physical product deliveries is limited. Since the start of the outbreak of the pandemic we have experienced an increase in customer demand for digitalization products and services, as businesses and public administration entities have been forced to rely on IT infrastructures and systems and have turned to remote working and cloud-based solutions to run their operations. Leveraging our significant experience in digital transformation projects, our state-of-the-art software and digital solutions portfolio as well as our existing workforce and contractors, which we utilize as needed to meet our fluctuating labor requirements, we assisted new and existing clients in their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including in connection with digital transformation projects, digital workplace solutions, cybersecurity, cloud-based solutions and business continuity solutions. For example, we assisted one of our clients, INPS (Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale), in managing the transition of a large portion of its workforce to remote working over a short timeframe by providing virtual private network, remote desktop and virtual desktop infrastructure and in managing the large increase in requests for state aid and benefits following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we played a key role in assisting healthcare authorities in the Veneto region with implementing effective measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic by developing Eng-DE4Bios, our data-driven and cloud-native bio-surveillance system that collects, integrates and harmonizes data and utilizes digital enabling technologies to geo-locate infected individuals and identify 18 ----- population clusters that may be at risk. Furthermore, through one of our subsidiaries, Cybertech Group, we provide hospitals and other strategically important institutions with cybersecurity services to protect their IT infrastructure from cyberattacks. Given this increased demand for digitalization products and services, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will contribute to an acceleration in the digitalization of Italian companies and public administrations, further contributing to the long-term growth trend in the IT services market. Lastly, during the lockdowns imposed by government authorities in response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to train our employees through approximately 140 online classes offered by our IT & Management Academy and continued to progress more than 80 active research projects through our European and global network of partners.

Loan[(7)]** (the “Company”)[(9)] (Italy) Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries[(10)] (1) Bain Capital and Neuberger Berman each indirectly holds 50% of the share capital of Centurion Midco S.à r.l., an indirect parent of the Issuer. Pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement, the Sponsors expect to allocate a portion of the share capital of Centurion Midco S.à r.l. for equity re-investment by certain members of the Company’s senior management team through a management incentive plan to be implemented following the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Principal Shareholders—Shareholder Agreement” and “Certain 20 ----- _Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Management Co-Investment Plan.” Centurion Midco S.à r.l. indirectly controls the_ Issuer through the intermediate holding companies Centurion Holdco S.à r.l. and TopCo. Following the consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer became the direct owner of the entire issued and outstanding share capital of the Company. See “Principal _Shareholders.”_ (2) In connection with the Transactions, on July 22, 2020, TopCo issued €216.5 million aggregate principal amount of PIK Notes in a private placement, the net proceeds of which were on-lent by TopCo to the Issuer in the form of a deeply subordinated shareholder loan as part of the Shareholder Funding to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition. See “Summary—The Transactions—The _Financing of the Acquisition and the Refinancing.” The PIK Notes will mature in 2028. The PIK Notes are not guaranteed by, and do not_ receive any other credit support from, the Issuer, the Company or their respective subsidiaries. Interest payable under the PIK Notes may be paid either through the issuance of additional PIK Notes or in cash, at the sole discretion of TopCo. For a description of the key terms of the PIK Notes, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—PIK Notes.” (3) The Revolving Credit Facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to €160.0 million (equivalent). See “Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” The initial borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility is the Issuer._ Subject to certain limitations, other subsidiaries of the Issuer, including the Company, may become borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility in the future. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to applicable laws, the holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral (x) only after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full and (y) on a pari passu basis with the lender under the New Term Loan. We currently expect that the Revolving Credit Facility will be undrawn on the Issue Date. (4) The New Term Loan will provide for term loans in an aggregate principal amount of €38.4 million. The Issuer’s obligations under the New Term Loan rank pari passu with the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Indenture and will be guaranteed and secured on the same basis as the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Term Loan Agreement.” (5) In connection with the Acquisition, the Issuer used the amounts drawn under the Bridge Facilities, together with the Shareholder Funding, to (i) pay the purchase price for the Acquisition, (ii) together with cash on the Company’s balance sheet, refinance the Refinanced Company Indebtedness, (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Acquisition, the Financing, the Refinancing and the entry into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and (iv) fund cash to the Company’s balance sheet for general corporate purposes. See “Summary—The Transactions—The Financing of the Acquisition and the Refinancing.” The Issuer is offering €605.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The gross proceeds from the Offering will be used, together with the proceeds from the New Term Loan and cash on the Issuer’s balance sheet, to repay in full and cancel the indebtedness incurred under the Bridge Facilities, including accrued interest thereon, and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the Offering and the incurrence of the New Term Loan. See “Summary—The Transactions—The Financing of the Acquisition and the Refinancing” and “Use of Proceeds.” (6) The Notes will be general, senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan. On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Issue Date Collateral. Within ten Business Days from (and excluding) the Merger Date, subject the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, the Notes will be secured by the Post-Merger Collateral. In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Issue Date, within 20 Business Days following the issuance by the Company of its Guarantee, the Notes will also be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, by the Company Collateral. The Collateral will also secure the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations (if any) and the New Term Loan on a pari passu basis. In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Acquisition Closing Date, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is expected to be secured by the Company Collateral within thirty Business Days from the date falling twelve months after the Acquisition Closing Date, whereas the Company Collateral will only be required to be granted in relation to the Notes and the New Term Loan within twenty Business Days following the issuance by the Company of its Guarantee. Furthermore, the Company will grant the Company Collateral for the benefit of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility prior to granting its Guarantee of the Notes and the New Term Loan. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and subject to applicable laws, in the event of an enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral (x) only after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full and (y) on a pari passu basis with the lender under the New Term Loan. Any remaining proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied pro rata to the repayment of all obligations under the Indenture and any other senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors (if any) permitted to be incurred and secured by such Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (if any). The security interests in the Collateral will be limited by applicable law and subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability and may be released under certain circumstances. For further information, see “Description of the Notes—Security,” “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and _Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security Interests.” Subject to and as set forth in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the_ Issuer will not be liable to pay any Additional Amounts to holders of the Notes in relation to any withholding or deduction required pursuant to Decree No. 239, if the Notes are held by a person resident in a country that is not included in the list issued under Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239, and otherwise in the circumstances as described in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” (7) On the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer utilized a portion of the proceeds of the Bridge Facilities to make the Funding Loan to the Company for an aggregate amount of €114.4 million. The Company applied a portion of the proceeds from the Funding Loan to refinance the Refinanced Company Indebtedness and pay related fees and expenses, whereas the remaining proceeds were funded to the Company’s balance sheet for general corporate purposes. See “Summary—The Transactions—The Financing of the Acquisition and the Refinancing,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security Interests—The principal amount of the Funding Loan forming part of the Collateral may be less than anticipated as a result of prepayments of certain indebtedness of the Group prior to the maturity date of the Notes” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Funding Loan.” 21 ----- (8) The Issuer is a holding company incorporated under the laws of Italy as a joint stock company (società per azioni). The Issuer is currently not expected to engage in any activities other than those related to the Transactions, the management of the Group following the Acquisition and any other future potential transactions permitted by the Indenture. We intend to use commercially reasonable efforts to merge the Issuer with the Company, with MergerCo being the surviving entity, as soon as reasonably practicable during the twelve months following the Issue Date. See “Description of the Notes—Post-Completion Merger.” The Post-Completion Merger is subject to certain conditions and may not be completed. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security Interests— _We may be unable to complete the Post-Completion Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.”_ (9) Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and will not be guaranteed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Issue Date, the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company to implement the Whitewash Procedure and guarantee the Notes on a senior secured basis as soon as reasonably practicable following the approval of the annual financial statements of the Company for the financial year ending December 31, 2020 and in any event prior to the date falling eighteen months following the Issue Date, provided that this undertaking shall no longer apply following the consummation of the Post-Completion Merger. The Whitewash Procedure is subject to certain conditions and significant limitations under applicable Italian law and there is no assurance that it will be completed. See also “Risk Factors—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—Once granted, the Guarantee and _the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.” The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to guarantee the_ New Term Loan on the same date as, and on a pari passu basis with, the Notes. The Company will also guarantee our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility on or prior to the date on which the Company provides its Guarantee under the Indenture, to the extent applicable. In particular, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Acquisition Closing Date, the Company is expected to provide a Guarantee in respect of its obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement within thirty Business Days from the first anniversary of the Acquisition Closing Date, whereas Company will not be required to provide its Guarantee until the date falling eighteen months following the Issue Date. Prior to the Post-Completion Merger and, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Issue Date, prior to the granting of the Guarantee by the Company, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including the Company). In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur and after the granting of the Guarantee by the Company (and subject to any limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Company. After the Post-Completion Merger, none of MergerCo’s subsidiaries is expected to guarantee the Notes, and the Notes will therefore be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of MergerCo. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the Company accounted for 72% of the revenue and 64% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the Group, in each case, before intercompany eliminations. As of June 30, 2020, the Company accounted for 91% of the total assets of the Group, before intercompany eliminations. As of June 30, 2020, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions and following the completion of the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo would have had €0.5 million of unsecured third party indebtedness (other than the Notes). Italian law limits the amount of obligations that may be guaranteed, or in respect of which security interests may be provided as well as the enforceability of the Guarantee and the rights to the security securing the Notes and the Guarantee. By virtue of such limitations, the Company’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or the Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. The Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.” (10) None of the subsidiaries of the Company is expected to guarantee the Notes. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the subsidiaries of the Company collectively accounted for 28% of the revenue and 36% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the Group, before intercompany eliminations. As of June 30, 2020, the subsidiaries of the Company accounted for 9% of the total assets of the Group, in each case, before intercompany eliminations. As of June 30, 2020, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, the subsidiaries of the Company would have had €7.4 million of third-party debt outstanding, all of which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security Interests—Prior to the Merger Date and, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Issue Date, prior to the granting of the Guarantee by the Company (which is subject to the completion of the Whitewash Procedure), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the existing or future indebtedness or obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, including the Company. After the granting of the Guarantee by the Company (and subject to any limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer, other than the Company. After the Post-Completion Merger, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of MergerCo.” Certain subsidiaries of the Company are not wholly owned (directly or indirectly) by the Company. In certain cases, the minority shareholders of such subsidiaries have contractual arrangements with us pursuant to which they may, following the exercise of put options under such contractual arrangements and subject to certain conditions and timing requirements, require us to purchase their minority stake. As of June 30, 2020, the aggregate amount of our liabilities in connection with such put options amounted to €37.7 million. For further information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Certain of our subsidiaries have non-controlling shareholders whose interests may differ from ours.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Issue Date, the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company to implement the Whitewash Procedure and guarantee the Notes on a senior secured, joint and several basis as soon as reasonably practicable following the approval of the annual financial statements of the Company for the financial year ending December 31, 2020 and in any event prior to the date falling eighteen months following the Issue Date, provided that this undertaking shall no longer apply following the consummation of the Post-Completion Merger. The Whitewash Procedure is subject to certain conditions and significant limitations under applicable Italian law and there is no assurance that it will be completed. See also “Risk Factors—Risk _Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral— Once granted, the Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability”_ and “Certain _Insolvency_ _Law Considerations_ _and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ The Company will also guarantee our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility on or prior to the date on which the Company provides its Guarantee under the Indenture, to the extent applicable. In particular, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Acquisition Closing Date, the Company is expected to provide a guarantee in respect of its obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement within thirty Business Days from the first anniversary of the Acquisition Closing Date, whereas the Company will not be required to provide its Guarantee until the date falling eighteen months following the Issue Date. Prior to the Post-Completion Merger and, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Issue Date, prior to the granting of the Guarantee by the Company, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including the Company). In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur and after the granting of the Guarantee by the Company (and subject to any limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Company. After the Post-Completion Merger, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of MergerCo. 24 ----- For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the Company accounted for 72% of the revenue and 64% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the Group, in each case, before intercompany eliminations. As of December 31, 2019, the Company accounted for 91% of the total assets of the Group before intercompany eliminations. As of June 30, 2020, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions and following the completion of the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo would have had €0.5 million of unsecured third party indebtedness (other than the Notes). The Guarantee will be subject to certain contractual and legal limitations, as described under “Description of the Notes—The Notes Guarantee” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.” By virtue of these limitations, the Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or the Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security Interests— Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantee and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral,” “Risk Factors—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral— Once granted, the Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests,” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” In addition, the Guarantee may be released under certain circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—The Notes Guarantee—Notes Guarantee _Release.”_ None of the subsidiaries of the Company is expected to guarantee the Notes. As of June 30, 2020, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, the subsidiaries of the Company would have had €7.4 million of thirdparty debt outstanding, all of which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes. Ranking of the Guarantee . . . . . .** The Guarantee will upon its issuance: - be a senior obligation of the Guarantor; - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee, including the Guarantor’s guarantee of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations related thereto (if any) and the New Term Loan; - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Guarantor that is expressly subordinated to its Guarantee; - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure its Guarantee, or which secures such other indebtedness on a super senior basis (including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations related thereto (if any)), to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such other indebtedness or obligation; and 25 ----- - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of subsidiaries of the Guarantor, in each case that are not Guarantors, including obligations owed to trade creditors of such subsidiary. Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On or about the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, the Notes will be secured by the Issue Date Collateral. Within ten Business Days from (and excluding) the Merger Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, the Notes will be secured by the Post-Merger Collateral. In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Issue Date, within 20 Business Days following the issuance by the Company of its Guarantee, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, by the Company Collateral, consisting of (i) pledges over the structural intercompany receivables owed to the Company by certain direct wholly owned material subsidiaries of the Company (if any); and (ii) pledges over the shares in certain direct wholly owned material subsidiaries of the Company (if any). Each of the Issue Date Collateral, the Post-Merger Collateral and the Company Collateral is further described under “Description of the Notes—Security.” The Collateral will also secure the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations (if any) and the New Term Loan. In the event of an enforcement in respect of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security Interests— Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture, the New Term Loan Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement on a “super senior” basis are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority over the Notes and the New Term Loan,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral— Once granted, the Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ The security interests may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability. In addition, the security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. Subject to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral may be pledged to secure future indebtedness. For more information on the security interests granted, see “Description of the Notes—Security” and for more information on potential limitations to the security interests, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related _to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ 26 ----- Post-Completion Merger . . . . . . .** We intend to use commercially reasonable efforts to merge the Issuer with the Company in accordance with Articles 2501-bis and following of the Italian Civil Code and other applicable provisions of Italian law, with MergerCo being the surviving entity, as soon as reasonably practicable during the twelve months following the Issue Date. See “Description of _the Notes—Certain Covenants—The Post-Completion Merger.” The_ Post-Completion Merger is subject to certain conditions and may not be completed. See “Risk _Factors—Risks_ _Related_ _to_ _the_ _Notes,_ _the _Guarantee and the Security Interests—We may be unable to complete the Post-Completion Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.”_ Use of Proceeds** . . . . . . . . . . . . . The gross proceeds from the Offering will be used, together with the proceeds from the New Term Loan and cash on the Issuer’s balance sheet, to repay in full and cancel the indebtedness incurred under the Bridge Facilities, including accrued interest thereon, and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the Offering and the incurrence of the New Term Loan. See “Summary—The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.” Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . .** Prior to September 30, 2022, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, plus a “make whole” premium, as described under “Description of the _Notes—Optional Redemption.”_ Prior to September 30, 2022, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Notes issued) in each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, prior to, 2022, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption prices set forth in “Description of the _Notes—Optional Redemption.”_ The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time on or after, 2022, at the relevant redemption prices described under “Description of _the Notes—Optional Redemption.”_ Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . .** All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantee will be made without withholding or deduction for taxes or other governmental charges, except to the extent required by law. If withholding or deduction is required by law in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”), the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will pay additional amounts so that the net amount you receive is no less than that which you would have received in the absence of such withholding or deduction, subject to certain exceptions (the “Additional Amounts”). See “Description _of_ _the_ _Notes— _Withholding Taxes.”_ Tax Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction become effective that would impose withholding taxes or other deductions on the payments on the Notes, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See “Description of the Notes— _Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”_ 27 ----- Change of Control** . . . . . . . . . . . Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the purchase. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” Tender Offers** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw the Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders of Notes, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes in such offer. See “Description of the Notes— Optional Redemption—General.” Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture limits the ability of the Issuer and, in certain cases, TopCo to: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock; - make certain restricted payments; - make certain investments; - create or permit to exist certain liens; - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us; - merge or consolidate with other entities, or make certain asset sales; - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; - carry out certain activities prior to the consummation of the PostCompletion Merger; and - guarantee certain indebtedness. Certain of the covenants and events of default will be suspended if and for so long as we achieve investment-grade ratings. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants and Release of Notes Security Interests on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” Each of the covenants in the Indenture are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain _Covenants.”_ Original Issue Discount . . . . . . . .** If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount greater than or equal to a statutorily defined de minimis amount, then the Notes will be considered to be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. Holder (as defined in “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain U.S. _Federal Income Tax Considerations”) generally will be required to_ include such OID in gross income as ordinary income as it accrues on a constant yield basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, generally in advance of the receipt of the cash payments to which such OID is attributable and regardless of such U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Certain Taxation _Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_ 28 ----- Transfer Restrictions** . . . . . . . . . Neither the Notes nor the Guarantee have been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction nor will they be so registered. The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. See “Notice to Investors.” Holders of the Notes will not have the benefit of any exchange or registration rights. Exchange . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Listing** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . There is currently no market for the Notes. Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and to admit the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. Governing Law** . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes, the Indenture and the Guarantee will be governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are governed by the laws of England and Wales. The New Term Loan will be governed by the laws of England and Wales. Each security document will be governed by the applicable law of the jurisdiction under which the relevant security interest is granted.

See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”  Unaudited.  Our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the year ended December 31, 2019, the six month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 presented in this table reflect the application of IFRS 16, whereas the comparative figures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 reflect our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, respectively, prior to the implementation of IFRS 16. Accordingly, such figures are not directly comparable and investors should exercise caution when comparing our Adjusted EBITDA or our Adjusted EBITDA Margin across these periods. See “Presentation of Financial _and Other Information.”_ (1) We define organic revenue growth as the percentage growth in Group revenue between two periods (the later of such periods, the “subsequent period”), excluding from the subsequent period the contribution to the Group’s revenue by entities that were acquired by the Group during such period. Organic revenue growth is not a measure presented in accordance with IFRS. When assessing our operating performance, you should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our revenue growth that is calculated in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures.” (2) We define Adjusted EBITDA as net profit from continuing operations before income taxes, financial income, income from investments, financial expenses (excluding interests on lease liabilities), interest on lease liabilities (only following the implementation of IFRS 16 as of and from January 1, 2019 and not for periods prior to such date), depreciation of property, plant and equipment, depreciation of right of use assets, amortization of intangible assets, provision and impairments of assets, and further adjusted for the effects of certain events and transactions that management considers to be unrelated to our underlying trading performance, including stock option costs, retirement incentives, costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters, non-income tax assessment costs and corporate strategic assessment expenses. Management believes that adjustments relating to certain expenses and income were necessary in order to ensure a better comparability of the historical data relating to the financial years in question as these include items not considered by management to be attributable to the normal operational management of our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful metric for investors to understand our results of operations and profitability because it permits investors to evaluate our recurring profitability from underlying operating activities. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with a tool to compare the historical performance of our business across different periods as our adjustments to net profit from continuing operations and the exclusion of certain costs and expenses include items not considered by management to be attributable to the day-to-day operation of our business. We also use this measure internally to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor our business, as well as evaluating our underlying historical performance. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the presentation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-IFRS Measure and the term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Consequently, the use of Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income, operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with IFRS. When assessing our operating performance, you should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income, operating income or any other operating performance or liquidity measure that is calculated in accordance with IFRS. For a more detailed description of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA as analytical tool, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures.” 33 ----- The following table reconciles our net profit from continuing operations, our most directly comparable measure under IFRS, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, minus any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any re-measurement of the lease liabilities. The cost of rights-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, lease payments made at or before the commencement date and restoration costs. Lease liability is recognized at the commencement date and is measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using incremental borrowing rates, if the specific interest rate implicit in the lease agreement is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities increases to reflect the accretion of interest and decreases for the lease payments made. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities under an on-balance sheet model that is similar to finance lease accounting under IAS 17. We adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized as an adjustment to the Group’s opening equity balance on January 1, 2019, which was nil. The periods prior to January 1, 2019 have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect prior to that date. (b) The increase in impairment of assets in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily relates to a provision for doubtful receivables by, and a write-down of receivables due from, the Group’s wholly owned subsidiary SISEV in the amount of €26.8 million. See also “Business—Legal Proceedings.” (c) Stock option costs represent costs of our share incentive plan apportioned over the vesting period and are determined with reference to the grant date fair value of the right assigned to our employees. Stock option costs are recognized as personnel costs in our income statement. The Group excludes stock option costs from Adjusted EBITDA in order to (i) enhance comparability with similar businesses, as the amount of share-based compensation awarded differs from company to company, and (ii) enhance comparability of the trading performance of our businesses year-on-year. (d) Retirement incentives include costs related to the early termination of employment relationships as a result of redundancy incentives, including solidarity plans and agreed plans, incurred in connection with the right-sizing of our workforce during the year ended December 31, 2019. (e) Represents expenses incurred in connection with the relocation of our headquarters that took place during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Group excludes these expenses from Adjusted EBITDA as they relate to specific actions taken by management to improve the future profitability of the Group and are not expected to recur in the following financial years. (f) Represents one-off charges for the strategic assessment of the Group as well as due diligence activities carried out by external professional service providers in connection with the Acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2019. See “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2018 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019—Service costs.”_ (g) Represents non-income tax charges for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of fines incurred in connection with a reassessment of past income taxes (€2.7 million) as well as unrecoverable withholding taxes paid in certain countries of operation outside of Italy (€0.2 million). (h) Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 is presented without giving effect to the application of IFRS 16 while Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019, the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 is presented after giving effect to the application of IFRS 16. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA 34 ----- for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 is not directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019, the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. See “Presentation of _Financial and Other Information—Changes in Accounting Standards and Accounting Policies.” Prior to giving effect to the_ application of IFRS 16, Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been €159.7 million, Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively, would have been €59.4 million and €62.3 million and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 would have been €162.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA prior to the application of IFRS 16 for the year ended December 31, 2019, each of the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 is presented herein for information purposes only and does not purport to present what our Adjusted EBITDA for those periods would have been had IFRS 16 not been in effect since January 1, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income, operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with IFRS. When assessing our operating performance, you should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income, operating income or any other operating performance or liquidity measure that is calculated in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other _Information—Non-IFRS Measures.”_ (3) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues, expressed as a percentage. Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 is presented without giving effect to the application of IFRS 16 while Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the year ended December 31, 2019, the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, is presented after giving effect to the application of IFRS 16. Prior to giving effect to the application of IFRS 16, Adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019, 10.0% and 10.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and 13.0% and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. Adjusted EBITDA margin prior to the application of IFRS 16 for the year ended December 31, 2019, each of the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 is presented herein for information purposes only and does not purport to present what our Adjusted EBITDA margin for those periods would have been had IFRS 16 not been in effect since January 1, 2019. (4) We define capital expenditure as purchase of property, plant and equipment plus purchase of intangible assets. Capital expenditure excludes the consideration paid by us for the acquisition of other businesses. Capital expenditure is not a measure recognized by IFRS.

See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures.” (6) We define net working capital as current customer contract assets, inventories, deferred contract costs, trade receivables and other current assets less current trade payables, other current liabilities, current tax payables and current provisions for risks and charges. We define adjusted net working capital as net working capital, as adjusted for certain effects that management does not consider representative of the ongoing operations of the Group. 35 ----- The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net working capital and adjusted net working capital to current assets and current liabilities, our most directly comparable measures under IFRS, as at the dates indicated:",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

We are adjusting our cash and cash equivalents for the aforementioned sales of trade receivables in light of the fact that, although historically from time to time to support our working capital and other liquidity needs, we engaged in the sale of trade receivables from certain large customers, which is reflected in the amount of our cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2020 as well as in the amount of cash and cash equivalents as of prior balance sheet dates set forth in our Financial Statements, following the completion of the Transactions, we intend to primarily rely on our operating cash flow as well as our Revolving Credit Facility to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity needs. See “Summary—The Transactions—The _Financing of the Acquisition and the Refinancing” and “Use of Proceeds.” In addition, as adjusted cash and cash equivalents has been_ adjusted to give effect to the full repayment and cancellation of the indebtedness incurred under the Bridge Facilities (€644.5 million) with the gross proceeds from this Offering (€597.5 million) and from the New Term Loan (€38.4 million) and cash on balance sheet (€12.7 million), including €4.5 million of accrued and unpaid interest through the Issue Date of October 8, 2020, plus €4.1 million of estimated expenses in connection with the Offering and the incurrence of the New Term Loan, in each case, as if they had occurred on June 30, 2020. Following the completion of the Transactions, we intend to primarily rely on our operating cash flow as well as our Revolving Credit Facility to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity needs. As a result, our cash and cash equivalents as of the Issue Date, or as of any future date, may vary from the amount of cash and cash equivalents shown in the table above. In addition, from time to time, we also collect cash for R&D grants on behalf of our partners which is reflected in the amount of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2020, as set forth in the “actual” column above as well as in the amount of cash and cash equivalents as of prior balance sheet dates set forth in our Financial Statements.

See “Capitalization.” (10) As adjusted net debt (excluding leases) represents our consolidated total indebtedness, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions less as adjusted cash and cash equivalents. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Rolled Company Indebtedness.” As adjusted net debt (excluding leases) is presented excluding, in each case as of June 30, 2020, (x) certain other financial liabilities of the Group that do not constitute indebtedness in the amount of €23.3 million, primarily relating to payables to our partners in respect of research and development grants that we have collected on their behalf (€5.7 million) as well as earn-outs payable in connection with previous acquisitions (€17.6 million), (y) lease liabilities under IFRS 16 in the amount of €169.8 million and (z) non-current liabilities pursuant to the contractual arrangements with the non-controlling shareholders of certain of our subsidiaries, which may require us to purchase shares at predetermined prices under certain put and call options, and which amounted to €37.7 million. See also “Capitalization.” (11) As adjusted net debt (including leases) represents our consolidated total indebtedness, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, plus €169.8 million of lease obligations recognized under IFRS 16 as of June 30, 2020 less as adjusted cash and cash equivalents. See “Capitalization.” (12) As adjusted cash interest expense (including leases) reflects the as adjusted interest expense of the Group for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, as if the Notes had been issued, and the New Term Loan had been entered into, on July 1, 2019 and the proceeds therefrom had been used as set forth under “Use of Proceeds.” This estimate reflects (i) the issuance of €605.0 million 5.875% Notes issued at 98.766% and (ii) the drawing of term loans under the New Term Loan Agreement in an aggregate amount of €38.4 million at an interest rate per annum of three-month EURIBOR plus 5.00% (assuming the three-month EURIBOR rate as of the date hereof was in effect for the entire period). As adjusted cash interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 also includes interest on lease liabilities in the amount of €0.8 million as well as the estimated cash interest expense payable in respect of the Rolled Company Indebtedness that remained outstanding following the Acquisition Closing Date. As adjusted cash interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 excludes interest and commitment fees payable in respect of our Revolving Credit Facility, which we expect to be undrawn on the Issue Date. As adjusted cash interest expense is being presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our interest expense would have actually been had the issue of the Notes occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport to project our interest expenses for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

Our historical summary consolidated financial information set forth below as of and for the year ended (i) December 31, 2017, has been derived from the unaudited comparative column in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, (ii) December 31, 2018, has been derived from our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and (iii) December 31, 2019, has been derived from the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, except for the consolidated statement of financial position information which has been derived from the comparative column in our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are, in each case, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The historical consolidated financial information and other data as of June 30, 2020 and for the six month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 have been derived from our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six month period ended June 30, 2020, which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, unless otherwise stated. Some of the performance indicators and ratios shown below were taken from our accounting records and are not included in the Financial Statements. The unaudited historical financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 is calculated by adding the financial information for the year ended December 31, 2019 to the financial information for the six month period ended June 30, 2020, and subtracting the financial information for the six month period ended June 30, 2019. The results of operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 have been prepared solely for the purposes of this Offering Memorandum and are for illustrative purposes only. On January 1, 2019, we adopted IFRS 16. IFRS 16 was applied using the modified retrospective approach and the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard was recognized at the date of initial application, being January 1, 2019. The transition to IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019, gave rise to changes to our assets and liabilities. As of January 1, 2019, our right-of-use assets amounted to €162.0 million and lease liabilities amounted to €162.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, our right-of-use assets amounted to €173.4 million and lease liabilities amounted to €174.8 million. The depreciation of right-of-use assets for the year ended December 31, 2019, amounted to €20.0 million and the interest expense on lease liabilities amounted to €1.5 million. As of June 30, 2020, our right-of-use assets amounted to €167.2 million and our lease liabilities amounted to €169.8 million. The depreciation of right-of-use assets for the six months ended June 30, 2020, amounted to €9.9 million and the interest expense on lease liabilities amounted to €0.8 million. For more information, refer to our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. On January 1, 2018, we adopted IFRS 15 and IFRS 9. IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 were applied using the modified retrospective approach and therefore the retained earnings as of January 1, 2018 was adjusted to reflect this change for application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15. For more information, refer to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 have not been restated for the application of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 have not been restated for the application of IFRS 16. Instead, those financial statements applied the relevant predecessor accounting standards. Therefore, due to the adoption of the new accounting standards and the accounting policies changes applied, the consolidated financial statement as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are not directly comparable with the consolidated financial information as of December 31, 2017. We have also presented summary unaudited as adjusted consolidated financial and other data prepared to give effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on July 1, 2019, in the case of summary unaudited as adjusted consolidated income statement information, and June 30, 2020, in the case of summary unaudited as adjusted consolidated balance sheet information. The summary unaudited as adjusted consolidated financial and other data is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what our actual interest expense actually would have been if the Transactions had occurred on July 1, 2019, or what our actual net debt position would have been had the Transactions occurred on June 30, 2020, or on any other date, and such data does not purport to project our financial results for any future period. The summary consolidated financial information below includes certain non-IFRS measures that we use to evaluate our economic and financial performance. These measures are not identified as accounting measures_ 30 ----- _under IFRS and therefore should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS or those calculated using financial measures that are prepared in accordance with IFRS.

1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.1,The markets in which we operate are highly competitive.,"We operate in the Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets, which represent our core business and accounted for the vast majority of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. We also provide IT services, software and digital solutions in 50 countries, including major European countries, such as Belgium and Germany, Turkey, the United States and Latin American countries, such as Brazil. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid change. We believe that the principal competitive factors in these markets are service quality, technical and industry expertise, price, innovation, established relationships with key customers, often on a local level, knowledge of the regulatory framework, rapidity in providing services requested by the customers and the ability to add value to a customer’s business. We compete for business with a variety of players, including large multinational firms and local players that provide consulting, technology and/ or business process services, in-house captives of potential customers, software services companies that also provide business process services and accounting firms that also provide IT consulting services. In addition, the trend toward international expansion by IT services providers and continued technological changes may result in new and different competitors entering our markets. These competitors may include entrants from other industries, such as the communications, software and data networking industries or entrants from geographical locations with lower labor and production costs than in Italy. Our main competitors include Italian and European players, such as Reply, Almaviva and Capgemini and large American and global multinational companies such as IBM, Accenture and NTT Data. Some of our competitors may benefit from greater economies of scale, have greater financial, marketing, technological or other resources, larger customer bases and better-established reputations and customer relationships in our markets than we do. As a result, some of these competitors may be able to: - more efficiently or more rapidly develop superior services or solutions, gain greater market acceptance and expand their service offerings; - more quickly adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements; - bundle services with other services they provide at reduced prices; - adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the promotion, marketing and sales of their products or services, which could cause us to have to lower prices for certain products or services to remain competitive in the market; - devote greater resources to the research and development of their services and solutions; and - better withstand adverse market conditions. Increased competition may also result in lower prices and volumes, higher costs for resources, especially personnel, and, as a result, lower profitability. As a result, we may not be able to supply customers with services that they deem superior at competitive prices and may lose market share to our competitors. Any inability to face increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725
1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,Our business may be affected by political and economic uncertainty in Italy.,"Our revenues are derived almost entirely from customers located in Italy. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, revenues generated from customers in Italy 39 ----- accounted for 87%, 88%, 86% and 85% of our total revenues, respectively. As a result, macroeconomic conditions, market trends and customer demand in Italy impact our results of operations. Since 2017, economic growth in Italy has been slow. Italy’s GDP growth was 1.7%, 0.8% and 0.3% in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, compared to GDP growth in the European Union of 2.7%, 2.1% and 1.5% in the same years, respectively, in each case excluding the United Kingdom (source: EUROSTAT). Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian economy contracted sharply during the first half of 2020, recording a year-on-year contraction in GDP of 5.4% in the first quarter of 2020, thus entering a new recession, followed by a 12.8% year-on-year decrease in the second quarter of 2020, which was the worst year-on-year decrease of GDP since records began in 1995 (source: ISTAT) as the country was one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, Fitch Ratings downgraded Italy’s sovereign credit rating to BBB- from BBB while indicating a stable outlook, and affirmed such rating and outlook on July 10, 2020. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Moody’s Investors Service has not changed Italy’s sovereign credit rating which remains at Baa3 with a stable outlook. In April 2020, S&P Global Ratings confirmed Italy’s sovereign credit rating at BBB/A-2 while indicating a negative outlook. Continuing economic stagnation or renewed deterioration of the Italian economy, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in reduced capacity for investments in IT products and services, reducing in turn demand for our products and services. In addition, in a strong recessionary environment our access to financing could deteriorate and we might be unable to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, cash flows and prospects as well as our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes. In addition, business confidence in Italy may be negatively affected by continued political uncertainty. In September 2019, a coalition government composed of the center-left Democratic Party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement was sworn in. Such coalition government was formed on the back of the 2018 general election, in which no party won an outright majority, resulting in a hung parliament and leading to protracted negotiations to form a new government. These negotiations were concluded with the formation of a coalition government, composed of the anti-establishment League and Five Star Movement parties, which then collapsed in August 2019. It is unclear how long the current government will remain in office and whether it will be able to adequately address impediments to the country’s growth, including as a result of the COVID-pandemic, such as the ratio of sovereign debt to GDP, the write-down of non-performing loans and the reduction of unemployment in Italy. In addition, the government may take positions that further exacerbate economic uncertainty in Italy which, in turn, may give rise to a decrease in prices and profitability levels and have other material impacts on the IT Services and Software & Solutions markets. In addition, should the Italian government decide to discontinue any programs aimed at encouraging IT spend, including the “Impresa 4.0” digitalization plan, any such decision could reduce our customers’ IT spend, which in turn may give rise to a decrease in prices for our products and, as a result, reduce our profitability. Any of these events, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Areas of significant change include mobility, cloudbased computing, AI, digitalization and the processing and analysis of large and unstructured data (so-called big data analytics). Our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate these advances and trends and develop tailored new product and service offerings to meet our customers’ evolving needs.

These regulations govern, among other things, the provisions of some of our services as well as the development of some of our products, including our Proprietary Solutions, in particular software and digital solutions, and their utilization by our customers. In addition, in providing software, digital solutions and IT services to our customers, we often process, collect and store sensitive personal data of customers, business partners, employees, third parties and others (including, among others, name, address, age, and bank details) as part of the ordinary course of our business operations. We are therefore subject to data protection and privacy legislation, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) and the Italian Privacy Code (Legislative Decree No. 196/2003, as amended by Legislative Decree No. 101/2018, which adapted applicable Italian rules to GDPR). Such laws and regulations restrict our ability to collect, process and use personal data relating to customers, potential customers, business partners, and employees, including for marketing purposes. In particular, the GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018, and was immediately binding across all Member States of the European Union, increased both the number and the restrictive nature of the obligations applicable to us, with a focus on the collection, processing, use and transfer of personal data. The GDPR obligates European Union-based companies or companies that process personal data about European Union subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a large number of obligations, which relate, for example, to (i) the processing of personal data including transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security and confidentiality, (ii) the ability of the controller to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability), (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the processing and (iv) the rights of data subjects, such as, among others, transparency, a right of access, the right to rectification and the right to erasure. The GDPR obligates companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies or types of data. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in significant penalties including fines of up to 4% of total annual worldwide turnover or €20 million (whichever is higher), depending on the type and severity of the breach. The fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease processing). Our data security insurance coverage is limited and we cannot guarantee that our data security insurance coverage or our general liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all or any liabilities in the event of a breach of our data security systems. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any applicable data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings, investigations or other actions (including class actions) brought against us by governmental entities and agencies or private individuals and entities, which may result in significant fines, penalties, judgments and reputational damages to our business, and require us to change business practices and increase the costs and complexity of compliance, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, evolving regulation relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs and affect or limit the way through which we collect, process, use, store and transfer personal data. Compliance with, and monitoring of such laws and regulations is demanding, time consuming and costly. Further, such laws and regulations, including their interpretation and application, change from time to time, and such changes could impose new burdens and expose us to further liability, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, in the aftermath of temporary personnel initiatives implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as a reliance on remote working, as well as an increased amount of employee health data being processed, our exposure to this risk is temporarily heightened. Any changes in these laws and regulations or procedural rules, such as those governing public procurement and tender processes, could reduce the profitability of our products and, in exceptional cases, could render the market introduction of a new product unprofitable. Any failure to comply with the applicable regulations, including by third-party licensees, partners and customers, could result in fines, enforcement actions by governments or competent authorities, injunctions or other measures which could result in reputational harm, reduced sales and market share and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2019 and in the six months 41 ----- ended June 30, 2020, revenues from our Telco & Media industry declined due to the significant reduction in volumes generated on Mobile VAS, a platform enabling mobile operators to sell value-added products and services to customers with subscriptions, resulting from restrictions imposed by the competent Italian authorities on the use of services through the Mobile VAS platform by such mobile operators.

Projects involving governments or governmental agencies carry various risks inherent in the government contracting process, including the following: - government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination; - terms and conditions of contracts with public sector entities tend to be more onerous than other contracts and may include, among other things, extensive rights of audit, more punitive service-level penalties and other restrictive covenants; - contractual non-compliance (including improper billing), failure to comply with procurement regulations and regulation regarding the protection of classified information, and other improper or illegal activities, may result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government, in addition to other typical remedies for breach of contract, which may include termination of the relevant contracts, forfeiture of profits and suspension of payments; - government contracts are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other contracts. Any negative publicity related to such contracts, regardless of the accuracy of such publicity, may adversely affect our business and reputation; - participation in government contracts could subject us to stricter regulatory requirements, which may increase our cost of compliance; - political and economic factors, such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision-makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues, can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid for, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed; - government contracts may involve multiple parties in the delivery of services and require greater project management efforts on our part, and any failure in this regard may adversely impact our performance and reputation; - litigation or disputes with government and public entities may lead to us being banned from contracting with other government and public entities or participating in public tenders, which would have both an economic and a reputational impact on us; and - public sector-related customers sometimes follow payment management processes that are subject to review by other government authorities or other entities, which may cause delays or adjustments to their own payment schedule. This dynamic creates seasonality in our cash flows, which could give rise to liquidity problems during the periods when collection associated with projects are structurally lower. 42 ----- If one or more of the foregoing risks were to materialize, they could have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

In particular, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 9, 2020, the Italian government imposed a nationwide quarantine together with several other measures, which have had a material adverse impact on the overall Italian economy and, as a result, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. As a result of these restrictive measures, we closed substantially all of our facilities in Italy and internationally, while maintaining a limited number of employees in business-critical functions on site to operate our data centers, and transitioned all of our remaining employees to remote working. Additionally, even though the nationwide quarantine was lifted on May 4, 2020, significant restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall Italian economy and, in turn, our operations. Our operations are primarily based in Italy, and if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work effectively due to prolonged illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions, facility closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations could be materially impacted. We may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and carry out new sales activity, and some of our costs may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. In addition, as a result of social distancing measures and restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our customers may not be able to operate their businesses for a prolonged and indeterminate period of time, which, if materialized, will likely impact our operations. Additionally, it is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19, further waves of infection, or a renewed or extended lock-down, if materialized, will cause further disruption in our business operations, cause delay, or limit the ability of, municipal customers and other customers to perform under their existing contracts, including making timely payments to us, and cause other unpredictable events. Customers may experience significant losses due to the COVID-19 outbreak and may terminate their existing contracts or postpone or ultimately cancel future planned orders and contracts due to those losses. Both domestic and international travel may be further restricted to certain areas which may limit our ability to obtain new customers and enter new markets, to provide services in the areas in which our customers are currently located or otherwise conduct our operations as we would do under normal circumstances. To the extent our activities are disrupted by restrictions imposed by governments or other authorities to address the risk of transmission of COVID-19, or by changes in customer behavior, this may result in a loss of customers, and our future rate of growth may slow compared to the past. The general economic impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on the communities that we serve may result in customers not being able to continue to pay for our IT software, services and solutions or deciding to postpone, cancel or reduce their investment in IT software, services and solutions. This could result in an increase in bad debts and cancellations, as well as in a reduction or delay in revenue collection, which could impact our liquidity, cash flow, profitability and attrition rate negatively. The disruptions triggered by COVID-19 in countries where our suppliers and customers are located, such as Italy, may result in a slow-down of their production activities and other disruptions, any of which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. In addition, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 outbreak by European Union institutions as well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the future, including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of European integration. It is unclear whether measures taken by European Union institutions, the Italian government and other governments of the countries in which we operate to contain the COVID-19 outbreak are adequate and will be effective in achieving their goals. It is unclear when, if at all, the COVID-19 outbreak will be contained. We cannot guarantee that COVID-19 or any future outbreak of another virus or other contagious disease will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects our business, results of operations and financial condition depends on several factors, such as the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, any additional periods of lockdown in Italy and/or the countries in which our customers are located, and the pace at which demand, pricing and, in general, economic and operating conditions will stabilize and recover in the countries where we operate, including Italy. Any future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and 43 ----- duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects, as well as our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Additionally, an increase in our accounts receivable and in our provisions for bad debt, may negatively affect our working capital and lead us to experience liquidity constraints.","From time to time, we carry significant accounts receivable balances from customers that generate a large portion of our revenues. While we closely monitor timely payment of our accounts receivable, a customer may become unable or unwilling to pay its balance on time due to, among other reasons, an economic weakness in its industry or the financial insolvency of its business. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our average days sales outstanding (DSOs) in trade receivables, excluding the effect of non-recourse sales of receivables, was approximately 218 days. Any increase in our DSOs due to delays in payments could negatively impact our liquidity. In addition, we account for possible write-downs of our accounts receivable from customers through the creation of a bad debt provision. As of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and as at the six months ended June 30, 2020, the amount we allocated to doubtful debt provisions with respect to receivables from customers were €46.4 million, €39.3 million, €54.4 million and €54.1 million, respectively. These amounts primarily relate to unpaid invoices by Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. See “Business—Legal Proceedings” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Net Working _Capital.” If our provisions for bad debt increase significantly, including as a result of the impact of COVID-19,_ this may have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows. Historically, we have engaged in spot sale of trade receivables to manage our working capital in peak periods. In particular, in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the six months ended June 30, 2020, we sold €107.7 million, €155.9 million, €155.3 million and €74.3 million, respectively, of trade receivables. Following the completion of the Transactions, we intend to primarily rely on our operating cash flow as well as our Revolving Credit Facility to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity needs. There can be no assurance that our operating cash flow, together with amounts available under our Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements. In addition, if we decide to engage in sales of our trade receivables in the future, the potentially impaired credit worthiness of our customers in light of the COVID-19 pandemic may make it more difficult or costly for us to do so, which could in turn harm our liquidity position to the extent other credit lines will not be available at that time for any reasons. More generally, delays in payments by our largest customers, requests for modifications to their contractual payment arrangements or defaults on their payment obligations to us could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

This risk is increased as a result of our frequent acquisitions. Certain entities that we acquired in the past did not have internal control procedures of an effectiveness equivalent to ours.

For example, we are currently involved in a dispute with Pradac Informatica S.r.l. (“Pradac”), who is claiming damages for abuse of economic dependence. In addition, we are currently involved in a dispute against Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Siciliana for unpaid invoices. As of June 30, 2020, our total exposure to Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Siciliana amounted to €59.7 million. For a description of these and other material ongoing legal proceedings, see “Business—Legal Proceedings.” In the aftermath of public health measures implemented in the jurisdictions in which we operate as well as our 44 ----- temporary personnel initiatives due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could be subject to an increase in litigation, in particular in relation to our vendors and our employees, including with respect to health and safety measures. In the course of our business, we are also subject to other proceedings, such as regulatory and tax investigations and audits as well as inspections by tax and other regulatory authorities, which may expose us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including penalties and suspension or disqualification from procurement contracting. For example, in 2019 we incurred fines in connection with a reassessment of past income taxes in an amount of €2.7 million. In addition, we are typically required to comply with certain quality standards in connection with the provision of certain services to our customers and, pursuant to some of our contracts, our customers are entitled to certain audit rights in regards to our compliance with such standards. Any finding of our non-compliance resulting from these audits could result in breach of contract claims and negative publicity which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Any contact by our directors, employees, agents or partners with the public administration (including in the context of participations in auctions, interactions held with the public administration in the process of obtaining or renewing any authorization or license and any possible public contribution) involves risks associated with fraud, bribery, corruption, incorrect use of public contributions and other fraudulent activities by our employees and related investigations. We are also exposed to the risk that our directors, employees or agents commit IT related crimes, which may consist of using our infrastructure to violate the IT systems of our competitors, unlawful access to banking data (including that of our customers) and damage the IT systems and documents.

Such claims may be substantial and may result in adverse publicity for us. Our business activities may also involve risks related to possible accidents, which may be due to our employees’ activities or mistakes and may consist in crimes, breaches of security measures, damages to third parties or manslaughter.

We may be unable to detect or prevent every instance of such conduct involving our directors, employees, consultants, partners, agents and third party agents’ representatives and intermediaries and/or fail to adequately update and implement such monitoring systems. In addition, our monitoring systems (including our internal whistleblowing procedures, our internal policies, our management and organizational model pursuant to LD 231/2001 and our risk management system) may not be sufficient to prevent, detect and identify inadequate practices, and violation of law by such individuals, especially given our profile, size as well as in light of the extent of our cooperation with them.

The materialization of any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. On June 23, 2020, the Company received notice that an investigation was being undertaken by authorities in Italy involving Azienda Trasporti Milanesi S.p.A. (“ATM”), the company wholly owned by the municipality of Milan (Comune di Milano) that manages the Milan metro system, as well as eight other companies, including the Company. The investigation involves allegations that certain public tenders involving ATM were impacted by improper benefits provided by employees of the companies under investigation, including certain employees of the Company. In connection with the investigation, on June 23, 2020, two employees of the Company were initially taken into custody and two other employees of the Company were placed under house arrest. In relation to such events, the relevant authorities are also investigating the Company as well as the other companies for alleged violations of LD 231/2001, the Italian law on corporate liability for crimes, and in particular corruption, and requested access to certain of the Company’s offices as well as certain documents and records of the Company on June 23, 2020. Furthermore, on July 21, 2020, the Company was informed that three additional employees were subject to the investigation. The employees under investigation include (i) the head of the Company’s transportation business sub-segment, who was appointed to this position in September 2019, after the occurrence of the events under investigation as well as (ii) six other employees in the transportation sub-segment. The pretrial hearings for the gathering of evidence before the beginning of the criminal proceeding (incidente _probatorio) are currently scheduled for October 2020 but may be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic._ The Company anticipates that up to two of its employees could provide evidence during these pretrial hearings. At this time, it is not possible to predict when the final verdict, if any, will emerge. Although the investigation is currently ongoing and at a preliminary stage, and the possible outcome of such investigation or any potential civil, administrative or criminal prosecution or sanctions of the Company’s employees or the Company is not known, in the event we were held responsible for criminal activities or violations of relevant anti-corruption laws, we may be subject to fines, confiscation of profits or legal sanctions, including the termination of authorizations, permits, licenses or concessions, and including, potentially, suspension of operations or disqualification from contracting with public authorities (either across the board or at the discretion of such public authorities on a case-by-case basis). Such sanctions, fines and other measures, 46 ----- including operational bans, might be imposed on a precautionary basis (e.g., ordered by the competent authorities pending the investigation phase, thus before a first instance decision on the case has been issued), and the mere existence of the investigation may harm our reputation with our existing and future customers and lead to the loss of existing or future business. Given the uncertainty of the situation, other risks which the Company considers unlikely to have a significant impact, such as loss of competitiveness in tenders, precautionary exclusion from tenders by public authorities and/or other private and public entities or loss of existing contracts, cannot be completely eliminated. For example, on July 9, 2020, ATM terminated its two existing contracts with the Company and one existing contract with its subsidiary, Engineering 365, which we estimate collectively accounted for approximately €0.7 million of revenues over the last three years. In addition, on September 4, 2020, Metropolitana Milanese, a company wholly owned by the municipality of Milan (Comune di Milano), excluded the Group from two different tenders relating to (i) workplace and fleet management services (with a total tender value of approximately €2.4 million over 42 months) and (ii) management and evolution services of its ICT applications and infrastructures (with a total tender value of approximately €14.9 million over 63 months). Work from public tenders comprises an important part of the Company’s business and should the ongoing investigation result in a loss by the Group of competitiveness in tenders, the precautionary exclusion of the Group from ongoing and future tenders by public authorities including CONSIP and/or other private and public entities, the discretionary or automatic termination of existing contracts, authorizations, permits, licenses or concessions, the execution of performance or bid bonds by the contracting entity, and including, potentially, the suspension of operations or disqualification from contracting with public contracting entities (either as a general prohibition or at the discretion of the individual public contracting entity on a case-by-case basis). these consequences may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations, in particular in respect of our business from public administration customers.

Consolidation trends in our industry may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader geographic footprint, better technologies and greater price efficiencies entering or servicing the markets in which we operate. This trend could create opportunities for large enterprise software and hardware companies, including our partners, to increase their market share including through the acquisition of companies that are strong in certain lucrative market niches or that have broad installed customer bases.

As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the increased use of mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services in recent years, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases. Such breaches and cyberattacks could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data of, among others, our employees, customers, contractors, vendors and other business partners, as well as personal data stored on our products or through our services by our customers, which may result in damage to our reputation and brand and adversely affect our relationships with our customers. Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving and have increased in sophistication and speed in recent years, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on one of our customers and its customers. The risk of such attacks includes breaches and attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also of those of our customers, employees, contractors, business partners, vendors and other 47 ----- third parties as well as of third-party systems on which we rely to operate our digital platforms. Successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of our data or systems or those of our customers or other third parties, theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means, and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. Furthermore, certain industries in which our customers operate, including the healthcare and finance industries, require heightened standards for the handling of sensitive data and can be subject to regulatory overview, which can result in an increase in our compliance expenses and negative publicity for our products and services in case of a breach or attempted breach. In the event of such actions, we, our customers and other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as to the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. We also experience and respond to cybersecurity threats from time to time. As our business and the cybersecurity landscape evolve, we may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. However, there can be no assurance that such investments will prevent future cyberattacks or other threats from occurring which may result in material adverse effects on our business and operations. In addition, the trend to publicize vulnerabilities discovered in our industry increases the risks posed by these attacks and the potential costs that we, our partners and/or our customers might have to incur to respond and remediate to any of such attacks. Any of the foregoing, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Our contracts for the provision of services often guarantee only minimal downtime of the services that we provide. In particular, we are dependent on the uninterrupted performance of our four data centers, which are central to the IT infrastructure and services we offer to our customers and on which we rely for our own operations. We also rely on uninterrupted access to the wider power and telecommunications network, and any significant failure, damage or destruction of the basic infrastructure such as power and telecommunications systems in the locations in which we operate, could affect the quality of our services and cause service interruption. Our infrastructure may be damaged in natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods or fires, due to wars or terrorist attacks, or be subject to damage or compromise from human error, technical disruptions, unauthorized access, power failure, computer glitches and viruses, telecommunications failures, adverse weather conditions and other unforeseen events. Any of such events may cause disruptions to information systems for sustained periods, result in system interruptions outages or delays in our systems or deterioration in their performance, which could impair our ability to operate our business. As many of our services play a business-critical role for our customers, any damage to or failure of the infrastructure we rely on (even if temporary), could disrupt our ability to deliver information to and provide services for our customers in a timely manner. Enhancing our IT systems and applications to achieve improved stability and redundancy, as well as putting in place remedies to resolve a disruption or other interruption of our IT services, may be time-consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain. If we are unable to invest in maintaining and improving our IT systems and applications, the likelihood of the occurrence of system interruptions may increase. While we have developed certain contingency and disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of these types of events, such plans and systems might not be fully redundant or sufficient. Our data centers’ redundancy mechanisms could fail, resulting in damages, data loss, service interruptions and other disruptions of our IT systems and applications, any of which could severely affect our ability to operate our business. In addition, our property damage insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the costs of repairing the damage caused from such disruptive events or such events may only partially be covered under our policies or not at all. If we are unable to operate our business as a result of any significant or sustained interruption of our technical infrastructure could have a negative effect on our services and result in damages for breach of contract, litigation, reputational damage and could ultimately result in the loss of current and/or potential customers or in reduced business from current customers which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 48 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

In general, system implementation, migrations and integrations can be impacted by unforeseen challenges in delivering solutions on time and to budget. Due to the length and complexity of some implementations and the ongoing evolution of product cycles, we may face unforeseen issues with service deliveries that can have an adverse impact on customer satisfaction and profitability. If our customers are dissatisfied with the quality of our services and decide to terminate the integration of our products with their existing systems, we may incur costs that we would not be able to offset with revenues we were expecting to generate from such services. If we do not provide effective or timely ongoing support, our ability to sell additional services to existing customers or our ability to retain such customers may be adversely affected and our reputation within the market, including with potential customers, could be damaged. In addition, support for the majority of our services and solutions can be provided by third-parties, and our failure to meet our clients’ expectations may result in thirdparties capturing a portion of revenue streams generated from support operations on our products and services. In addition, to the extent that we are unsuccessful in hiring, training and retaining adequate support resources, our ability to provide adequate and timely support and maintenance services to our customers will be negatively impacted, and our customers’ satisfaction with our services may be adversely affected.

Furthermore, we operate and provide services to customers in sensitive environments, such as to our customers in our Finance, Health and Energy & Utilities industry verticals, the specificities of which continuously expose us to factors outside of our control that may negatively affect our reputation. Adverse publicity, legal action or other factors could lead to substantial erosion in the value of our brand, which could lead to decreased demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Between 2017 and 2020, we acquired 21 businesses. Some of these acquisitions were material, including the acquisitions of Infogroup in 2017, and of Deus Technology, Cybertech Group and Municipia Mobilità in 2019. Despite our successful track-record of acquisition and integration of new businesses into our operations, there can be no guarantee that we will continue to be able to successfully identify suitable acquisitions or complete any particular acquisition, combination or other transaction on acceptable terms, which could prevent us from achieving our strategic goals. Our ability to acquire new businesses may be limited by many factors, including availability of financing or its conditions, debt covenants, complex ownership structures among potential targets and government regulation and competition from other potential acquirers. In addition, our debt burden may increase if we borrow funds to finance any future acquisition, which could have a negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to finance our overall operations and pay interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, which may disrupt our day-to-day business and divert management’s attention, and we may not be able to manage the integration process successfully. Even if we are successful in acquiring new businesses, the integration of such businesses may prove to be more difficult than we initially anticipated and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Integrations can be difficult and unpredictable also as a result of the complexity of software and 49 ----- due to the fact that acquired technologies are typically developed independently and may not have been designed to integrate with our products. Such difficulties are compounded when the products involved are wellestablished, as compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved, and/or when the size of the acquired business is significant as compared to our size. Successful integration also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams, which could be difficult and unpredictable due to cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps. Acquisitions also pose certain other risks, for example, difficulties or delays in consolidating operations and achieving anticipated synergies, cost savings, revenues and cash flow enhancements, growth, operational efficiencies and other benefits, diversion of managerial resources away from our day-to-day business operations, overpayment for the acquired business, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities to the extent that we issue new shares to fund an acquisition and the assumption of unexpected liabilities and undisclosed risks. Certain contracts of the businesses acquired by us contain “change of control” provisions that require the acquired company to notify the counterparty of a potential change of control, or contain language that could be interpreted as allowing, subject to certain conditions, the counterparty to terminate the contract. Although the agreements governing certain of our acquisitions require the target to use commercially reasonable endeavors to obtain consents or waivers relating to such “change of control” provisions prior to closing of the acquisitions, such consents and waivers are generally not a condition to closing. If a substantial number of these contracts have been, are or will be terminated as a result of our acquisition, we may be forced to enter into new contracts on less favorable terms, or we may be unable to secure replacements. While we strive to mitigate unexpected liabilities and risks through contractual protections in our acquisition documentation, we cannot ensure that such protections will be effective. In addition, if we enter into an acquisition agreement but the acquisition is not consummated, we may be liable for break-up fees or other payments, which may, in some cases, be material and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Finally, certain of the businesses we have acquired are operated through strategic partnerships with other investors who hold a non-controlling interest in the relevant company and might have interests conflicting with ours. See also “—Certain of our subsidiaries have non-controlling shareholders whose interests may differ from _ours.

The rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors, including: - general economic, political and market conditions; - customers’ perceptions of our ability to add value through our services; - our customers’ desire or need to control or reduce their costs; - the general competitive environment in our industry (including new competitors entering the market); - the introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors; - public appropriations for IT spending; and - the procurement practices of customers and their use of third party advisors. Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is also dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs, including personnel costs, which accounted for 54% of our total operating expenses in the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and our resource capacity, including staff utilization levels. We have implemented and continue to implement new remote-working policies in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak.

In the year ended December 31, 2019, our largest customer and our top ten customers accounted for 8% and 34% of our revenues, respectively. We operate our business on the basis of framework agreements with our public sector customers. Framework agreements with our public sector customers typically have a duration of between two and five years. Contracts with our private sector customers typically have a duration of between one and three years. Our customers are generally required to pay us within 60 days from receipt of the relevant invoice. Moreover, most of our contracts, including our framework agreements with entities in the public sector, do not require the customer to commit a minimum amount of revenues. Our customers typically have no obligation to renew their contracts with us upon expiration, and even if they do, they may not renew with a similar contract period or with the same or a greater amount of committed revenues to us. In particular, our customers may decide not to renew their contracts with us if they are dissatisfied with our services, our prices or the actual or perceived quality, durability or security of our software or platforms. Additionally, our success also depends on relationships we develop with our customers that enable us to understand our customers’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to meet those needs. Since we usually provide our customers with products and services relating to a combination of our Proprietary Solutions, Application Transformations and Managed Services, the loss of a major customer, or a significant reduction in volume of business from an existing major customer, for instance as a result of such customer being dissatisfied with the quality of our work, our failure to meet performance standards under our contracts, or our non-compliance with the provisions of our contractual agreements or applicable regulatory requirements, may result in our inability to sell additional services to such customer, the loss of business volume from such customer or the loss of the customer altogether. In addition, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could cause a reduction in business volume from a customer or the loss of a customer, including reduced technology spending in response to a challenging economic or competitive environment, consolidation, business or financial deterioration or failure and, in the case of public sector contracts, a decrease in public IT spending appropriations.

Competitive bidding imposes substantial costs and presents a number of risks, including: the substantial cost and managerial time and effort that we spend to prepare bids and proposals, for contracts that may or may not be awarded to us; the need to accurately estimate the resources and costs that will be required to implement and service any contracts we are awarded, sometimes in advance of the final determination of their full scope and design and to consider such estimated resources and costs in the context of a competitive tender process in order to submit a price quote that is competitive but not so low as to be loss-making if we win the bid, and the opportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts that we might otherwise pursue. Over the past few years, and mostly for central government activities, there has been a shift in the manner public administration and healthcare tenders are run, from a fragmented approach, whereby the relevant local public administration or other public entity launches a local tender to satisfy its individual IT services requirements, to a more integrated approach, whereby centralized purchasing agencies consolidate the purchasing function of the individual public administrations through the execution of framework agreements. Such agencies, including CONSIP, function as a centralized purchasing agency on behalf of many public administrations and healthcare customers and manage any relevant public tenders. In addition, if any bids are unsuccessful, we may from time to time challenge tender procedures or outcomes, which could result in significant litigation costs and management time expended on the litigation. For example, in 2013 we challenged a tender procedure published by Consip S.p.A., which resulted in the tender 51 ----- procedure being amended. In 2015 Cap Gemini filed a claim against Consip S.p.A. moving for our exclusion from a tender which had been awarded to us. Additionally, we recently won a public tender for the development of Italian public broadcaster RAI’s IT infrastructure which was challenged by the incumbent service provider. Similarly, in 2019 we won a public tender for the development of logistic support and fine management services to be provided to the Municipal Police of Turin, which was challenged by our competitor Poste Italiane S.p.A.. Challenges can be time-consuming for management, and divert their attention from day-to-day operation of our business, as well as costly, and there can be no guarantee that a challenge will be successful. Similarly, competitors frequently challenge contracts awarded to us under competitive public tenders. For instance, in 2018 Enterprise Services Italia, our customer’s incumbent supplier, challenged the outcome in our favor of a tender process, asking for the tender process to be annulled. We were not successful in defending this claim. In the same year, Tesi Elettronica e Sistemi Informativi S.p.A. filed a claim in relation to a separate tender process. We were successful in defending this claim. In addition, any claims for alleged misrepresentations in our bids and proposals could also result in litigation as well as in our exclusion from awarded tender procedures and bans from participating in ongoing and future tenders. We may be required to incur significant costs and divert management’s attention to defend ourselves against these challenges. Such costs can be material and involve subsequent litigation that can take years to resolve. If any of these challenges is successful, we may be required to resubmit our bid or the awarded contract may be terminated or amounts payable thereunder may be reduced, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have filed various applications for the registration of our intellectual property in Italy and in certain other jurisdictions in which we operate.

Certain IFRS standards have been recently revised by the IASB. Notably, the effectiveness of IFRS 16 (from January 1, 2019), IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 (from January 1, 2018) have had an impact on the manner in which we carry out our financial reporting. In particular, IFRS 16 had an impact on our reported assets, liabilities and income statement as we recognized new assets and liabilities for our operating leases, IFRS 15 had an impact on our revenue recognition, and IFRS 9 had an impact on recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and derecognition of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting.

We perform goodwill, trademark and other intangible assets impairment testing on an annual basis, and we did not incur in impairment losses on goodwill, trademark and other intangible assets in the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 and in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill, trademark or other intangible assets is necessary, we would have to record the appropriate charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

In addition, the contractual arrangements with such non-controlling shareholders may require us to purchase shares at predetermined prices under certain put and call options and to make payments under certain earn-out arrangements.","We operate a number of our businesses through strategic partnerships with other investors who hold a non-controlling interest in the relevant business. Our relationships with these strategic partners are governed by various contractual arrangements, which regulate, inter alia, the corporate governance, management and administration of such businesses. In certain circumstances, certain material decisions regarding such subsidiaries’ operations, such as capital increases, relocation of corporate domicile and other relevant matters, require the consent of non-controlling shareholders. In selected cases, we have also undertaken to make yearly 57 ----- dividend distributions. Our strategic partners may not necessarily share our views on the manner in which the relevant business should operate and may exercise their rights in a manner which is adverse to us, which, in turn, may adversely affect our business. Moreover, if we are unable to resolve such conflicts of interest or disputes with strategic partners in an amicable way, we may be required to initiate legal proceedings, which would require us to incur significant costs and expose us to substantially uncertain outcomes. As a result, any disputes with our strategic partners could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the contractual arrangements with such non-controlling shareholders may require us to purchase shares at predetermined prices under certain put and call options and to make payments under certain earn out arrangements. Our overall liability with respect to such put and call option relating to non-controlling holdings of certain Group companies (the “Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries”) is accounted for as other non-current liabilities in our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2020, amounted to €37.7 million (on a discounted basis). The Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries reflect our estimate of discounted future disbursements in connection with such options, based on the applicable contractual provisions. The value of the Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries is subject to change over time as the exercise price of each put and call option and earn out arrangement is dependent on, among other things, the performance of the relevant company in a given future period, which could differ from the performance that we estimate when determining the Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries for accounting purposes. If the value of the Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries changes, the change is accounted for in our income statement as finance income (if the value of the Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries decreases) or finance expense (if the value of the Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries increases). If we underestimate the value of the Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries for any reasons, our financial liabilities would be higher than the ones reported in our consolidated financial statements and the cash amounts we would be required to pay our strategic partners would be higher than expected. If we are required to make any such payments, our liquidity position would be adversely affected. In addition, we may not have available cash on our balance sheet to acquire the relevant non-controlling interests at the time we are contractually required to do so and we may otherwise be unable to obtain financing at favorable terms and conditions or at all.

Typically, while our cash collection is stable during the first two quarters of each year on the back of the ongoing fees we receive by customers under all our ongoing contracts, our cash collection usually peaks during the fourth quarter of each year due to the finalization of accounts and payment of invoices by our customers in anticipation of the end of the financial year. Our cash collection is typically lowest during the third quarter of each year due primarily to extended school holidays in Italy during the month of August. Our billing cycle and the recognition of revenues in our income statement is typically subject to similar seasonal drivers, with a stable level of revenues recorded in the first two quarters of each year, when we collect purchase orders from customers, and the highest revenues recorded during the third and fourth quarter of each year when we typically issue invoices to our customers in connection with the formalization of purchase orders as binding contracts and the finalization of our yearly accounts. These drivers cause differences in our revenues among the various quarters of any financial year, which means that the individual quarters of a year may not be directly compared with each other or used to predict annual financial results. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 58 ----- _Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Revenue generation, cash collection and billing patterns.”_ In addition, the sales cycles across our industry verticals is typically long, with the time between the receipt of purchase orders, the date a contract is entered into and the beginning of the provision of services ranging from an average of six months for private sector customers to one to two years for contracts awarded under public tenders. Customers may terminate their contracts prior to execution thereof, in which case the costs we incurred prior to termination might not be entirely recoverable, if at all. Moreover, the internal budget and approval processes of our prospective customers make it difficult to predict the timing of new client engagements. Also, since we recognize revenues only upon actual provision of the contracted services and when the criteria for recognition are achieved in accordance with IFRS, the financial benefit of gaining a new client may not be realized at the intended time due to delays in the implementation of our services or to an increase in the start-up costs required in building our infrastructure. Any of these factors, individually or in the aggregate, may make it difficult for us to prepare accurate internal financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenues that are not realized as a result of these delays, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, historically, from time to time, to even out our cash generation cycle and to manage our working capital and other liquidity needs, we engaged in the sale of receivables, also through spot sales of receivables.

As of June 30, 2020, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, we would have had total third-party financial indebtedness outstanding in the amount of €651.3 million, including €605.0 million representing the aggregate principal amount of Notes and €38.4 million representing the aggregate principal amount of our New Term Loan. In addition, we have €160.0 million of available revolving credit under our Revolving Credit Facility, which we expect to be undrawn on the Issue Date. Following the Issue Date, we expect to enter into a facilities agreement with Banco BPM S.p.A. which will provide for term loans in an aggregate principal amount of €15.0 million. We anticipate that we will continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. See “Capitalization,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Transactions could have important consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to: - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes, the New Term Loan, the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt and liabilities we may incur; - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payments in respect of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, or other general corporate purposes; - restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; 61 ----- - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate; - negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors; and - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any future borrowings. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations, including under the Notes. Although the terms of the Indenture limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, such limitations are subject to exceptions and qualifications and the incurrence of additional indebtedness would exacerbate the risks above. Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet our other obligations and commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose. We cannot assure you that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The Issuer will be, and following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo will in part be, dependent upon the cash flows from its operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends, principal repayments under the Funding Loan or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. See “—The Issuer’s right to receive payments under the Funding Loan prior to the _Post-Completion Merger (if it occurs) may be subordinated by law to the obligations of other creditors.” The_ amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend, and following the Post-Completion Merger the amounts of dividends and distributions available to MergerCo will in part depend, on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or otherwise transfer funds directly or indirectly to the Issuer or MergerCo, as applicable. Furthermore, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Issue Date and the Company provides the Guarantee and the Company Collateral in respect of the Notes, all or a portion of its distributable profits and available reserves will, pursuant to the Whitewash Procedure, be set aside to provide the Guarantee and the Company Collateral to the Notes, as well as the guarantee to be provided by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan, and, therefore, the Company may not have distributable profits and available reserves in order to make distributions to the Issuer. See also “—Risks Related to the Notes, the _Guarantee and the Collateral—Once granted, the Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.” More generally, the Issuer’s or, following the_ Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo’s, subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer or to MergerCo, as applicable, which could adversely affect the Issuer’s (or, following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo’s) ability to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including payments in respect of the Notes. In particular, various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash to the Issuer and, following the Post-Completion Merger, to MergerCo. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable laws may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries or, following the PostCompletion Merger, MergerCo’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer or to MergerCo, as applicable, will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their debt when due. In addition, the aggregate amount of the Funding Loan is €114.4 million, which is significantly lower than the aggregate principal amounts of the Notes, and interest on the Funding Loan accrues at a rate equal to the three month EURIBOR plus 5.50% per annum. Accordingly, prior to the Post-Completion Merger, the 62 ----- ability of the Issuer to make payments under the Notes will largely depend on the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to it, which will be subject to the risks described above and could be inefficient from a tax perspective. Following the Post Completion Merger the above-mentioned risks will apply to MergerCo. If we are unable to complete the Post-Completion Merger and the Company cannot or is otherwise unable to complete the Whitewash Procedure, the Notes may not benefit from any Guarantee for their entire life. Following the Post-Completion Merger, none of the subsidiaries of MergerCo is expected to guarantee the Notes. In either case, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes and, following the Post-Completion Merger, all of the subsidiaries of MergerCo, will have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes, and, accordingly, the Issuer or MergerCo, as applicable, will rely on the ability of its respective subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to it in order to be able to service the Notes. While the Indenture limits the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries or, following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo’s subsidiaries, to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Although the Indenture, the New Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions is substantial. If additional debt is incurred, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Indenture, the New Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.

These agreements limit our ability to, among other things: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock; - make certain restricted payments and investments; - transfer or sell assets; - enter into transactions with affiliates; - create or incur certain liens; - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions; - issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries; - create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us; - take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral; - merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and - pay or redeem subordinated debt or repurchase equity. All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the _Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to operate our_ 63 ----- business, to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative covenants while the Revolving Credit Facility remains outstanding. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the_ Revolving Credit Facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet such financial ratio. While failure to satisfy the financial ratio shall not directly or indirectly constitute, or result in a default or event of default, it would result in a draw stop for any new utilizations under the Revolving Credit Facility thereby potentially adversely impacting our liquidity. Subject to the foregoing, a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could, subject to the applicable cure period, result in an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is continuing under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement the relevant creditors are entitled to cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and/or elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default, event of default and/or acceleration action under the Revolving Credit Facility could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions, including (in the case of acceleration of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility) the Indenture and the New Term Loan. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes and the New Term Loan, or to fund our other liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Revolving Credit Facility. At the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility (which is three months prior to the maturity of the Notes), the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. If this is the case, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, 64 ----- including the Notes, the Indenture, the New Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations, which could cause an event of default under our debt and result in: - our debt holders declaring all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable; - the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the lender under the New Term Loan Agreement being able to terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing our borrowings; and - our being forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in you losing your investment in the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The New Term Loan will bear a variable rate based on the EURIBOR plus an applicable margin and the Revolving Credit Facility will bear a variable rate based on the EURIBOR or (as applicable) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), in each case plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither the Indenture, the New Term Loan Agreement nor the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements, that hedges might not be available for the full amount or term of the borrowings, that break clauses might be required or that hedges will limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in interest rates. To the extent interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. Further, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Notes). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. 65 ----- If we determine that EURIBOR or LIBOR have been permanently discontinued or, at the request of the Issuer or the agent (acting on the instructions of the majority lenders), the agent will use an alternative reference rate in the manner as described in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the New Term Loan Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon the amount of its obligations and upon applicable laws. The Guarantee of the Company and of any other subsidiary which might be required in the future to become a Guarantor under the Indenture will be limited as set forth in “Certain Insolvency Law _Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of subsidiaries of the Issuer, including the Company prior to the granting of its Guarantee in the event that the PostCompletion Merger has not occurred as mentioned above, and non-Guarantor subsidiaries of MergerCo following the Merger Date, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors of the Issuer, MergerCo or the Guarantor, as the case may be.

Our estimation of the timing required to complete the Post-Completion Merger is based upon market practice for leveraged buyouts in Italy, which typically involves acquisition vehicles in the form of joint stock companies (società per azioni) where an independent expert is required to be appointed by the court, which creates an inherent uncertainty as to the length 67 ----- of time in which the Post-Completion Merger can be expected to take place.

The obligations of the Guarantor, the enforcement of the Guarantee and the obligations of the grantor of security and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce on the Collateral will be limited under the Indenture to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the Guarantor or provided by the grantor of security under the applicable laws of Italy, which has been determined so as to ensure that amounts payable will not result in violations of laws related to, among others, corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation, financial assistance or transactions under value, or otherwise cause the Guarantor to be deemed insolvent under applicable law or such Guarantee to be deemed void, unenforceable or ultra vires, or cause the directors of such Guarantor to be held in breach of applicable laws for providing such Guarantee. In particular, enforcement of the Guarantee or Collateral against the Guarantor or the relevant security grantor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Guarantee or pledges of security designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the Guarantor or relevant security grantors. These laws and defenses include those 68 ----- that relate to fraudulent conveyances or transfers, insolvency, voidable preferences, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws and regulation or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, the liability of the Guarantor under its Guarantee or of a grantor of security could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on the amounts of its other obligations and the law applicable to it. In addition, to the extent the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Issue Date, the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company to implement the Whitewash Procedure in order to provide the Guarantee and to grant the Company Collateral, as well as the guarantee to be granted by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan. Such Guarantee, the Company Collateral and the guarantee to be granted by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan will be (prior to the completion of the Post-Completion Merger) limited to the accrued profits and/or available reserves set aside for such purpose in connection with the Whitewash Procedure and shall also be subject to the additional limitations set out below. Pursuant to, and in order to comply with, the Whitewash Procedure that is envisaged to be implemented by the Company, the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of the Guarantee issued by the Company shall not exceed, on an aggregate basis together with any proceeds deriving from the enforcement of the Collateral granted by the Company and the guarantee to be granted by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan, the limit of the relevant company’s credit support approved pursuant to the Whitewash Procedure. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on _the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ Furthermore, pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 2358 of the Italian Civil Code, the actual amount of credit support to be provided by the Company under its Guarantee, the Company Collateral and the guarantee to be granted by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan will be subject to, inter alia, the corporate benefit analysis by the board of directors of the Company and will be determined by the directors on the basis of several factors including, inter alia, the financial condition of the Company at the time of the Whitewash Procedure and the availability of distributable profits and/or available reserves as of the date of the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting approving the granting of such Guarantee, the Company Collateral and the guarantee to be granted by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan. As a result, there can be no assurance that the directors of the Company will resolve that the granting of the Guarantee is in the Company’s corporate interest and/or that there will be any distributable profits and/or available reserves and, therefore, that the Guarantee expected to be provided by the Company will actually be granted. See also “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and _Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests—Italy—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantee and Security Interests under Italian Law—Whitewash Procedure.” The_ enforceability of guarantees and/or security granted by virtue of the Whitewash Procedure has not been tested before the Italian courts, and is therefore inherently uncertain. In addition, to the extent losses are recorded by the Company at any time, any such losses could reduce reserves relating to the credit support previously provided by the Company in connection with the Whitewash Procedure; such losses could arise in the ordinary course of business or in connection with contingent liabilities, and it has been held by prevailing legal analysis that losses will only erode any such reserves after full impairment of other reserves and share capital. In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Issue Date and the Company grants its Guarantee, as a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others, financial assistance and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the New Term Loan Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement: (i) the Guarantee and security interests granted by the Company shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the lower of: (A) the amount of distributable profits and available reserves that will be set aside for such purposes by the Company in connection with the Whitewash Procedure; and (B) the principal amount of the Funding Loan outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the Guarantee, in each case net of any proceeds already paid by the Company pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility, the New Term Loan and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by the Company; provided further that the Company shall not be liable as a Guarantor in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that the Company is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by the Company under its Guarantee; 69 ----- (ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by the Company, also in accordance with Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes; (iii) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the Company will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the Company at that time; (iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993), the obligations of the Company under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993, respectively. In any case, the maximum amount that the Company may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the Company Collateral granted by the Company will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by the Company to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the New Term Loan Agreement, Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantee and the security interests granted by the Company, the obligations of the Company as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the New Term Loan Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/ or security obligations of the Company shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the Company’s credit support as described above. In addition to the above, under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by a guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant guarantors’ assets. If such determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the Guarantee and relevant security.

The intercompany receivables arising under the Funding Loan will constitute part of the Issue Date Collateral. Prior to completion of the Post-Completion Merger, repayments of the Funding Loan prior to the maturity date of the Notes would result in a reduction in the liability owed by the Company to the Issuer and any reduction in the principal amount of the Funding Loan would reduce the value of such receivable and the Issue Date Collateral, as well as the value of the Company Collateral and the Company’s Guarantee.

The claims of secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. While the Indenture creates certain obligations to provide additional Guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of granting liens in favor of other indebtedness or the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications pursuant to the agreed security principles. The Agreed Security Principles set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to be granted security or Guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of such agreed security principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets.

Accordingly, such agreed security principles may affect the value of the security or Guarantees provided by the Issuer and any Guarantors. In particular, even though the Notes, the New Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility are expected to share the same security interests and Guarantors’ package, this may not be the case and circumstances may arise in the future in which lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility may be granted the benefit of additional security or guarantees which are not otherwise permitted to be granted in favor of holders of the Notes due to the application of the Agreed Security Principles and, ultimately, applicable financial assistance and corporate benefit rules. Accordingly, in such circumstances, holders of the Notes would have no direct claim for payment against any such additional guarantor nor any rights as a secured party with respect to any such additional collateral. For instance, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur, within 20 Business Days after the first anniversary of the Acquisition Closing Date, the Company will become a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility and, within 120 days after the first anniversary of the Acquisition Closing Date, certain material subsidiaries of the Company will become guarantors thereunder, whereas the Guarantee of the Company in respect of the Notes and the New Term Loan will be granted, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, only to the extent the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Issue Date, as soon as reasonably practicable following the approval of the annual financial statements of the Company for the financial year ending December 31, 2020 and in any event prior to the date falling eighteen months following the Issue Date, provided that this undertaking shall no longer apply following the consummation of the Post-Completion Merger.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Additionally, the Issuer makes no representation that such listing will satisfy the listing requirement under Decree No. 239 in order for the Notes to be eligible to benefit from the exemption from the requirement to apply withholding tax. 75 ----- The Italian tax authorities issued an interpretive circular relating to, among other things, the listing requirement of the aforementioned legislation that may be interpreted to require that the Notes be listed upon their issuance to benefit from the aforementioned provisions, including the exemption from the requirement to apply withholding tax.

In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. As described elsewhere, the extent of the Collateral is limited, including by virtue of the fact that no assets located in an Excluded Jurisdiction will constitute part of the Collateral, the shares of any Material Company incorporated in an Excluded Jurisdiction shall not constitute part of the Collateral, and any such Material Company incorporated in an Excluded Jurisdiction shall not provide any guarantee or security in favor of the Notes. In accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, guarantee and/or security shall only be granted by certain entities. See “Description _of the Notes—Security.”_ Trade receivables, inventories, intellectual property rights, real property and certain other assets of the Issuer, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not constitute part of the Collateral. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges and the amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The shares and other Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of the Collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any direct or indirect transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings similar to (or different from) those that has been required to be obtained in relation to the Acquisition, or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and any Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties are secured by liens, 76 ----- including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to such assets which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. In particular by operation of the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, security interests in the Collateral may be released if a lien is granted on the Collateral in favor of other indebtedness so long as such lien is a Permitted Lien (as defined under “Description of the _Notes—Certain Definitions—Permitted Liens”). Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture,_ holders of such Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.

The granting of the Guarantee and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.","The granting of the Guarantee (and any other future Guarantees which may be required to be granted under the Indenture) and security interests to secure the Notes, the New Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility may create hardening, claw back or voidance periods for such Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions, including Italy. The granting of shared security interests (including security interests in the Collateral), including in connection with any release and retake of such security interest, to secure existing, new or future indebtedness (such as hedging obligations or any additional notes issued under the Indenture) or the transfer or the assignment of the security interest may restart or reopen hardening or claw back periods in certain jurisdictions, including Italy. The applicable hardening, claw back or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected, amended, shared or recreated (as applicable). At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void, ineffective, clawed back and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. Under Italian law, in case any security interests (including security interests in the Collateral) is released and retaken at any time, such release and retaking of security interests may give rise to the start of a new hardening period in respect of such security interests. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, bankruptcy trustees, insolvency administrators or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such security interests. See “Certain Insolvency _Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ The Indenture will provide that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken in several circumstances, including in connection with a public offering of shares of common stock or other common equity interest and certain internal “permitted reorganizations.” In Italy, for example, such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to new hardening periods in respect of the relevant security interests in the Collateral that are granted, perfected or released and retaken, and the security interests in the relevant Collateral would be subject to the same risks described in the preceding paragraph. Similar considerations also apply in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as additional guarantors of the Notes and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable. 77 ----- The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable law. The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore, because the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the security interests in the Collateral will be governed by the laws of a number of different jurisdictions, respective realization and enforcement may be further delayed by court proceedings being taken in multiple jurisdictions.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

As the Notes will be issued by the Issuer, an enforcement over the shares of the Issuer would involve the enforcement over the share pledge of an entity with outstanding debt claims. In addition, the Indenture does not prohibit the Issuer from incurring additional debt claims in the future. Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledge over the Issuer’s shares may result in the release of the Issuer’s debt obligations, which could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to reduce the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge. Therefore, the value of the pledge over the shares of the Issuer may be limited. In addition, the Collateral includes, inter alia, a security interest over the shares of each of the Issuer, the Company and MergerCo, as applicable. To the extent the enforcement of this security interest would result in an acquisition of a holding in the Issuer, the Company or MergerCo, any such enforcement would require clearance by the Italian Government, pursuant to the applicable Italian “golden power” legislation.

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.,"The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken, including Italian law, as applicable. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions (including Italy). In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy, these Parallel Debt provisions would not be applicable provided Italian case law has not ruled for its application. All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under parallel debt structures, the 78 ----- Parallel Debt will typically be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including under Italian law, and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency _Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ For example, in Italy the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holder of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantee by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. Furthermore, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the security documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer under the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). A longer period may apply to any Collateral governed by Italian law which may be granted after the Offering. Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect of the claims of other creditors, even if such claims are secured claims. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity _and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ The enforcement of any Collateral located in Italy or governed by Italian law is subject to mandatory provisions of Italian law, including in relation to limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the terms of the Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements. In case of insolvency of any Guarantors, the enforcement of any collateral provided by such Guarantors may be subject to certain restrictions.

As set forth in “Description of the Notes—Meeting of Holders”, the majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of holders of Notes will be one or more persons holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. These provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of the resolution, to bind all holders of the Notes, including holders of Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and holders of Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an extraordinary resolution may include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption or reduce the redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to change the quorum requirements relating to meetings and/or to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and to change the amendment provisions. These and other changes may adversely impact rights of holders of Notes and may have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions, including Italy, may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantor (or any other future Guarantors which may be required to grant a Guarantee under the Indenture) or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. In particular, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement could be limited in scope and effect by Italian courts to the extent their covenants and provisions, which are untested under Italian case law, could be considered to conflict with mandatory provisions of Italian law. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings or their duration (which may be significantly longer than the duration of analogous proceedings in jurisdictions you may be familiar with). As a consequence, enforcement of rights under the Notes, the Guarantee (and any other future Guarantees which may be required to be granted under the Indenture) and the Collateral in an insolvency situation may be delayed and be complex and costly for creditors. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations _on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ Although laws differ across jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor, the enforceability of any other guarantee of the Notes and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral. In certain circumstances the court may also void the security interest or a guarantee if the relevant company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of a Guarantor or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees and the security interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantees or the security interests provided by such security provider; - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantees or any security interest on the Collateral to the relevant Guarantors or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantors’ or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantees or security interests are found to be a preferences, transactions at an undervalue, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or if otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantors or security provider under its Guarantees or the security interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or security interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantor (or any other future Guarantors which may be required to grant a Guarantee under the Indenture) and security providers under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Guarantees or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance _laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral.”_ 81 ----- In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the security interests created, the Guarantors or security provider: - issued such Guarantees or created such security interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Guarantees or created such security interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantors or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantors or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Guarantees or security interest knew or should have known that the Guarantors or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantees or security interest on the basis that the Guarantees or security interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantors’ or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Guarantees or the creation of the security interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantors’ or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due; - the Guarantees or security interest was entered into within a certain time period prior to the opening date of insolvency proceedings of the Guarantors or collateral provider; or - the amount paid or payable was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantees or created any security interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Although we believe that we and the Group are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantees were issued or the security interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Guarantees was issued or the security interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests granted to secure the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors under the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any claw back action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any claw back action during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the insolvency administrator must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to enforce any claw back action. See “Certain Insolvency Law 82 ----- _Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests”_ for further information. Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions without consideration are ineffective _vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. In_ addition, under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the insolvent entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency. In addition, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the EU. If challenged successfully, the security interest in the Collateral may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents.

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a _società per azioni._ Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, it cannot be excluded that a court may find the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions of the Italian Civil Code to be applicable in respect of the Funding Loan borrowed by the Company. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the Company’s obligations under the Funding Loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should the Company’s obligations under the Funding Loan be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, prior to the PostCompletion Merger the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under the Funding Loan, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee _and the Security Interests.”_ Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans (including the Funding Loan) or notes are subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interest granted by such Italian subsidiaries (including the Guarantee) may be impaired or restricted.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

See “Notice to Investors.” There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited. The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no market. We cannot assure you as to: - the liquidity of any market in the Notes; - your ability to sell your Notes; or - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes. Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including the liquidity of the market for the Notes, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general economic conditions and our own financial condition, performance and prospects, as well as third-party recommendations and any sales into the market by any Initial Purchaser which decides to initially purchase any Notes for its own account. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has from time to time been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of the Notes and may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities. In addition, the trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. The Initial Purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue such market-making at any time without notice. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained, and any disruption in the trading market for the Notes may have a negative effect on your investment regardless of our prospects and financial performance. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at fair value, if at all.

The following table sets forth the consolidated cash and cash equivalents and the capitalization (i) of the Company on a historical basis, as of June 30, 2020 and (ii) of the Issuer as adjusted to give effect to the consummation of the Transactions, as if they had occurred on June 30, 2020. Amounts presented in the table below exclude deferred debt issuance costs. Unless otherwise noted, the adjustments column does not give effect to movements in cash and cash equivalents or amounts borrowed or repaid after June 30, 2020. We believe that presenting the consolidated cash and cash equivalents and capitalization of the Issuer in this manner is the most meaningful way to present the financial position of the Issuer after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on June 30, 2020, given the Issuer is a holding company formed in connection with the Transactions with no revenue generating activities of its own and without any business operations, material assets, other than the shares it holds in the Company and its receivables under the Funding Loan, or material liabilities, other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions, including indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

For purposes of this Offering Memorandum and to enhance comparability of the results of our industry verticals among all the periods under review, we have also presented our results across these six industry verticals for the periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2019. See “Presentation of Financial and Other _Information—Our Industry Verticals and Activities.”_ Our Finance industry vertical comprises services to banks, insurance companies and financial institutions in Italy. Our Health industry vertical comprises services to public and private operators operating in the healthcare sector, including hospitals. Through our Industry & Services industry vertical we serve large and medium-sized corporations in Italy operating in various industries, including the retail, fashion, manufacturing, and process agriculture industries, as well as public and private operators in the transportation sector in Italy. Our Telco & Media industry vertical comprises services to customers in the telecommunications industry as well as media services. Our Energy & Utilities industry vertical comprises services to customers in the energy industry as well as utilities. Lastly, through our Public Administration industry vertical we serve central and local public administration customers. Commencing with the year beginning January 1, 2019, we also started to report our results by the type of activities through which we offer our IT services, software and digital platforms to our customers: Proprietary Solutions, Application Transformation and Managed Services. 94 ----- The activities we conduct in relation to our Proprietary Solutions cover a wide range of industry-specific, innovative vertical software and digital solutions as well as professional services directly related to such software and solutions for which we retain exclusive ownership and which we make available to our customers on the basis of individually negotiated licensing and subscription agreements. The activities we conduct in relation to Application Transformation include the development and customization of advanced digital enabling solutions using cybersecurity, AI, AR, big data analytics and IoT technologies, and we support, maintain and update third party applications and carry out project-based system integration activity in cooperation with our customers and software providers. Our Managed Services comprise activities related to the day-to-day management and operation of the end-to-end infrastructure of our customers.

We deem revenues to be recurring if we expect to generate such revenues in one or more of the following years, either based on specific contractual arrangements or our past experience, such as revenue generated by existing customers seeking new products or services and long-term management or service agreements with customers for whom we have implemented proprietary or customized software solutions. We primarily generate recurring revenues from the activities we conduct in relation to our Proprietary Solutions due to the significant customization of our products and services, which we often develop in close cooperation with our customers, resulting in low churn rate and high levels of contract renewals. Typically, the activities we conduct with respect to our Proprietary Solutions relate to software products and digital solutions for which we retain exclusive ownership and which we make available to our customers on the basis of individually negotiated licensing and subscription agreements. Although the fee structure under these agreements varies slightly across industry verticals, our customers are usually required to pay one off upfront fees for the software license upon installation in addition to a quarterly or yearly fee for customized maintenance services. In line with our strategy to enhance our offering of Proprietary Solutions and increase the share of recurring revenues generated from related activities, we are planning to roll out a full subscription fee model for both the use and maintenance of our licenses to certain of our customers, mainly in our Energy & Utility industry vertical, which we believe will reduce the amount of any one-off upfront payments and increase the amount of recurring payments over the duration of the relevant license contract. The recurring and stable nature of our revenue is supported by long-term contracts and, more generally, by the long-term, strategic relationships we have with some of our key customers. In particular, our top ten customers by revenue in 2019 have been with us for more than ten years, and generated 34% of our revenues in 2019. We believe that the loyalty of our customers is due to their satisfaction with the quality of our products and services, our deep knowledge of complex IT systems and the core processes of our customers and the high costs required to switch IT service providers. In particular, most of our products developed as part of the activities we conduct in relation to Proprietary Solutions, which accounted for approximately 45% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2019, are highly customized and deeply integrated into our end-customers’ IT systems as a result of which their replacement would typically be a complicated, time-consuming and expensive process.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information— _Our Industry Verticals and Activities.” Calculated on the basis of revenues excluding €59.4 million of Group revenues unallocated by_ activity. We typically achieve comparably higher margins from sales generated through the activities relating to our Proprietary Solutions primarily due to the significant customization and the highly specialized nature of our products and services as well as their integration into our end-customers’ IT systems, which enables us to charge our customers for the high added value of such products and services and often results in long-term customer relationships and low churn rates. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated 28% of the revenue related to our Proprietary Solutions in our Finance Industry vertical, 23% of the revenue related to our Proprietary Solutions in our Energy & Utilities industry vertical, 17% of the revenue related to our Proprietary Solutions in our Public Administration industry vertical, 14% of the revenue related to our Proprietary Solutions in our Health industry vertical, 13% of the revenue related to our Proprietary Solutions in our Telco & Media industry vertical and 6% of the revenue related to our Proprietary Solutions in our Industry & Services industry vertical. The margins we achieve from sales generated through the activities relating to Application Transformation, while typically lower than those we achieve from sales generated through activities related to our Proprietary Solutions, are higher than those we generate from the activities we conduct in relation to our Managed Services due to the level of customization that we build into third party applications and client-owned applications as well as the know-how and industry expertise that we utilize to provide the relevant updates to, maintenance of and support for such applications. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated 16% of the revenue related to our Application Transformation in our Finance Industry vertical, 6% of the revenue related to our Application Transformation in our Energy & Utilities industry vertical, 21% of the revenue related to our Application Transformation in our Public Administration industry vertical, 1% of the revenue related to our Application Transformation in our Health industry vertical, 19% of the revenue related to our Application Transformation in our Telco & Media industry vertical and approximately 36% of the revenue related to our Application Transformation in our Industry & Services industry vertical. We typically achieve comparably lower margins from sales generated through the activities relating to our Managed Services, because the Managed Services products we provide, such as day-to-day management and operation of end-to-end processes and infrastructures, are widely available from other IT services providers in our market. However, the profitability of the activities we conduct with respect to our Managed Services is primarily driven by our ability to offer a complete range of products and services to our customers from an integrated platform coupled with our know-how and industry expertise, on the back of long-term contracts. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated approximately 22% of the revenue related to our Managed Services in our Finance Industry vertical, approximately 11% of the revenue related to our Managed Services in our Energy & Utilities industry vertical, approximately 22% of the revenue related to our Managed Services in our Public Administration industry vertical, approximately 1% of the revenue related to our Managed Services in our Health industry vertical, approximately 12% of the revenue related to our Managed Services in our Telco & Media industry vertical and approximately 32% of the revenue related to our Managed Services in our Industry & Services industry vertical. _Sales Mix across Industry Verticals_ Starting from January 1, 2019, we report our results across six industry verticals as follows: (i) Finance, (ii) Health, (iii) Industry & Services, (iv) Telco & Media, (v) Energy & Utilities and (vi) Public Administration, in accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments).

During the periods under review, digitalization increased across all our activities and industry verticals, and was particularly driven by increased and more complex regulation of our customers across several of our industry verticals, and the development and advancement of new technologies such as cloud-based systems, as well as data management, AI and cybersecurity tools and services. In addition, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased demand for digitalization products and services, especially from customers in the public sector, as they have been forced to turn to remote working and cloud-based solutions to run their operations. In recent years, the implementation of several Italian and European governmental and regulatory changes aimed at increasing the use of digital solutions has further increased our customers’ demand for digitalization products and services. Such regulatory changes include: (i) the Italian Revenue Agency’s (Agenzia delle Entrate) introduction of Entratel, mandatory electronic billing and filing software for all businesses operating in Italy, in 2017, (ii) the European Commission’s introduction of GDPR in 2018, which obligates European Union-based companies or companies that process personal data about European Union subjects to comply with various new data protection rules by implementing a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies or types of data, (iii) the introduction of the Family Unit Allowance (Assegni Nucleo Familiare) in 2019, a regulation mandating that all employee benefits be paid electronically, and (iv) the introduction of Nodo Smistamento Ordini in 2019, a regulation mandating that all Italian national healthcare service providers submit their purchase orders electronically.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Accordingly, such figures are not directly comparable and investors should exercise caution when comparing our Adjusted EBITDA among these periods. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” In the Finance industry vertical, demand for our products and services is primarily driven by evolving regulatory standards, such as the implementation of the GDPR, our customers’ increasing focus on the use of digital technologies to redesign and optimize back office processes, higher demand for remote work and surveillance tools, increasing sales digitalization as well as higher demand from customers in the growing fintech industry. We historically generated comparably higher Adjusted EBITDA margins from sales through our Finance industry vertical reflecting the high share of Proprietary Solutions that we offer within the Finance vertical as well as our market leading positions across this industry vertical. In the Health industry vertical, demand for our products and services is primarily driven by the need for customers operating in the healthcare industry to modernize their IT systems and infrastructures, govern data processing and design digital clinical pathways, often leveraging digital enabling technologies as well as data management platforms, as seen in the recent COVID-19 pandemic. We have historically generated comparably higher Adjusted EBITDA margins from sales through our Health industry vertical, reflecting our leading market positions in this industry vertical, the highly regulated nature of the healthcare sector generally, which results in high barriers to entry for new competitors, and the large share of high margin Proprietary Solutions that we offer in this sector. In the Public Administration industry vertical, demand for our products and services is primarily driven by the need for public administration entities to digitalize the relationship between citizens and public authorities and modernize and enhance their IT systems and infrastructures, remote working capabilities, as well as their data analytics capabilities to serve increasing volumes and manage procedures more efficiently, and the increased focus on smart cities and smart mobility. We have historically generated average Adjusted EBITDA margins from sales through our Public Administration industry vertical, as compared to our other industry verticals, reflecting the highly regulated nature of the public sector generally, which results in high barriers to entry for new competitors, and the average share of Proprietary Solutions that we offer in this sector. In the Industry & Services industry vertical, demand for our products and services is primarily driven by higher demand for digital enabling technologies such as IoT and cybersecurity, cloud based services and big data, which are at the center of the so-called Industry 4.0 revolution. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced an increased demand for business continuity, remote work communication tools and tools to secure social distancing and worker health and safety across all sectors in our Industry & Services industry vertical. We believe that customers in our Industry & Services industry vertical, and in particular, customers in the travel, retail and manufacturing sectors, will need to increase their investments in digital enabling technologies in order to safely allow their workforce to return to work as well as to stay competitive in 97 ----- the long term. We historically generated comparably lower Adjusted EBITDA margins from sales through our Industry & Services industry vertical due to the lower share of Proprietary Solutions as compared to the higher share of Managed Services that we offer in this industry vertical. In the Telco & Media industry vertical, demand for our products and services is primarily driven by the digital development that operators in the industry are undergoing in order to protect their existing business and find new revenue streams, trends in the mobile payment business in Italy, increasing demand for remote work and communication tools, the use of IoT capabilities in network infrastructure work as well as the trend in using digitalization for marketing and retention purposes. In the periods under review, revenues from our Telco & Media industry vertical have been driven to a large extent by sales volumes generated from our mobile payment offerings, including Mobile VAS, a platform for in-cloud management services enabling mobile operators to sell value-added products and services to their subscribers. Revenues generated in our Telco & Media industry vertical declined in the year ended December 31, 2019 and in the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to the significant reduction in volumes of mobile payments resulting from restrictions imposed by the competent Italian authorities on the use of services through the Mobile VAS platform by such mobile operators. We historically generated comparably lower Adjusted EBITDA margins from sales through our Telco & Utilities industry vertical due to the significant pricing pressure in this industry vertical as well as our below average share of Proprietary Solutions. In the Energy & Utilities industry vertical, demand for our products and services is primarily driven by smart energy initiatives, which include automation, smart metering and IoT, AR / MR / VR for field services as well as increasing demand for our Net@Suite and Geocall proprietary solutions.

In particular, are currently involved in more than 80 research projects. We invested approximately €27 million in 2019 in R&D, we fund six development labs and maintain over 40 global university partnerships and have strategic alliances with our global research partner ecosystem, which includes universities, research centers, technology companies and end-user companies. We typically capitalize the costs related to the development of a new software or digital platform as an intangible asset and amortize it over the useful life of the product (between three to six years). In addition, we typically capitalize expenses for substantial updates to our existing product portfolio and add them to the original cost of the underlying software or platform. Additionally, we generally expense development costs that improve product performance or that are related to product upgrades as a result of regulatory requirements in the projects that we create for our customers during the period in which they are incurred. Our business is characterized by low levels of recurring capital expenditures in line with the industry in which we operate. Our capital expenditures for the periods under review primarily related to investments in our data centers. We incurred €11.1 million, €11.1 million, €13.1 million and €9.7 million of capital expenditures in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and in the six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, representing 1.1%, 1.0%, 1.0% and 1.6% of our revenues, respectively.

In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and in the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, fixed costs accounted for 60%, 60%, 59% and 62% of our total operating expenses, respectively. Personnel expenses, which represented 54%, 53%, 53% and 54% of our total operating expenses in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and in the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, are the largest part of our cost structure and is largely fixed due to our reliance on our skilled workforce to run our business, other than a small portion relating to variable compensation and travel expenses. Other key fixed costs include rents and leases. The majority of our variable and discretionary costs is represented by costs incurred to pay for external consultants (approximately 3,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019) that we use to manage peaks of demand from customers and which increase the flexibility of our cost structure. We account for these costs as service costs in our income statement. To further support our resilient business model and increase our margins, we launched a number of cost saving initiatives starting from 2017 in order to streamline our operations and achieve annual run-rate cost savings, including management of vendors’ rates, workforce optimization measures such as the near-shoring of approximately 200 full-time (as at December 31, 2019) employees to Serbia, as well as other cost-saving initiatives regarding for example the reduction of travel expenses. To further increase our operational efficiency going forward, we plan to continue focusing on such cost-savings initiatives, with a particular focus on workforce optimization measures, including the continued near-shoring to Serbia of an increasing share of our full-time employees.

While we believe our typical payment terms are consistent with those of our peers, from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we carry significant accounts receivable on our balance sheet from customers that generate a large portion of our revenues. The lengths of payment cycles for services rendered vary across our different industry verticals as well as the type of customer we serve. In particular, our public sector clients typically have longer payment cycles (averaging approximately 280 days) than our private sector clients (averaging about 190 days). Excluding the effect of non-recourse sales of receivables, our average DSOs in trade receivables in the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, was approximately 218, 239, 230 and 251 days, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, our overdue trade receivables from public and private sector customers amounted to €77.4 million (of which €37.2 million were due from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Sicilia) and €110.6 million, respectively. We mainly experience overdue receivables from our public sector customers within our Health and Public Administration industry verticals, which is a common characteristic of commercial relationships between public 100 ----- entities and their private counterparts in Italy. Historically, the level of overdue receivables from customers in our Public Administration industry vertical often comprised 50% or more of the total amount of receivables due from our Public Administration customers. Additionally, customers within our Health industry vertical have the largest proportion of receivables that have been overdue for more than 120 days. Public sector-related customers sometimes follow payment management processes that are subject to review by other government authorities or other entities, which may cause delays or adjustments to their own payment schedules. Overdue receivables from our private sector customers occur primarily within our Industry & Services industry vertical, followed by our Finance, Energy & Utilities and Telco & Media industry verticals and mainly relate to small- to medium-sized enterprises. Delays in payments by our largest customers, requests for modifications to their contractual payment arrangements or defaults on their payment obligations to us could affect our cash flow and results of operations. For example, as of the date of the Offering Memorandum, we are involved, through our controlled subsidiary, SISEV, in two disputes against Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Sicilia for total unpaid amounts of approximately €108 million related to the IT activities connected with the building of an integrated IT platform for Regione Sicilia, within specifications and provisions set out in the convention signed between Regione Sicilia, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and SISEV, which expired on December 22, 2013. As of June 30, 2020, our total exposure to Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Sicilia amounted to €125.2 million, including €110.7 million of trade receivables and €14.5 million of customer contract assets. Our trade receivables from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Sicilia included receivables on invoices issued (€37.2 million), invoices to be issued (€35.4 million) and interest in arrears (€38.1 million). As of June 30, 2020, we recorded a doubtful debt provision in relation to these receivables amounting to €27.4 million and a related doubtful debt provision for interest on arrears amounting to €38.1 million. As of June 30, 2020, our net exposure to Sicilia Digitale and Regione Sicilia amounted to €59.7 million. Except for receivables due from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Sicilia, we believe we have a good track-record of collecting outstanding payments. We mitigate our exposure to the risks relating to the collection of receivables through constant monitoring of our commercial exposure and the collection times of receivables, which we track excluding the effects of non-recourse sales of receivables. We have a dedicated team focused on receivables collection and our sales representatives’ variable bonus includes DSO annual targets. In addition, from time to time in the past, we have engaged in the sale of receivables on the basis of uncommitted framework factoring agreements to manage our working capital during peak periods. Following the completion of the Transactions, we intend to primarily rely on our operating cash flow as well as our Revolving Credit Facility to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity needs.

Historically, we have funded our acquisitions primarily with cash from operations. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, and the six months ended June 30, 2020 we spent €83.7 million, €14.2 million and €31.1 million, and €4.4 million, respectively, as consideration paid for acquisitions of other businesses. We believe our historical acquisition strategy has successfully increased our number of customers and enabled us to expand our business to new market segments and a larger geographic area, while also completing our product and service offerings which we can then offer to our existing and new customers. Through the acquisition of Infogroup in 2017, a company specialized in IT services for the financial industry, we were able to grow our Finance industry vertical and offer Managed Services to our customers in that industry vertical. Our acquisition of Sogeit Solutions S.r.l. in 2017, a company specialized in solutions for the telecommunications, media, energy and utility markets, allowed us to increase our overall volume as well as our share of Proprietary Solutions in our Telco & Media industry vertical. Through our acquisition of Engineering USA, Inc. in 2017, we were able to expand our operations into the United States and acquire capabilities in the product lifecycle management space. In addition, our acquisition of INF.OR. S.r.l. in 2018, a company specialized in application software for local entities, especially in the management of financial resources, enabled us to increase our customer portfolio in the Public Administration industry vertical by supporting municipalities in their digitalization. Our acquisition of Deus Technology in 2019, a fintech company specializing in wealth management, allowed us to expand our offerings within our Finance industry vertical to include wealth management fintech solutions. Moreover, our acquisition of Cybertech Group in 2019, which controls a group of companies specializing in cyber security technology, allowed us to significantly expand our cybersecurity offerings across all six of our industry verticals. In addition, the acquisition of Municipia Mobilità S.r.l., a company specializing in the development of smart mobility solutions, in 2019, enabled us to consolidate our position as one of the leaders in the market of collection and evasion research and recovery services. The acquisition of Digitelematica S.r.l., a software developer that creates solutions for the online ordering from supermarkets and hypermarkets, in 2019, allowed us to expand our web and mobile applications offering to the online retail market. In 2019, we also acquired Cloudesire, a one-stop-shop for service configuration, orchestration, metering, purchasing, billing and provisioning of cloud services. Most recently, with the acquisition of FDL Servizi S.r.l., a company providing software for smart grid-management, in 2020, we further expanded our presence in our Energy & Utilities and Public Administration industry verticals, while increasing the share of Proprietary Solutions. We believe that the acquisitions we made in the periods under review have generated synergies for our business and have contributed to our organic growth. Such acquisitions have given us, for example, the ability to cross-sell the new products and services we acquired to our existing customer base (e.g., Infogroup, Deus Technology, INF.OR and Municipia Mobilità) and to complete our product and service offering. Once the acquired business is fully integrated in our business, we aim to increase its volumes of operations leveraging our integrated platform. In the future, we intend to continue to grow our business, and in particular our Proprietary Solutions portfolio, through disciplined strategic bolt-on acquisitions of specialized IT services providers in order to add complimentary technology and products to our portfolio as well as to enlarge our customer base and expand internationally.

In particular, while our cash collection is stable during the first two quarters of each year on the back of the ongoing fees we receive by customers under all our ongoing contracts, our cash collection usually peaks during the fourth quarter of each year due to the finalization of accounts and payment of invoices by our customers in anticipation of the end of the financial year. Our cash collection is typically lowest during the third quarter of each year due primarily to extended school holidays in Italy during the month of August. Maintenance fees are typically collected quarterly and yearly, starting from when the initial purchase order is made by the relevant customer. Our billing cycle and the recognition of revenues in our income statement is typically subject to similar drivers, with a stable level of revenues recorded in the first two quarters of each year, when we collect purchase orders from customers, and the highest revenues recorded during the third and fourth quarter of each year when we typically issue invoices to our customers in connection with the formalization of purchase orders as binding contracts and the finalization of our yearly accounts. Our working capital levels are also subject to similar drivers, with our working capital levels typically peaking in September of each year, in connection with payments of invoices by our customers, before gradually declining to their low point in December of each year. From time to time, we carry significant accounts receivable balances from a limited number of customers that generate a large portion of our revenues. In the past, we have engaged in the sale of receivables on the basis of uncommitted framework non-recourse factoring agreements in order to support our working capital and liquidity needs. Following the completion of the Transactions, we intend to primarily rely on our operating cash flow as well as our Revolving Credit Facility to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity needs. Billed and unbilled receivables, as well as DSOs in accounts receivable, net of deferred revenue, can vary based on the timing and size of cash receipts. Typically, receivables sold through non-recourse sales of receivables are written off from our financial statements upon their transfer, as all risks and benefits of the factored receivables are irrevocably transferred to the transferee. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we sold €166.6 million of outstanding trade receivables on a non-recourse basis. Our results of operations are also affected by varying billing and invoicing patterns among our different types of activities, industry verticals and types of customers. Sales cycles vary among our different industry verticals and types of customers, with the time between the date a contract is entered into and the beginning of the provision of services ranging from an average of six months for private sector customers to one to two years for contracts awarded under public tenders. Because we recognize revenues only upon the actual provision of the contracted services and achievement of other recognition criteria, the financial benefit of gaining a new client may not be realized at the intended time due to delays in the implementation of our services or due to an increase in the start-up costs required in building our infrastructure.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

As a result, although our revenues have remained resilient through volatile macroeconomic cycles during the past 20 years, with our revenues’ organic growth continuously outperforming Italian GDP growth on a year-over-year basis, macroeconomic conditions, market trends and customer demands in Italy have an impact on our results of operations. Overall economic growth in Italy has been slow since the end of the 2009/2010 financial crisis and the subsequent Eurozone banking crisis, with the Italian GDP growing at a CAGR of 0.9% between 2009 and 2019. Prior to 2015, IT services spend in Italy generally grew in line with GDP growth after which growth in IT services spend increasingly outperformed the Italian GDP growth. See “Industry _and Market Overview—Large and attractive addressable markets.” Between 2017 and 2019, the Italian IT_ Services and Software & Solutions markets grew at a CAGR of approximately 6.3% and were worth approximately €20 billion in 2019, according to Anitec-Assinform. This growth was primarily driven by ongoing digitalization across the Italian public and private sectors, increasing spending in transformation projects from traditional IT to new digital enabling technologies and the “mission-critical” nature of IT services spend, which to some extent insulated the Services and Software & Solutions markets in Italy from macroeconomic fluctuations of GDP growth. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian economy contracted sharply during the first quarter of 2020, recording a year-on-year contraction in GDP of 5.4% and entering a new recession, followed by a 12.8% year-on-year decrease in the second quarter of 2020, which was the worst year-on-year decrease of GDP since records began in 1995 (source: ISTAT) as the country was one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it is at this stage too early to predict the medium- to long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 102 ----- Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets, IT services spend and the Italian economy generally, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic we have experienced an increase in customer demand for digitalization products and services across almost all of our industry verticals, as businesses and public administration entities have been forced to rely on their IT infrastructures and systems and have turned to remote working and cloud-based solutions to run their operations. In the six months ended June 30, 2020, we have seen an increase in revenues across four of our six verticals, particularly in our Health industry vertical, while revenues in our Industry & Services vertical slightly declined due to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on demand from customers in the leisure travel and cruise industry, and revenues in our Telco & Media industry vertical declined as a result of regulatory changes affecting our mobile payments business.

Following the Post-Completion Merger, we will repost our financial results in respect of periods following the Merger Date to holders of the Notes of the level of MergerCo in accordance with IFRS. The Issuer will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS, which will affect the comparability of the Issuer’s future consolidated financial statements with the Financial Statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. We will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Acquisition to our financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Acquisition Closing Date. The application of purchase accounting will result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our balance sheet, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, leasehold rights and software, and different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made. Furthermore, we will incur a substantial amount of indebtedness as a result of the Transactions.

1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.9,Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations,17.9.2,Changes to Accounting Standards,"Our financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. _Adoption of IFRS 16 (Leases)_ On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16, and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. IFRS 16 became effective from January 1, 2019. The new standard replaces the previous lease accounting standard, IAS 17, including related interpretations. We have adopted IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019. On adoption of IFRS 16, we have recognized a financial liability equal to the present value of the outstanding payments at the transition date, discounted using the marginal borrowing rate applicable at the transition date for each lease in relation to leases that had previously been classified as “operating leases” under the principles of IAS 17. We have also recognized a right-of-use asset equal to the amount of the lease liability adjusted for any deferred lease income or lease prepayments recognized in the statement of financial position immediately before the date of initial application. We elected to apply the 103 ----- modified retrospective approach on transition to IFRS 16 and the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard was recognized at the date of initial application, being January 1, 2019. The adoption of IFRS 16 has impacted the following balance sheet line items as of January 1, 2019, compared to December 31, 2018: - non-current assets relating to rights of use of buildings, vehicles, plant and machinery and industrial and commercial equipment increased by €162.0 million, compared to December 31, 2018; and - liabilities increased by €162.0 million, compared to December 31, 2018, of which €148.0 million as non-current lease liabilities and €14.0 million as current lease liabilities. As a consequence of adopting IFRS 16, our Adjusted EBITDA has been positively impacted, reflecting a reduction in operating expenses. As a result, figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 may not be comparable to the corresponding figures presented as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which have not been restated to give effect to IFRS 16. Our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 have not been restated for the application of IFRS 16. Instead, those financial statements applied IAS 17, which was the accounting standard in effect at that time. Therefore, due to the adoption of the new accounting standard and the accounting policies changes applied, the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019 are not directly comparable with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017 and 2018. _Adoption of IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) and IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers)_ On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) (“IFRS 15”) and IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) (“IFRS 9”). IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 were applied using the modified retrospective approach and therefore the retained earnings as of January 1, 2018 have been adjusted to reflect this change for application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15. For more information, refer to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 have not been restated for the application of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9. Instead, this financial statement applied IAS 18 and IAS 39, which were the accounting standards in effect at that time.

This slight decrease was primarily due to the decline in revenues generated in the Telco & Media industry vertical due to a slowdown in mobile payments volumes generated by Mobile Vas, our in-cloud management service platform for mobile operators, in connection with regulatory issues, as further explained below, which more than offset the strong performance in our Finance, Health and Public Administration verticals. Revenues in our Industry & Services vertical slightly decreased due to the impact of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers in the leisure travel and cruise industry. Excluding revenues generated by our mobile payments business, our revenues in the six months ended June 30, 2020, would have been €585.2 million, an increase of €20.8 million (or 3.7%) compared to €564.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. Our organic revenue growth from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020 was flat. _Revenues by Industry Vertical_ The table below shows our revenues by industry vertical for the six month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively:",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

This increase was primarily due to the full year effect of the consolidation into our results of Deus Technology S.r.l., which was not part of our corporate perimeter in the first quarter of 2019, as well as the launch of a major project for Poste Italiane and a new project for UniCredit. Revenues in the Health industry vertical increased by €6.7 million, or 21.1%, from €31.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €38.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to a strong increase in demand for our services as a result to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we played a key role in assisting healthcare authorities in the Veneto region with the implementation of effective measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic by developing Eng-DE4Bios, our datadriven and cloud-native bio-surveillance system that collects, integrates and harmonizes data and utilizes digital enabling technologies to geo-locate infected individuals and identify population clusters that may be at risk. Revenues in the Industry & Services industry vertical slightly decreased by €2.8 million, or 2.1%, from €135.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €132.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. Revenues in the Industry & Services industry slightly decreased mainly due to the decline in demand from our customers in the leisure travel and cruise industry as result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenues in the Telco & Media industry vertical decreased by €15.6 million, or 19.4%, from €80.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €65.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to an anticipated decline in the mobile payments business as a result of the significant reduction in volumes generated on Mobile VAS, a platform for in-cloud management services enabling mobile operators to sell value-added products and services to customers with subscriptions, resulting from restrictions imposed by the competent Italian authorities on the use of services through the Mobile VAS platform by such mobile operators. In particular, revenue generated from our mobile payments business decreased from €27.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. Excluding revenues generated by our mobile payments business, revenues in our Telco & Media industry vertical in the six months ended June 30, 2020, would have been €58.7 million, an increase of €5.5 million (or 10.3%) compared to €53.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. Revenues in the Energy & Utilities industry vertical slightly increased by €0.6 million, or 0.6%, from €95.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €95.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This slight increase was primarily due to a new contract with ENEL and the consolidation of FDL Servizi, acquired in February 2020. Revenues in the Public Administration industry vertical increased by €6.7 million, or 5.4%, from €123.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €129.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to revenues generated by the new framework agreement with CONSIP for the provision of digital services to local municipalities and regional administrations, which was awarded to us in 2019, as well as the continuous implementation of other framework agreements won in the past months. _Other Revenues_ Other revenues increased by €0.5 million, or 3.6%, from €13.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €14.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial rebates from our partners and suppliers. _Raw materials and consumables_ Cost of raw materials and consumables increased by €11.8 million, or 103.5%, from €11.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €23.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase of €11.3 million in the cost associated with the resale of software products. Cost of raw materials and consumables accounted for 1.9% of our revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared with 3.9% of our revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2020. _Service costs_ Service costs decreased by €14.9 million, or 7.5%, from €199.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €184.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a €7.3 million decrease in travel expenses primarily resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic, as well as a €6.0 million decrease 107 ----- in costs for external professional resources used in our operating and production cycles mainly resulting from the reduction in the services offered by content providers in relation to mobile payment contracts. Service costs accounted for 33.8% of our revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared with 31.3% of our revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2020. _Personnel costs_ Personnel costs increased by €6.5 million, or 2.0%, from €323.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €330.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to a €5.7 million increase in other personnel costs from €7.4 million to €13.1 million, resulting from a reclassification of €2.4 million relating to cars assigned to employees as required under IFRS 16 from “amortization and depreciation” to “other personnel costs”, and a €5.3 million increase in costs relating to the existing stock option plan, which together offset a €0.5 million decrease in costs for salaries and wages, resulting from the use of government subsidies for the salaries of employees furloughed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and voluntary salary reductions implemented by certain executives. Personnel costs accounted for 54.7% of our revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared with 55.8% of our revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2020. _Amortization and depreciation_ Amortization and depreciation decreased by €0.3 million, or 1.0%, from €30.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €30.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the €0.4 million decrease in amortization of tangible assets, which was partly offset by a €0.2 million increase in amortization relating to the implementation of IFRS 16. Amortization and depreciation costs accounted for 5.2% of our revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared with 5.1% of our revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2020. _Provisions_ Provisions decreased by €17.2 million, or 80.4%, from €21.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €4.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily resulting from a €16.3 million decrease in the allocation to doubtful debt provisions due to a provision of doubtful receivables by, and a write-down of receivables due from, the Group’s controlled subsidiary, SISEV. See “Business—Legal _Proceedings.” Provisions accounted for 3.6% of our revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared_ to 0.7% of our revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2020. _Other costs_ Other costs decreased by €0.9 million, or 14.3%, from €6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €5.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in non-income tax and social contribution charges. Other costs accounted for 1.1% of our revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared to 0.9% of our revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2020. _Financial income_ Financial income decreased by €0.2 million, or 5.6%, from €3.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a €0.9 million decrease in positive foreign exchange differences, which offset a €0.7 million increase in interest income related to receivables from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A and Regione Sicilia relating to unpaid invoices. See “Business—Legal _Proceedings.” Financial expenses_ Financial expenses increased by €3.8 million, or 86.4%, from €4.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €8.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in negative foreign exchange difference. _Income taxes_ Income taxes increased by €0.3 million, or 6.7%, from €4.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €4.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our 108 ----- income before tax, which led to an increase in corporate income tax payable, which was partly offset by an increase in deferred tax assets and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities. The difference between the increase in our income before tax and the increase in our income taxes was due to the accrual of a bad debt reserve of €16.5 million in 2019, which is neutral from a tax standpoint being deductible when it will be utilized. The accrual of a bad debt reserve in 2019 did not impact income taxes in the six months 2020 because there has been no reversal in the profit and loss statement or use of risk provision. _Adjusted EBITDA_ Adjusted EBITDA increased by €3.1 million, or 4.5%, from €69.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €72.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the significant increase in sales volumes and an increase in research and development costs in our Health industry vertical, which were capitalized during the period under review, as well as the increase in sales volumes and the contribution of FDL Servizi S.r.l. in our Energy & Utilities industry vertical, which more than offset the decrease in sales volumes in both our Telco & Media and Public Administration industry verticals due to the decline in our mobile payments and tax collection businesses, respectively. Excluding Adjusted EBITDA generated by our mobile payments business, our Adjusted EBITDA in the six months ended June 30, 2020, would have been €72.0 million, an increase of €4.6 million (or 6.8%) compared to €67.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. _Adjusted EBITDA by industry verticals_ The table below shows our Adjusted EBITDA by industry vertical for the six month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively:",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

This increase was primarily due to the contribution of Deus Technology S.r.l. as well as cost savings achieved due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as lower travel expenses and lower service costs related to external professional resources services. Adjusted EBITDA in the Health industry vertical increased by €1.9 million, or 50.0%, from €3.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €5.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to increased sales volumes, cost savings, mainly in relation to travel expenses, as a result of the Italy-wide quarantine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the capitalization of costs relating to research and development, which increased by €1.4 million in the first six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA in the Industry & Services industry vertical increased by €1.3 million, or 14.1%, from €9.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €10.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the recovery in productivity levels of Engineering do Brasil and OverIT and, to a lesser extent, the contribution of Digitelematica S.r.l. and cost savings realized in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted EBITDA in the Telco & Media industry vertical decreased by €1.2 million, or 18.8%, from €6.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €5.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the slowdown in revenues generated from our mobile payments business as compared to other solutions offered in our Telco & Media industry vertical, which declined from €27.4 million in 109 ----- the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €6.3 million in the first six months ended June 30, 2020.

Excluding Adjusted EBITDA generated by our mobile payments business, Adjusted EBITDA in our Telco & Media industry vertical in the six months ended June 30, 2020, would have been €5.0 million, an increase of €0.3 million (or 6.4%) compared to €4.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA in the Energy & Utilities industry vertical increased by €1.2 million, or 11.5%, from €10.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €11.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to increased sales volumes and the contribution of FDL Servizi S.r.l. Adjusted EBITDA in the Public Administration industry vertical decreased by €0.5 million, or 4.1%, from €12.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €11.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the significant decrease in volumes generated by our tax collection business (Municipia S.p.A.) due to the decision by the Italian Government to postpone all income tax collections in connection with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic which did not result in a corresponding decrease in operating costs and was not compensated by the increase in volumes generated from other sources.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of services and products across almost all our six industry verticals and, in particular, in our Finance and Telco & Media industry verticals, resulting from the further expansion of digital enabling technologies projects, as well as the full consolidation into our results of new companies acquired, in particular Cybertech Group and 110 ----- Deus Technology S.r.l, which more than offset the decrease in revenues generated in the Telco & Media industry vertical due to the anticipated slowdown in our mobile payments business. Excluding revenues generated by our mobile payments business, our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019, would have been €1,205.4 million, an increase of €110.9 million (or 10.1%) compared to €1,094.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Our organic revenue growth from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019 was 5.6%. _Revenues by Industry Vertical_ The table below shows our revenues by industry vertical for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively:",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Our Industry Verticals and Activities.” Revenues in the Finance industry vertical increased by €34.9 million, or 14.6%, from €239.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €274.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to increased sales generated with key clients and resulting from the increased focus on innovative technologies to support banks such as the e-payment business as well as the consolidation into our results of Deus Technology S.r.l. in the fourth quarter of the year. Revenues in the Health industry vertical increased by €6.5 million, or 10.2%, from €63.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €70.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to new contracts won (including with Regione Lombardia, Tuscany region and Abruzzo region). Revenues in the Industry & Services industry vertical increased by €27.2 million, or 10.8%, from €253.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €280.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to new projects launched with FCA as well as the impact of the full consolidation into our results of Cybertech Group starting from the fourth quarter of the year. Revenues in the Telco & Media industry vertical decreased by €21.5 million, or 11.8%, from €181.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €160.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the slowdown of the mobile payment business as a result of a reduction in volumes generated on Mobile VAS, a platform for in-cloud management services enabling mobile operators to sell valueadded products and services to customers with subscriptions, resulting from restrictions imposed by the competent Italian authorities on the use of services through the Mobile VAS platform by such mobile operators. In particular, revenue generated from our mobile payments business decreased from €60.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €45.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding revenues generated by our mobile payments business, revenues in our Telco & Media industry vertical in the year ended December 31, 2019, would have been €114.5 million, a decrease of €6.6 million (or 5.5%) compared to €121.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenues in the Energy & Utilities industry vertical increased by €14.7 million, or 8.0%, from €183.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €198.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of our proprietary solution Net@Suite. Revenues in the Public Administration industry vertical increased by €34.0 million, or 14.6%, from €233.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €267.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to revenues generated by a new framework agreement with CONSIP for the provision of digital services to local municipalities and regional administrations as well as the strong performance in our tax collection business by our subsidiary Municipia S.p.A., as a result of new contracts awarded by municipalities. 111 ----- _Other Revenues_ Other revenues decreased by €2.3 million from €25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to a higher amount of grants awarded for research projects financed by national and European institutions. _Raw materials and consumables_ Cost of raw materials and consumables increased by €13.6 million, or 67.5%, from €20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase of €12.1 million in costs associated with the resale of software products from €13.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to €25.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Cost of raw materials and consumables accounted for 1.7% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2.7% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. _Service costs_ Service costs increased by €3.4 million, or 0.8%, from €421.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €425.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to (i) a €11.8 million increase in costs for external professional resources services used in our operating and production cycles resulting from higher revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019, (ii) €1.2 million of charges for external professional services received by the Group in relation to the due diligence activity performed in connection with the Acquisition and (iii) €1.6 million costs for the transfer of the Group’s headquarters which, together, more than offset a €13.9 million decrease in expenses related to building, hardware and software rentals due to the impact of the implementation of IFRS 16. Service costs accounted for 36.5% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with 34.0% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. _Personnel costs_ Personnel costs increased by €50.9 million, or 8.6%, from €589.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €639.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was due to an increase in the average number of employees for the Group, due to both organic growth and the entry of new companies into the scope of consolidation, which resulted in increased costs of €33.6 million for salaries and wages for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in personnel costs was also due to increased social security expenses. Personnel costs accounted for 50.8% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with 51.2% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 0.4 percentage points. _Amortization and depreciation_ Amortization and depreciation increased by €16.8 million, or 38.7%, from €43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €60.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the adoption of the new IFRS 16 standard which provides for the depreciation of the right of use, specifically buildings, plant and machinery, industrial and commercial equipment. This effect amounted to €20 million. Amortization and depreciation accounted for 3.8% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with 4.8% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. _Provisions_ Provisions increased by €23.7 million, or 150%, from €15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increased allocation to doubtful debt provisions due to a provision of doubtful receivables by, and a write-down of receivables due from, the Group’s controlled subsidiary, SISEV. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” The difference also relates to releases for amounts set aside in previous years which were settled with the related collection of receivables from SISEV. Provisions accounted for 1.4% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with 3.2% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. _Other costs_ Other costs increased by €2.1 million, or 17.5%, from €12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to as a result of fines incurred in connection with a reassessment of past income taxes (€2.7 million) as well as unrecoverable 112 ----- withholding taxes paid in certain countries of operation outside of Italy (€0.2 million). Other costs accounted for 1.0% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with 1.1% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. _Financial income_ Financial income decreased by €7.2 million, or 46.1%, from €15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income related to receivables from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A and Regione Sicilia relating to unpaid invoices and a decrease in gains on foreign exchange differences. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” _Financial expenses_ Financial expenses decreased by €1.1 million, or 9.0%, from €12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in losses on foreign exchange differences which more than offset the increase in interest expenses on certain loans. _Income taxes_ Income taxes decreased by €5.9 million, or 24.4%, from €24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower overall taxable income resulting in a decrease of corporate income tax by €2.6 million and a change in deferred tax assets and liabilities of €3.3 million. _Adjusted EBITDA_ Adjusted EBITDA increased by €32.8 million, or 22.3%, from €147.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €180.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the first-time application of IFRS 16 (€20.3 million) on all our industry verticals, except the Energy & Utilities industry vertical, as well as increase in sales volumes across almost all of our industry verticals, which more than offset the decrease in revenues in the Telco & Media industry vertical due to the anticipated slowdown in our mobile payments business. Excluding the effect of IFRS 16, Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been €159.7 million, an increase of €12.5 million (or 8.5%) from €147.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, excluding Adjusted EBITDA generated by our mobile payments business, our Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2019, would have been €176.6 million, an increase of €32.9 million (or 22.9%) compared to €143.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. _Adjusted EBITDA by industry verticals_ The table below shows our Adjusted EBITDA by industry vertical for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively:",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Our Industry Verticals and Activities.”  2019 figures reflect the first-time application of IFRS 16, whereas 2018 figures reflect our Adjusted EBITDA prior to the implementation of IFRS 16. Accordingly, investors should exercise caution when comparing data from the 2018 and the 2019 columns of this table. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” (a) For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, please see “Summary Historical and Certain Other Financial Data—Other Financial Information and As Adjusted Data.” 113 ----- Adjusted EBITDA in the Finance industry vertical increased by €11.0 million, or 22.1%, from €49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the first-time application of IFRS 16 (approximately €6.8 million) as well as the combination of organic growth and the impact of the consolidation of Deus Technology. Excluding the effect of IFRS 16, Adjusted EBITDA in our Finance industry vertical for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been €54.0 million, an increase of €4.2 million (or 8.4%) from €49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA in the Health industry vertical increased by €1.8 million, or 16.6%, from €10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the first-time application of IFRS 16 (approximately €1.4 million). Excluding the effect of IFRS 16, Adjusted EBITDA in our Health industry vertical for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been €11.2 million, an increase of €0.4 million (or 3.7%) from €10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA in the Industry & Services industry vertical increased by €5.6 million, or 31.2%, from €17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the first-time application of IFRS 16 (approximately €2.6 million) as well as to a strong performance in our operations in the United States. Excluding the effect of IFRS 16, Adjusted EBITDA in our Industry & Services industry vertical for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been €20.9 million, an increase of €3.0 million (or 16.8%) from €17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA in the Telco & Media industry vertical increased by €3.5 million, or 21.5%, from €16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the first-time application of IFRS 16 (approximately €5.5 million). Excluding the impact IFRS 16, Adjusted EBITDA in the Telco & Media industry vertical would have been €14.3 million, a decrease of €2.0 million (or 20%) from €16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was mainly due to the anticipated slowdown in our mobile payments business. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generated from our mobile payments business decreased from €3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding Adjusted EBITDA generated by our mobile payments business, Adjusted EBITDA in our Telco & Media industry vertical in the year ended December 31, 2019, would have been €16.4 million, an increase of €3.6 million (or 28.1%) compared to €12.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA in the Energy & Utilities industry vertical increased by €1.4 million, or 4.8%, from €27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the good results generated by Net@Suite. The first-time implementation of IFRS 16 had no impact on the Adjusted EBITDA of the Energy & Utilities industry vertical. Adjusted EBITDA in the Public Administration industry vertical increased by €9.7 million, or 38.2%, from €25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the first-time application of IFRS 16 (approximately €4.0 million) as well as to the strong performance by our subsidiary Municipia S.p.A.

This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of services and products in particular in our Finance, Telco & Media and Energy & Utilities industry verticals due to primarily new contracts awarded by public sectors customers, growth in the offering of integrated products for the manufacturing sector as well as strong results in mobile payments and key contract wins in Italy and Brazil, and the full consolidation into our results of new companies acquired, in particular Infogroup and Sogeit.

See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Our Industry Verticals and Activities.” 115 ----- Revenues in the Finance industry vertical increased by €81.5 million, or 51.5%, from €158.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €239.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the full consolidation into our results of Infogroup, which accounted for approximately €75.0 million of revenues in 2018, as well as increased sales with key clients resulting from the increased focus on innovative technologies to support banks. Revenues in the Health industry vertical increased by €5.5 million, or 9.3%, from €58.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €63.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the launch of a new project within the Veneto region and new contracts won (including hospitals in Viterbo and Rome). Revenues in the Industry & Services industry vertical increased by €18.6 million, or 7.9 %, from €234.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €253.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to growth in our key clients and the full consolidation of entities acquired in 2017, mainly Engineering USA (previously known as Hyla Soft). Revenues in the Telco & Media industry vertical increased by €25.9 million, or 16.7%, from €155.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €181.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to strong sales from the mobile payments business and the consolidation into our results of Sogeit, which was acquired in 2017. Revenues in the Energy & Utilities industry vertical increased by 22.4 million, or 13.9%, from €160.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €183.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to key contract wins in Italy and Brazil and the consolidation into our results of Sogeit, which was acquired in 2017. Revenues in the Public Administration industry vertical decreased by €0.7 million, or 0.3%, from €234.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €233.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the lower number of successful auctions at the central public administration level during the year which was partially offset by a stronger performance at the local public administration level driven primarily by the new framework agreements awarded by CONSIP for the provision of integrated management systems (SGI) on the entire Italian territory as well as new contracts relating to regional accounting systems with regions (including Lazio, Puglia and Piedmont). _Other Revenues_ Other revenues decreased by €1.6 million or 5.9% from €27 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a lower amount of grants awarded for research projects financed by national and European institutions. _Raw materials and consumables_ Cost of raw materials and consumables increased by €3.8 million, or 23.4%, from €16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase of €3.3 million in costs associated with the resale of software products from €10.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to €13.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost of raw materials and consumables accounted for 1.6% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 1.7% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Service costs_ Service costs increased by €54.3 million, or 14.8%, from €367.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €421.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a €40 million increase in costs for external professional resources services used in our operating and production cycles resulting from higher revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018. Service costs accounted for 36.7% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 36.5% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Personnel costs_ Personnel costs increased by €67.6 million, or 13.0%, from €518.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €586.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was due to an increase in the 116 ----- average number of employees for the Group, due to both organic growth and the entry of new companies into the scope of consolidation, which resulted in increased costs of €55.1 million for salaries and wages for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in personnel costs was also due to increased social security expenses. Personnel costs accounted for 51.8% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 50.8% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Amortization and depreciation_ Amortization and depreciation increased by €9.5 million, or 27.9%, from €34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the €8.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets resulting from the capitalization of costs associated with the development of software products as intangible assets as well as an increase of industrial patents and intellectual property following the purchase price allocation in connection with acquisitions. Amortization and depreciation accounted for 3.4% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 3.8% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Provisions_ Provisions decreased by €3.3 million, or 17.8%, from €19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a decreased allocation to doubtful debt provisions in relation to interest in arrears attributable to receivables from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A and Regione Sicilia relating to unpaid invoices. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” Provisions accounted for 1.9% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 1.4% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Other costs_ Other costs decreased by €0.7 million, or 5.3%, from €12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in costs for gifts and donations and in non-income tax charges. Other costs accounted for 1.3% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 1.0% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Financial income_ Financial income increased by €5.3 million, or 51.5%, from €10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in interest income related to receivables from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Sicilia relating to unpaid invoices (see “Business—Legal Proceedings”) and (ii) the change in the contractual terms of one of the Group’s bank facilities due to the implementation of IFRS 9 which resulted in the recognition of other income of €3.1 million as financial income. Financial income accounted for 1.0% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 1.3% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Financial expenses_ Financial expenses decreased by €3.8 million, or 27%, from €15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in interest expenses on certain loans. Financial expenses accounted for 1.6% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with 1.0% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Income taxes_ Income taxes increased by €19.2 million, or 400%, from €4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our taxable income which resulted in an increase in foreign corporate income taxes of €1.3 million as well as the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities. _Adjusted EBITDA_ Adjusted EBITDA increased by €24.3 million, or 19.8%, from €122.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €147.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

This increase was primarily due to a strong performance in our product manufacturing lifecycle management and automation sub-segments, as well as the full consolidation of businesses acquired during 2017, mainly Engineering USA (previously known as Hyla Soft). Adjusted EBITDA in the Telco & Media industry vertical decreased by €1.7 million, or 9.9%, from €18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

This increase was primarily due to the positive performance of Net@Suite. Adjusted EBITDA in the Public Administration industry vertical increased by €3.2 million, or 14.4%, from €22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.38,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.38.1,Overview,"Historically, the principal sources of our liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities and bank credit lines. In addition, in the past, we have engaged in the sale of receivables on the basis of uncommitted framework non-recourse factoring agreements in order to support our working capital and liquidity needs. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we sold €166.6 million of outstanding trade receivables on a non-recourse basis. See “—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.” Following the completion of the Transactions, we intend to primarily rely on our operating cash flow as well as our Revolving Credit Facility to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity needs. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility _Agreement.” In addition, following the Issue Date, we expect to enter into the BPM Facility, which will provide_ for term loans in an aggregate principal amount €15.0 million. See “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Rolled Company Indebtedness—BPM Facility.”_ Historically, our principal uses of cash have been, and we expect that our principal uses of cash following the Transactions will be, to fund capital expenditures, provide working capital, meet debt service requirements, fund our add-on acquisitions, including funding the payment of earn outs and the exercise of certain put and call 118 ----- options related to our acquired subsidiaries that have minority shareholders. We believe that the current cash flow from operating activities and existing bank financing will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet current working capital needs. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience a reduction in revenue collection from customers in some of the most affected industries, such as the leisure travel and cruise industry, and a corresponding increase in bad debt and cancellation, which may negatively impact our liquidity position. However, we believe that the diversified nature of our activities across our six industry verticals, coupled with our current liquidity position, available amounts for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility as well as borrowings under certain bilateral and other credit lines that we expect will remain outstanding following the completion of the Transactions, will mitigate the potential risk that could arise from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the six months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded positive cash flow generation and revenue collection levels. In addition, while we continue to closely monitor the evolution of the pandemic and any effects it may have on the Group’s financial condition and liquidity position, we believe that our current sources of liquidity and cash levels will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures, provide working capital, and meet our debt service requirements following the Transactions. See “Summary—Recent Developments—COVID-19 Update,” “Risk Factors—Risks _Related to Our Business and Industry—Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and results of operations” and “Industry and Market Overview—Preliminary considerations on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets.”_",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Net Working Capital is not a measure of net income, operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with IFRS. When assessing our operating performance, you should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income, operating income or any other operating performance or liquidity measure that is calculated in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of _Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures.”_ Change in Net Working Capital represents the difference in Net Working Capital as of the specified date compared to Net Working Capital as of the comparable prior date. Our Net Working Capital results are affected by seasonality, with our Net Working Capital levels typically peaking in September of each year, reflecting our revenue generation pattern, before gradually declining to their low point in December of each year. Trade receivables are initially recognized at transaction price, adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (i.e., the rate that equalizes the current value of expected cash flows and the carrying amount at the time of initial recognition), suitably adjusted to take account of any write-downs, by recording a doubtful debt provision. Trade receivables 120 ----- are included in current assets, with the exception of those falling due more than twelve months after the reporting date, which are classified as non-current assets. At each reporting date, financial assets, with the exception of those measured at fair value with a contra-entry recognized in the income statement, are analyzed to assess the existence of any possible impairment indicators. IFRS 9 requires the application of a model based on expected losses on receivables. We apply the simplified approach to estimate expected losses along the receivable useful life and take into account its historical experience of losses on receivables, adjusted to reflect current conditions and estimates of future economic conditions. For trade receivables recorded at amortized cost, when an impairment has been identified, the relevant value is measured as the difference between the asset book value and the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. This value is recognized in the income statement. Receivables sold under our uncommitted framework non-recourse factoring agreements, pursuant to which the final transfer to the transferee is carried out in relation to risks and benefits of factored receivables, are derecognized from the financial statements upon their transfer. See also “—Off-Balance _Sheet Arrangements.”_ Deferred contract costs represent only costs considered ‘incremental’ and recoverable through the economic benefits of the contract, in accordance with IFRS 15. Costs that cannot be classified as ‘incremental’, such as costs incurred independently and not related to the acquisition of the contract, are expensed in the income statement. We mitigate our exposure to the risks relating to the collection of receivables through constant monitoring of our commercial exposure and the collection times of receivables, which we track excluding the effect of non-recourse sales of receivables. For example, we have a dedicated team focused on receivables collection and our sales representatives’ variable bonus includes DSO annual targets. See “Quantitative and Qualitative _Disclosures Regarding Market and Financial Risks—Credit Risk.” Excluding the effect of non-recourse sales of_ receivables, our DSOs in trade receivables decreased from 251 days in the year ended December 31, 2017 to 230 days in the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of our more focused approach to collecting outstanding invoices starting in 2018. Excluding the effect of non-recourse sales of receivables, our DSOs in trade receivables slightly increased to 239 days during the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting an increase in public sector clients, which typically have longer payment cycles than our private sector clients.

See “Presentation of Financial and Other _Information.”_ Unaudited. _Total cash flow from / (used in) operating activities_ Total cash flow from / used in operating activities changed by €60.3 million, or 279.2%, from an outflow of €21.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to an inflow of €38.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This change was primarily due to positive net working capital movements for the six months ended June 30, 2020, as a result of our increased focus on cash collection and improvement in DSOs following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The six months ended June 30, 2019 recorded an increase in working capital versus the year ended December 31, 2018, while working capital in the six months ended June 30, 2020 was substantially in line with the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in total cash flow from / used in operating activities was also driven by an increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily as a result of an increase in sales volumes. Total cash flow from operating activities decreased by €6.1 million, or 6.6%, from an inflow €92.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an inflow of €86.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash flow from operating activities declined despite an increase in Adjusted EBITDA as a result of an increase in net working capital mostly driven by an increase in volumes in our Public Administration industry vertical where our public sector clients typically have longer payment cycles when compared to our private sector clients. 119 ----- Total cash flow from operating activities increased by €3.9 million, or 4.1%, from an inflow of €88.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to an inflow of €92.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This change was primarily due to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA as a result of the impact of the full consolidation of Infogroup into our results as well as the positive performance in our Finance and Energy & Utilities industry verticals as well as management’s increased focus on timely cash collection, through cash collection incentive plans. Our cash flow from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 also benefitted from favorable payment terms of Infogroup’s main clients, which are financial institutions. _Total cash flow from / (used in) investing activities_ Total cash flow used in investing activities increased by €1.1 million, or 8.7%, from an outflow €12.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to an outflow of €13.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase in outflow was primarily due to an increase in purchases of tangible assets. Total cash flow used in investing activities increased by €18.7 million, or 74.5%, from an outflow of €25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an outflow of €43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in outflow was primarily due to an increase of purchases of investments in subsidiaries combined with a marginal increase in our capex spending, approximately €2.0 million increase. Total cash flow used in investing activities decreased by €68.2 million, or 73.1%, from an outflow of €93.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to an outflow of €25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease in outflow was primarily due to a decrease of purchases of investments in subsidiaries, while our capex remained constant in absolute terms In the year ended December 31, 2017, we closed the acquisition of Infogroup at the end of December, which resulted in the full purchase price coming due at that time. Infogroup was the largest acquisition that we completed in the year ended December 31, 2017. _Total cash flow from / (used in) financing activities_ Total cash flow used in financing activities increased by €30.3 million, or 178.9%, from an outflow of €17.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to an outflow of €47.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase in outflow was primarily due to an increase in the taking out and repayment of financial loans. Total cash flow used in financing activities decreased by €68.4 million, or 70.9%, from an outflow of €96.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an outflow of €28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in outflow was primarily due to a decrease in the repayment of borrowings. Total cash flow used in financing activities decreased by €3.5 million, or 3.5%, from an outflow of €100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to an outflow of €96.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

We did not experience any slowdown in our ability to collect cash from our customers in the six months ended June 30, 2020. Net working capital increased by €15.0 million, or 5.2%, from €290.2 million as of December 31, 2018 to €305.2 million as of December 31, 2019, which resulted from an increase in customer contract assets and trade receivables as of December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the growth in our revenues as of December 31, 2019 as well as to the impact of the four acquisitions completed during the year, which together more than offset the write down of trade receivables from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A and Regione Sicilia completed during the year ended December 31, 2019, and the increase in trade payables as of December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018.

To mitigate credit risk related to commercial counterparties we have put in place procedures aimed at ensuring that product sales are made to customers who are deemed reliable due to, for example, their high creditworthiness. Credit risk is further mitigated through constant monitoring of our commercial exposure and the collection times of receivables. For example, we have a dedicated internal team focused on receivables collection; our sales representatives’ variable bonus includes DSO annual targets in order to fully align the corporate structure with such targets. We believe our credit risk mitigation techniques are effective. Our clients include leading players in their reference market sectors. As such, we believe that there is limited risk that such operators will face insolvency, bankruptcy or other administrative procedures. Any financial assets that we consider of doubtful recoverability are appropriately allocated to the bad debt provisions. As of June 30, 2020 we recorded allowances for bad debts with respect to receivables from customers of €54.1 million. As of December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we recorded allowances for bad debts with respect to receivables from customers (including SISEV) of €46.4 million, €39.3 million and €54.4 million, respectively.

Prudent management of the liquidity risk arising from normal operations requires the maintenance of an adequate level of cash and the availability of funds obtainable through an adequate amount of credit lines. We further mitigate liquidity risk by ensuring that we have access to different sources of financing, with different banking institutions and that there are no significant concentrations of liquidity risk on the side of both financial assets and the sources of financing. To further mitigate any liquidity risk, we have implemented a cash pooling approach within the Group.

The Group recognizes revenue when it fulfills the underlying contractual performance obligations, or when it transfers control of the goods or services to the customer, depending on the nature of the services provided and the type of contract. In particular, in the context of (a) annual and multi-year projects under deliverable-based contracts (approximately 47% of revenues), revenues are recognized over a period of time based on the percentage of costs accrued or the period underlying progress of the service provided; (b) consulting services provided under resource-based contracts (approximately 124 ----- 10% of revenues), revenues are recognized based on the number of working days and the price list established in the contract; (c) the provision of services tied to the occurrence of specific events under service-based contracts (approximately 23% of revenues), revenues are recognized at a point in time upon the occurrence of certain events underlying the supply of the Group’s services; and (d) assistance and maintenance services provided under assistance and maintenance-based contracts (approximately 20% of revenues), revenues are recognized periodically on the basis of the provisions included in the relevant contract. For more information, see note 4.22 of our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. _Other revenues_ Other revenues mainly refer to revenue from grants for research projects financed by national bodies and by the European Union. as well as “other income” which comprises revenues of various types, including re-invoicing of fringe benefits to employees for corporate SIM cards for mobile telephones. Grants are recognized when there is reasonable certainty that they will be received and that the conditions required for obtaining them are met. When grants relate to cost components, they are recorded as revenues, and systematically allocated to different periods to offset the costs to which they relate. When the grants relate to an asset, for example plant, they are recorded in the income statement under revenues rather than as an adjusted item of the book value of the asset for which it was obtained. Subsequently, the useful life of the asset for which the grant was obtained is taken into account using the deferral technique. Public grants obtained as compensation of expenses and costs already incurred or with the intention to provide immediate financial aid to the entity without which there would be future costs, are recorded as income in the year in which they become payable.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725
1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.51,Accounting,17.51.2,Critical accounting policies,"The preparation of financial statements requires our management to apply accounting principles and methods which, in certain circumstances, are based on difficult and subjective assessments and estimates based on historical experience and assumptions that are considered reasonable from time to time and realistic according to the relative circumstances. The application of these estimates and assumptions affects the amounts reported in the financial statements and other information provided in this Offering Memorandum. The final results of the financial statement items for which the aforementioned estimates and assumptions have been used may differ from those reported in the financial statements due to the uncertainty that characterizes the assumptions and conditions on which the estimates are based. The areas that require more subjectivity on the part of management in preparing the estimates, and for which a change in the conditions underlying the assumptions used could have a significant impact on the financial data, are briefly described below. _Impairment of assets_ In accordance with IFRS, the Group assesses whether the goodwill has suffered impairment each year, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. The recoverable amount of the cash generating units has been calculated based on calculations of the value in use. These calculations require the use of estimates. _Purchase Price Allocation (IFRS 3)._ The recognition of business combination transactions implies the allocation of the payment of acquisition to the assets and liabilities of the acquired company, which are evaluated at fair value. The possible difference, if positive, is recorded as goodwill; if negative, it is recorded in the income statement. In the process of assigning amounts to certain asset items, the Group applied estimates to determine their fair value. To determine fair value, the Group used valuation methods, including discounted cash flow analysis. To calculate the present value of future cash flows, it is necessary to formulate some assumptions regarding uncertain issues, including management’s expectations regarding: - Marginality of customer portfolios; - The probability of renewal of contracts with customers; and - The selection of the discount rate that reflects the risk. The Group’s estimates are based on assumptions deemed reasonable, but uncertain and foreseeable. These assessments require the use of management assumptions, which may not reflect unpredictable events. 125 ----- _Deferred tax assets_ The recoverability of deferred tax assets is subject to the achievement of sufficiently large future taxable profits for the absorption of the aforementioned tax losses or to the competition of the deferred taxation connected to the other deferred tax assets. Significant management judgments are required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized in the financial statements based on the timing and amount of future taxable income. In particular, it should be noted that deferred tax assets have been recorded on past tax losses for the portion estimated recoverable against future taxable income shown in the updated strategic plans of the Group, also as a consequence of the fact that the tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely. _Fair value of options on non-controlling interest_ The fair value of liabilities, which represents a reasonable estimate of the exercise price for the options, was determined using the discounted operating cash flow method using the plan of the subsidiary involved. The exercise prices are determined on the basis of the agreements contained in the option agreements signed by the Group. 126 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

We focus on the Application Software segment, with a suite of vertical focused industry solutions and horizontal software solutions catering to the Italian enterprise market. In the period between 2017 and 2019, the Application Software segment grew at a faster pace than the others, with the Middleware and System Software remaining flat. The following chart sets forth a breakdown of the Italian Software & Solutions market by segment for the period between 2017 and 2019. €m Source: Anitec-Assinform 2020. **CAGR ‘17-’19** 10.3%** Application Softwares 0.8%** Middleware Softwares (1.2%)** System Softwares |Col1|7,694|Col3| |---|---|---| |7,136 6,626 5,410 4,892 1,216 1,221 518 505|5,954|| ||1,235|| ||506|| 2017A 2018A 2019A The growth in the overall Application Software segment has been driven by the increasing demand for IoT solutions, which grew by more than 18.7% between 2017 and 2019, due to the increased penetration of such technology across different industries. In particular, IoT solutions are used in smart manufacturing, as part of various services offered to citizens (including with respect to environment, health, safety, transport and smart cities), as well as in an increasing number of industries related to the production of goods and services (such as agri-food, smart retail, tourism, construction and energy). Web platforms have also contributed significantly to the growth of the Application Software segment (growing by 13.5% between 2017 and 2019), due to the increasingly central role of digital channels for sales and marketing activities. The trend of horizontal and vertical software solutions has remained stable due to the continuously sustained demand for migration to cloud services. Cloud SaaS represents a widely used technology, especially for non-core applications and the adoption of SaaS technology for core platforms is increasing. In addition to economic and financial advantages, customers are attracted to Cloud SaaS technologies to benefit from the improved speed of implementation, the possibility of upgrading solutions, scalability and improved allocation of capital and operating costs. The market for ERP software has been stable in the last few years (with operators primarily focusing on maintaining and upgrading existing platforms), while new investments are aimed at integrating new modules aimed at managing processes that are not adequately covered today. Initiatives aimed at replacing ERP platforms are guided by the need to standardize processes and reduce levels of complexity. AI technology is being applied in CRM software, as it allows marketing divisions to better identify potential customers and engage them by leveraging on relevant tailored information through any available communication channel. At the same time, the introduction of virtual assistants and chatbots is increasing the efficiency and productivity of customer service activities. AI is also being applied in SCM (Supply Chain Management), where the most innovative supply chain players already use machine learning, among others, to predict the demand from different customer segments, or to assign daily tasks. 137 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Cybersecurity, IoT and Mobile Business are the most developed segments within this market and continue to have a significant impact on investment plans and budgets of companies across all industries. In addition, cloud technology has strengthened its role as key driver to modernization of IT architectures in companies of any size across all sectors. The Cloud Computing segment continued to grow with a record increase of 23% in 2019 compared to the previous year, reaching a total size of €2.8 billion in terms of revenue. Excluding relatively small private cloud components, the cloud market in 2019 was mainly comprised of IaaS services and SaaS platforms, representing 53.1% and 41.5% of the market, respectively, which demonstrates the growing adoption of such technologies in the context of core business applications, and not only for single productivity applications. The crucial role of cloud solutions as an enabling driver of the digital transformation is demonstrated by the results of a survey carried out in 2018 by Anitec-Assinform among the CIOs of the top 100 Italian companies, which showed that 83.3% of the participants to the survey considered the cloud as the infrastructure platform application of choice for the adoption of digitalization solutions. According to the same survey, 48% of the CIOs had on their agenda IoT related projects. The Italian IoT market in 2019 was worth €3.5 billion in terms of revenues, increasing by 18.3% compared to the previous year. Major IoT investments include predictive industrial maintenance and asset management, traceability through the supply chain and logistics management.

Within the Digital Enablers market, the cybersecurity segment grew by 13.0% to €1.1 billion in 2019 compared to the previous year. All components of this segment demonstrated significant growth in 2019 compared to the previous year: Security Managed Services and Cloud Security grew by 14.7% to €444.4 million, 138 ----- Other Cyber Security Services (which includes System Integration, Security & Risk Assessment and Penetration Test services, and training of human resources) grew by 10.5% to €423.2 million, Software Solutions grew by 12.9% to €126.3 million, Hardware grew by 15.4% to €80.0 million, and Consulting grew by 15.6% to €62.6 million. In 2019, the big data solutions segment was worth €1.1 billion, recording a growth of 16.1% compared to the previous year. In 2018, than 80% of this segment is represented by the adoption of both on-site and cloud software solutions, including database, tools for acquiring, processing, visualizing and conducting data analysis, and applications for specific business processes, as well as related services, including consulting, integration, development and implementation services. The remaining approximately 20% of the big data solutions segment is attributable to spending on hardware systems, especially for storage and networking devices. The main applications of such technologies focus on two areas:(i) the creation of customer data platforms that support customer analytics and profiling activities for targeted campaigns and (ii) the collection and analysis of data from machinery (industrial companies), water networks and distribution of gas and electricity, in order to carry out predictive maintenance activities and optimize network management. In the near future, the implementation of machine learning algorithms is expected to allow the transition from a predictive analysis of events to a prescriptive one, in which the real value, extrapolated from the data, will automatically trigger actions, with even more tangible advantages. The significant expansion of the AI segment in Italy, which grew by 59.3% to €215 million in 2019, compared to the previous year, is mainly driven by a widespread use of AI solutions in large companies, with a high level of pervasiveness at sectoral and functional levels. AI applications currently include voicebot and chatbot systems, voice recognition and natural language understanding and processing solutions that optimize customer services by directly interacting with customers through the recognition of human language. Other applications of such disruptive technology include biometric applications, image recognition and video analysis technologies; machine and deep learning algorithms allow the creation of artificial neural networks, giving machines the ability to learn in automatic and function similarly to a human brain, without being specifically programmed to do so.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Anitec-Assinform in their updated 2020 report expects the market to decrease in 2020, but to recover strongly in 2021. A preliminary visible effect is that businesses have been strongly incentivized, as a result of the lockdown and social distancing measures adopted by the Italian government, to invest in their technology infrastructure and offerings. This trend supported our strong performance during the first few months of 2020 (see “Summary—Recent Developments—Recent Trading.”) and is expected to create lasting opportunities for IT Services players as the public and private sectors are expected to accelerate digitalization. IT players that are able to proactively support customers in adapting to the “new normal” by expanding their digital transformation offerings are expected to be able to navigate the economic turmoil. We believe the increasing complexity and mission critical nature of IT Services, coupled with the increased reliance on IT Services providers for digitalization solutions to be implemented across the various business units and divisions within businesses and other organizations, has reduced the overall exposure of the IT Services and Software & Solutions markets to economic cycles and downturns.

We offer our IT services, software and digital platforms and solutions to our customers by engaging in three distinct types of activities: (i) Proprietary Solutions, (ii) Application Transformation and (iii) Managed Services. In particular: - **Proprietary Solutions: We offer a wide range of cutting-edge software and digital solutions (including AI, cloud-based services, IoT, AR / MR / VR, digital twin and blockchain platforms) and related services primarily to customers in our Finance, Energy & Utilities, Public Administration, Telco & Media and Health verticals. Our Proprietary Solutions relate to four main software suites, and a longer tail of approximately 25 smaller products, all developed in-house and owned by us. Our Proprietary Solutions comprise end-to-end service partnerships with certain of our customers through which we provide tailored digital service packages which also include Application Transformation services and Managed Services. We estimate that, in 2019, we were one of the leading providers of governance, risk and compliance reporting software for financial institutions, field service management solutions, CRM solutions and billing platforms for utilities providers and healthcare ERP solutions for hospitals in Italy based on revenue. Excluding €59.4 million of total revenues unallocated by type of activity, we generated 45% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019 from our activities related to Proprietary Solutions. - **Application Transformation: We develop and customize state-of-the-art IT services, software and digital solutions such as cloud migration, cybersecurity, ERP evolution, SAP HANA migrations, AI and advanced analytics. We are a leading service provider and system integrator in Italy, customizing and developing third-party digital-enabled IT solutions for providers such as SAP, Microsoft, Salesforce and Oracle, and advanced digital enabling capabilities (e.g., cybersecurity, AI and AR / MR / VR) together with our partners, including Tibco, Google and AWS. We also run third-party applications (providing updates, maintenance and support) as part of our Application Transformation activities. We generated 43% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019 from our activities related to Application Transformation. - **Managed Services: Our Managed Services comprise the day-to-day management and operation of end-to-end processes and infrastructures through innovative IT solutions, such as hybrid, multi-cloud 145 ----- based services, robotic process automation, next generation service desks with chatbots and digital agents, as well as various digital workplace solutions. We generated 12% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019 from our activities related to Managed Services. We are present in all regions and most metropolitan cities in Italy (including Milan, Rome and Turin) and operate across several sectors of the economy, including public administration, financial services, utilities, telecommunications, transportation, infrastructure and healthcare. In particular, we operate each of our activity types across six industry verticals, which correspond to our reporting segments under IFRS 8 (Operating _Segments) and represent the verticals or strategic markets in which we operate, with industry-specific knowledge_ supported technologies and competences. Our six industry verticals are Finance, Health, Industry & Services, Telco & Media, Energy & Utilities and Public Administration.

Our customers include more than 1,700 large private and blue chip companies and public sector bodies, among which are six of the largest Italian banks (including Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit, Banco BPM and UBI Banca), major telecommunications companies (including Vodafone and Telecom Italia (“TIM”)), utilities companies (including Enel and Eni), manufacturing companies (including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (“FCA”)), healthcare organizations (including the Veneto Healthcare System and the majority of hospitals in Italy) and transportation and infrastructure companies (including Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane). In 2019 we worked on approximately 16,600 individual IT services, software and digital solutions contracts which were distributed amongst our customers. We seek to create long-term, strategic relationships with our customers, and aim to be viewed as an integral part of their businesses. We have historically been able to achieve long-lasting, integral customer relationships by creating significantly customized and highly specialized products and services that we integrate into our end-customers’ IT systems. Our average relationship tenure with customers is approximately ten years. Our business benefits from low customer concentration and significant customer diversification across all of our industry verticals, with no customer accounting for more than 8% of our revenue and no industry vertical accounting for more than 22% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2019. In the same period, our top ten customers generated 34% of our revenue. We believe our success and leading position in the Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets is largely dependent on our strong focus on R&D, and we invested approximately €27 million in R&D in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our R&D activities rely on a dedicated team of researchers and data scientists. Our R&D Lab works closely with other units of the company, which include an Innovators Network, Development Labs, internal Competence Centers and Products Labs. We believe our business model has allowed us to quickly respond to and continue to efficiently operate our business during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, during the Italy-wide lockdown in March, April and May 2020, we were able to continue to ensure business continuity and service our clients while safeguarding the health and safety of our employees. We successfully transitioned substantially all of our employees to remote working over a short period of time, maintaining high levels of service and assisting our clients with their responses to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, including in connection with digital transformation projects, digital workplace solutions, cybersecurity, cloud-based solutions and business continuity solutions that have all seen increased demand as a result of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and that we expect will continue to see increased demand going forward. As of today, we have an average of 6,800 employees per day working remotely.

1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,212,BUSINESS,212.3,Our Strengths,212.3.1,Leading player in the attractive Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets with strong growth driven by digital transformation secular trend,"The Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets grew at a CAGR of approximately 6.3% between 2017 and 2019, significantly outperforming overall Italian GDP growth, which grew at a CAGR of 1.1% over the same period, and were worth approximately €20 billion in 2019. In addition, the Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets are forecast to grow at a CAGR of 7.3% between 2020 and 2022 mainly driven by (i) increasing penetration of the Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets, (ii) digitalization across all private and public clients, and increasing spending in transformation projects from traditional IT to new digital enabling technologies and (iii) increasingly mission critical nature of IT services spending. The Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets have historically been, and remain, underpenetrated compared to the equivalent markets in other European countries, and in the year ended December 31, 2019, IT services spend in Italy as a percentage of GDP amounted to 0.7% compared to the European average of 1.1%, according to management estimates, which we believe provides us with opportunities for significant further growth. The increasing penetration of IT services in Italy is expected to accelerate as the Italian government and regulators implement policies that favor digitalization through IT investments, such as the Industry 4.0 plan and the National Plan for Innovation 2025, and as Italian companies increase their spending on IT services to accelerate their competitive advantage and keep pace with the global trench towards digitalization. We believe that growth in the Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets is mainly driven by strong ongoing digitalization across the Italian public and private sectors, with increased IT services spending on and diversified growth of new digital enabling technologies, such as (i) IoT (which is expected to grow by approximately 12% between 2020 and 2022), (ii) cloud and IaaS services (which are expected to grow by approximately 18% between 2020 and 2022), (iii) big data (which is expected to grow by approximately 13% between 2020 and 2022), (iv) cyber security (which is expected to grow by approximately 11% between 2020 and 2022) and (v) AI (which is expected to grow by approximately 27% between 2020 and 2022), according to Anitec-Assinform. See “Industry and Market Overview.” Additionally, growth in IT services spend is also driven by the increasingly mission-critical nature of IT services in business operations which we expect to result in IT services spend in Italy becoming more resilient in the face of future market downturns and less correlated to macroeconomic trends. Additionally, we are seeing an increasing focus on cost efficiency and specialization of IT services, which is leading companies to rely on external providers rather than developing IT in-house. We believe that our size and expertise in complex software, solutions and IT services compared to some of our smaller competitors and competitors focusing on less complex products and services, position us well to benefit from such trends, which we expect to be confirmed in the mid- to long term and that digitalization will increase and accelerate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

As a result, we believe that these barriers favor local players, thus allowing us to capitalize on our leading positioning in the market for both traditional technologies and digital enabling technologies in Italy, given our deep knowledge of the domestic market and long-lasting relationships with a wide cross-section of Italian customers and partners. Italian customers have also been shown to prefer software and IT services suppliers with whom they share a common language, that have extensive operations in Italy and that have an in-depth know-how of the applicable Italian legal and regulatory framework, which we believe makes entering the Italian IT Services and Software & Solutions markets more 147 ----- challenging for international players.

The vast majority of revenues generated from our activities related to Proprietary Solutions comes from the sale of software- and product-related services following the initial sale of the software license. Our Proprietary Solutions portfolio enables us to benefit from strong competitive positions in specific niches, particularly within the Finance, Energy & Utilities, Public Administration, Industry & Services and Health verticals. Our proprietary software solutions portfolio includes four software suite and 27 smaller products, including (i) Grace, the leading compliance and risk management software program developed for financial institutions, servicing most major banks in Italy, with a market share estimated to be double that of its closest competitor, (ii) AREAS, one of the largest digital platforms for the digitalization and integration of clinical and administrative healthcare processes in the hospital ERP markets and the second largest in the Italian healthcare IT market, (iii) Geocall, the leading field service management solution by OverIT, (OverIT has been named by Gartner as a “Visionary” in Gartner’s April 2019 Magic Quadrant for Field Service Management), (iv) Net@Suite, the leading cloud-based platform for billing and CRM for all types of sales and distribution operators in the gas and electricity markets, and (v) JEnte, one of the leading software programs for the digitalization of processes of Italian municipalities. Our Proprietary Solutions portfolio targets specific niches across all of our industry verticals that are highly attractive in light of their regulated nature, the need for highly tailored solutions and the elevated costs that customers must bear for switching providers. Furthermore, we believe that the strong reputation of our Proprietary Solutions also allows us to up-sell and cross-sell our Managed Services and Application Transformation services. We supplement our strong software offering across all of our activity types with new and advanced digital enabling capabilities, including AI and advanced analytics, cloud-based services, cybersecurity, IoT, robotic process automation, AR / MR / VR, digital twin and blockchain platforms, and in the year ended December 31, 2019 approximately 54% of our revenue-generating projects incorporated digital enabling technologies, mainly driven by digital transformation projects and advanced proprietary solutions.

We continuously invest in R&D and innovation to support the ongoing improvement of our organization in increasing our competitive capacity and fulfilling the needs of a fluid, rapidly changing market. Our investment in R&D to develop and maintain our research and project management activities has amounted to approximately €27 million, in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our R&D operations are led by a dedicated team of researchers and data scientists. Our R&D Lab works closely with other units of the company, which include an Innovators Network, comprising over 200 innovation experts, Development Labs, internal Competence Centers and Products Labs. We partner with more than 40 universities globally and have 22 strategic alliances with our global research partner ecosystem, which includes universities, research centers, technology companies and end-user companies. We believe we are among the most active research companies in Europe, attracting funds from national and EU research programs, ranking first among European companies in volume of security-related research projects funded by the EC, according to Anitec-Assinform. We ranked among the top 15 European companies in terms of participation in, and amount of research funding awarded under, the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Programme for Research and Innovation, according to the Publications Office of the European Union. As a result, we are widely recognized as a leader in ICT research and innovation in Europe. In the six months ended June 30, 2020, we received €9.7 million in research funding from Italian and European research programs. We also deploy a significant amount of resources for the training of our technology engineers, core process specialists and digital scientists who support our entire production cycle.

In particular, the revenues we generate from our activities related to Proprietary Solutions, which accounted for approximately 45% of total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019, are highly recurring and demonstrate our long-lasting relationships with our Proprietary Solutions customers primarily as a result of the local, highly specialized and customized nature of our Proprietary Solutions as well as their integration into our end-customers’ IT systems, which also limits competition for our products and services in respect of those customers. In addition, the revenues we generate from our activities related to Managed Services relating to the day-to-day management and operation services of our own infrastructure and data centers and provide to customers individually and in connection with our Proprietary Solutions are secured by long-term contracts. Our Managed Services customers display high retention rates also due to the difficulty of switching to a different provider.

These PUE scores indicate good energy sustainability performance according to industry consortium The Green Grid. In addition, Pont-Saint-Martin data center is undergoing optimizations to its cooling system that we estimate will allow it to lower its PUE score to 1.45 by the end of 2020, contrary to an industry trend which has seen an increase of PUE scores from a worldwide average of 1.58 in 2018 to 1.67 in 2019, according to a leading industry consultancy.

As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, we are involved, through our subsidiary, SISEV, in two disputes against Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. (“Sicilia Digitale”) and Regione Siciliana for unpaid amounts of approximately €108 million for both proceedings. In particular, in 2016, in the context of a claim to obtain payment of approximately €80 million of unpaid invoices, Regione Siciliana and Sicilia Digitale filed a counterclaim against us alleging a breach of contract and claiming damages for an amount of €96 million. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum this litigation is still ongoing. Following an order by the competent court, we settled a previous litigation against Sicilia Digitale for unpaid invoices in an amount of approximately €20 million (of which €13 million were awarded to us and the remainder to a co-contractor) as compared to an original amount claimed of approximately €30 million. An appeal is currently pending with respect to such litigation and the next hearing is scheduled on February 5, 2021.

The hearing for the decision on the measures of enquiry (mezzi istruttori) and the closing arguments has been scheduled for November 9, 2021. We have not made any provisions to cover any settlement or unfavorable judgment in this matter. - **_Pradac proceeding. We are involved in a dispute with a supplier, Pradac, for an amount of approximately €12 million for claims of abuse of a position of economic dependence. On January 8, 2020, the Court of Rome rejected all of Pradac’s claims. While as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Pradac has not yet appealed the Court of Rome’s judgment, the deadline to file an appeal has not expired. We have not made any provisions to cover any settlement or unfavorable judgment in this matter given the Court of Rome’s decision against Pradac.

Subject to certain exceptions set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Issuer may not, and the Issuer shall procure that no restricted subsidiary will, repay, prepay, purchase, defease or redeem (or otherwise retire for value) any Notes prior to their scheduled repayment date. The exceptions to such covenant include (among other things) note purchases that do not exceed 50% of the aggregate of (i) the original aggregate principal face value amount of the Notes and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes as at the Closing Date or (without double counting) when initially incurred at any time after the Closing Date (the “Notes Purchase Basket”) or to the extent the aggregate principal face value amount of all note purchases exceeds the Notes Purchase Basket an amount of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility are cancelled or prepaid in the same proportion by which the Notes in excess of the Notes Purchase Basket are prepaid, purchased, defeased or redeemed (or otherwise retired for value), until the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility are reduced to €80,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency or currencies).

The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio is calculated as the ratio of consolidated drawn loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, less the aggregate amount of cash, cash equivalents and temporary cash investments held by the Group (the “Drawn Super Senior Facilities Debt”) to consolidated pro forma EBITDA for the twelve month period preceding the relevant quarterly testing date and is tested quarterly on a rolling basis, subject to the aggregate outstanding principal base currency amount of all loans drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations by way of letters of credit (or bank guarantees), ancillary facilities, any loans drawn on the Closing Date, any loans drawn to fund any original issue discount, other flex related payments or other fees, costs and expenses and, in each case, any Rollover Loans in respect of any such exclusions), less any cash, cash equivalents and temporary cash investments held by the Group exceeding 40% of the total commitments in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility (or, if higher, the total commitments in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility as at the date of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) on the relevant test date. The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio only acts as a draw stop to new drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility and, if breached, will not trigger a default or an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio is based on the definitions and adjustments in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the Indenture and the equivalent definitions described in this Offering Memorandum. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the shareholders of the Issuer to make shareholder injections by way of debt and/or equity to the Issuer to be (i) added to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (an “EBITDA Cure”), (ii) taken into account when calculating Drawn Super Senior Facilities Debt or (iii) taken into account when calculating if the Test Condition (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) has been met. The EBITDA Cure right may not be exercised on more than five occasions during the term of the Revolving Credit Facility and may not be exercised more than twice in any four (4) consecutive financial quarters. If the financial covenant has been breached but is complied with on the next test date or other relevant period prior to the next test date (the “Second Test Date) or the Test Condition (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) is not satisfied on the Second Test Date, then any prior draw stop event arising as a result shall be automatically deemed cured.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

All of the liabilities of the Subsidiaries of the Company, including obligations to trade creditors and creditors holding claims under debt and guarantees issued by such Subsidiaries, will rank structurally senior to the Notes. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the Company accounted for 72% of the revenue and 64% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the Group, in each case, before intercompany eliminations. As of June 30, 2020, the Company accounted for 91% of the total assets of the Group, excluding intercompany eliminations. None of the subsidiaries of the Company is expected to guarantee the Notes. In addition, as of June 30, 2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Subsidiaries of the Issuer would have had €7.9 million of Indebtedness outstanding, and there would have been €160.0 million available for drawing by the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility, assuming the Revolving Credit Facility remains undrawn as of the Issue Date. Furthermore, (x) on or about the Issue Date, the Issuer expects to enter into the New Term Loan and (y) following the Issue Date, the Company expects to enter into the BPM Facility which will provide for terms loans in an aggregate principal amount of €15.0 million. For a description of the Indebtedness and other financing arrangements of the Group that are expected to remain outstanding, committed and/or available on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, see “Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements.”_ 207 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes and the New Term Loan. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. 209 ----- The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which include, among others: - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalization,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity _impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval_ requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security will be limited accordingly;

- the determination that the time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs and all applicable legal fees) related to granting the relevant guarantee and/or security (including in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/ or registration) will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security; - the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant charger to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof; provided that reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group prior to the date of the security or accession document that the asset is material and the Issuer is satisfied that such endeavors will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy; - the agreement that members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group, provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

A Notes Guarantee (if any) will be subject to certain contractual and legal limitations, as described under “—Notes Guarantees” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and _Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.” In particular, the Notes Guarantee which, subject to_ the Agreed Security Principles and certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, is expected to be provided by the Company as soon as reasonably practicable following the approval of the annual financial statements of the Company for the financial year ending December 31, 2020 and in any event prior to the date falling eighteen months following the Issue Date if the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within the first anniversary of the Issue Date, will not in any event exceed at any time an amount equal to the lower of (i) the amount of distributable profits and available reserves that will be set aside for such purposes by the Company in connection with the Whitewash Procedure; and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the Funding Loan outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the Notes Guarantee, in each case net of any proceeds already paid by the Company pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by the Company; provided further that the Company shall not be liable as a Guarantor in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that the Company is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by the Company under its Notes Guarantee. By virtue of these limitations, the Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or the Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the _Guarantee and the Security Interests—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests—Italy—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and Security Interests Under Italian Law.” In addition, the Note Guarantee may be released under certain_ circumstances. See “—Notes Guarantees Release.” The Company will (x) guarantee our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement on or prior to the date on which the Company provides its Notes Guarantee and (y) use commercially reasonable efforts to guarantee the New Term Loan on the same date as, and on a pari passu basis with, the Notes, in each case, to the extent applicable. In particular, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Acquisition Closing Date, the Company is expected to provide a guarantee in respect of its obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement within thirty Business Days from the first anniversary of the Acquisition Closing Date, whereas the Company will only be required to provide its Notes Guarantee and the guarantee of the New Term Loan within the date falling eighteen months following the Issue Date. Prior to the Post-Completion Merger and, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve 211 ----- months from the Issue Date, prior to the granting of the Guarantee by the Company, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including the Company). In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur, and after the granting of the Notes Guarantee by the Company (and subject to any limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Company. After the Post-Completion Merger, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of MergerCo.

All of the liabilities of the Subsidiaries of the Company, including obligations to trade creditors and creditors holding claims under debt and guarantees issued by the Group companies (other than the Company), will rank structurally senior to the Notes. If granted, the Notes Guarantee of the Company will be subject to certain material limitations. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the _Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests.”_ Although the Indenture restricts the Incurrence of Indebtedness by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in excess of the limitations described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

We intend to use commercially reasonable efforts to merge the Issuer with the Company in the PostCompletion Merger, with the resulting entity being MergerCo. Following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes. Concurrently with the Post-Completion Merger, the Security Interests over the Issuer’s receivables in respect of the Funding Loan will be automatically terminated and (a) in the event that the Issuer is the successor company of the Post-Completion Merger, the security interest over the share capital of the Company will be extinguished by operation of law or (b) in the event that the Company is the successor company of the Post-Completion Merger, the security interest over the share capital of the Issuer will be extinguished by operation of law. To the extent applicable, certain Security Interests granted in favor of the Notes will be re granted or re confirmed (to the extent necessary) in accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” following the PostCompletion Merger.

All of the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations (if any) as well as the New Term Loan.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral may also secure certain future Indebtedness on the same basis as the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations (if any) with respect to the receipt of proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after all such “super senior” obligations have been satisfied may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders. In addition, the lender under the New Term Loan will contractually be entitled to receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes, which may further reduce the amount of enforcement proceeds that will be available to the Holders.

Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts and unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer or successor Person, as applicable, will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that the relevant Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of: (1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note is made, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax, by or on behalf of any Payor or the Paying Agent;

provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of: (1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax 222 ----- purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Notes Guarantee; or (2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor or any other person through whom payment can be made addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction is payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

or (7) any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (or, in each case, any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable), any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or any law implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or (8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above. In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly. The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable efforts to obtain and provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request, and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. The Payor will attach to each such certified copy or other evidence of such payments a certificate stating that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy or other evidence was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding.

The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The Payor will pay and reimburse the Holders for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Notes after this offering and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (7)).

1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.19,Change of Control,21.19.1,,"If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “—Change _of Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000_ or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Notes of €100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase Notes as described under this heading “—Change of Control,” in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived. Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; 224 ----- (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly, at the cost of the Issuer, mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxembourger Wort) or to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require the Issuer to make a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the New Term Loan Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility or the New Term Loan and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreements may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer 225 ----- or the Restricted Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources and whether the Restricted Subsidiaries are permitted to distribute funds to the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security _Interests—The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender” and “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Capital Structure—The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and prior to the Post-Completion Merger will depend exclusively on cash from the operating companies of the Group to be able to make payments on the Notes.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (i) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder (which may only be waived with the consent of Holders holding 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the Indenture)) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee and, if requested, the Trustee has received, customary indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; 254 ----- (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of such indemnity and/or security; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60 day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee is aware, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to customary indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against all losses, liabilities and expenses (including legal fees) caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed under “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such provision or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (“144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the 144A BookEntry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons who have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons who hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. Book-Entry Interests will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit a participant’s account on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes under the Indenture for any purpose. So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its respective nominee) will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the owner who made the initial request. In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law. 295 ----- To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar, and any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes. We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of fifteen calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date fixed for redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. We are also not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer or asset sale offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture. We may require a holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the Notes. If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Trustee or the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We, the Registrar and/or the Trustee may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Each of the Issue Date Collateral, the PostMerger Collateral and the Company Collateral is further described under “—Security.” The Collateral will also secure the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations (if any) and the New Term Loan on a pari passu basis. In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur within twelve months from the Acquisition Closing Date, the Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be secured by the Company Collateral within 30 Business Days from the date falling twelve months after the Acquisition Closing Date, whereas the Company Collateral will only be required to be granted in relation to the Notes and the New Term Loan within twenty Business Days following the issuance by the Company of its Notes Guarantee. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), and subject to applicable laws, in the event of an enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will be treated as pari passu among each other and on a pari passu basis with the lender under the New Term Loan, although they will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full. In addition, subject to applicable laws, the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances.

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, payments of Interest relating to Notes issued by the Issuer that qualify as _obbligazioni or titoli similari alle obbligazioni are subject to a tax, referred to as imposta sostitutiva (as defined_ below), levied at the rate of 26% (either when Interest is paid or when payment thereof is obtained by the holder on a sale of the Notes) where an Italian resident holder of Notes is the beneficial owner of such Notes, and is: (a) an individual holding Notes otherwise than in connection with entrepreneurial activity, unless he has entrusted the management of his financial assets, including the Notes, to an authorized intermediary 300 ----- and has opted for the application of the so-called risparmio gestito regime (the “Asset Management Option”) pursuant to Article 7 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997, as amended (“Decree No. 461”); or (b) a partnership (other than a società in nome collettivo or società in accomandita semplice or similar partnership) or a de facto partnership not carrying out commercial activities or professional associations; or (c) a private or public entity (other than a company) or a trust not carrying out commercial activities; or (d) an investor exempt from Italian corporate income tax. All the above categories are classed as “net recipients.” Where the resident holders of the Notes described in (a) and (c) above are engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax and may be deducted from the income tax due. Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian resident individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decrees No. 509/1994 and No. 103/1996 may be exempt from any income taxation, including the _imposta sostitutiva, on Interest if the Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth under Italian tax law._ Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the 26% imposta sostitutiva is applied by banks, società di intermediazione _mobiliare (“SIMs”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del risparmio, stockbrokers and other qualified_ entities, identified by a decree of the Ministry of Finance, which are resident in Italy (“Intermediaries” and each an “Intermediary”) or by permanent establishments in Italy of banks or intermediaries resident outside Italy or by organizations or companies non-resident in Italy, acting through a system of centralized administration of securities and directly connected with the Department of Revenue of the Ministry of Finance (which includes Euroclear and Clearstream) having appointed an Italian representative for the purposes of Decree No. 239. For the purposes of applying imposta sostitutiva, Intermediaries or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries are required to act in connection with the collection of Interest or, in the transfer of Notes. For the purpose of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act, either with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in a change in the Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited. Payments of Interest in respect of the Notes issued by the Issuer that fall within the definitions set out above are not subject to the 26% imposta sostitutiva if made to beneficial owners who are: (a) Italian resident corporation or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected; (b) Italian resident partnerships carrying out commercial activities (società in nome collettivo or società in _accomandita semplice);_ (c) Italian resident open-ended or closed-ended collective investment funds, investment companies with fixed capital (SICAFs) or investment companies with variable capital (SICAVs) established in Italy; (d) Italian resident pension funds referred to in Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005 (“Decree No. 252”) and Italian resident real estate investment funds; and (e) Italian resident individuals holding the Notes in connection with an entrepreneurial activity or Italian resident individuals who have entrusted the management of their financial assets, including the Notes, to an authorized financial intermediary and have opted for the Asset Management Option. Such categories are classed as “gross recipients.” To ensure payment of Interest in respect of the Notes without the application of the 26% imposta sostitutiva, gross recipients must: (a) be the beneficial owners of payments of Interest on the Notes (if the holder is an institutional investor, the holder itself is deemed to be the beneficial owner); and (b) deposit the Notes together with the coupons relating to such Notes in due time directly or indirectly with an Italian authorized financial Intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediary). 301 ----- Where the Notes and the relevant coupons are not deposited with an authorized Intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediary), imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld: (a) by any Italian bank or any Italian intermediary paying Interest to the holders of the Notes; or (b) by the Issuer, and gross recipients that are Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected are entitled to deduct any imposta sostitutiva suffered from income taxes due. Interest accrued on the Notes would be included in the corporate taxable income (and in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the holders of the Notes, also in the net value of production for purpose of regional tax on productive activities—IRAP) of the holders of the Notes who are Italian resident corporations or similar commercial entities or permanent establishments in Italy or foreign corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected, subject to tax in Italy in accordance with ordinary tax rules. Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with entrepreneurial activity who have opted for the Asset Management Option are subject to a 26% annual substitute tax (the “Asset Management Tax”) on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year (which increase would include Interest accrued on the Notes). The Asset Management Tax is applied on behalf of the taxpayer by the managing authorized intermediary. Interest accrued on the Notes held by Italian investment funds, SICAVs and SICAFs is not subject to the _imposta sostitutiva, but is included in the aggregate income of the Italian investment funds, SICAVs and SICAFs._ The Italian investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs will not be subject to taxation on such result, but a withholding tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to distributions made in favor of unitholders or shareholders (the “Collective Investment Fund Substitute Tax”). Where an Italian resident noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Decree No. 252) and the Notes are deposited with an Italian resident intermediary, Interest relating to the Notes and accrued during the holding period will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period, to be subject to a 20% substitute tax on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year (which increase would include Interest accrued on the Notes). Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, interest, premium and other income relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114) of Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016 (“Finance Act 2017”), as subsequently amended and supplemented. Where a holders of the Notes is an Italian resident real estate investment fund or a SICAF to which the provisions of Italian Law Decree No. 351 of September 25, 2001, as subsequently amended, apply, Interest accrued on the Notes will be subject neither to imposta sostitutiva, nor to any other income tax in the hands of the Italian real estate investment fund or the SICAF. The income of the Italian real estate investment fund or the SICAF is subject to tax, in the hands of the unitholder, depending on the status and percentage of participation, or, when earned by the fund, through distribution and/or upon redemption or disposal of the units. _Non-Italian Resident Holders of the Notes_ Pursuant to Decree No. 239, payments of Interest in respect of the Notes issued by the Issuer falling within the definitions set out in “—Italian Resident Holders of the Notes” above will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva at the rate of 26%, provided that: (a) the payments are made to non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes with no permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected; (b) such beneficial owners are resident, for tax purposes, in White List States; and (c) all the requirements and procedures set forth in Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules, as subsequently amended, in order to benefit from the exemption from imposta sostitutiva, are complied with in due time. The 26% imposta sostitutiva may generally be reduced to 10% or to zero under certain applicable double tax treaties entered into by Italy, if more favorable, subject to timely filing of required documentation provided by Measure of the Director of Italian Revenue Agency No. 2013/84404 of July 10, 2013. 302 ----- Decree No. 239 also provides for additional exemptions from imposta sostitutiva for payments of Interest in respect of the Notes made to (i) international entities and organizations established in accordance with international agreements ratified in Italy, (ii) “institutional investors,” whether or not subject to tax, which are established in White List States and (iii) “Central Banks” or entities which manage, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State. To ensure payment of Interest in respect of the Notes without the application of 26% imposta sostitutiva, non-Italian resident investors indicated above must: (a) be the beneficial owners of payments of Interest on the Notes (if the holder is an institutional investor, the holder itself is deemed to be the beneficial owner); (b) deposit the Notes in due time together with the coupons relating to such Notes directly or indirectly with an Intermediary, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian bank or financial intermediary, or with a non-Italian resident operator participating in a centralized securities management system which is in contact via computer with the Ministry of Economy and Finance; and (c) file in due time with the relevant depository a declaration (autocertificazione) stating, inter alia, that he or she is a resident, for tax purposes, in a White List State. Such declaration (autocertificazione) which must comply with the requirements set forth by an Italian Decree of the Ministry for the Economy and Finance of December 12, 2001 (as amended and supplemented), is valid until withdrawn or revoked and need not be submitted where a certificate, declaration or other similar document meant for equivalent uses was previously submitted to the same depository. The declaration (autocertificazione) is not required for non-Italian resident investors that are international entities and organizations established in accordance with international agreements ratified in Italy and Central Banks or entities which manage, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign state. Failure of a non-resident holders of the Notes to comply in due time with the procedures set forth in Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules will result in the application of imposta sostitutiva on Interest payments to a non-resident holders of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian resident individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decrees No. 509/1994 and No. 103/1996 may be exempt from any income taxation, including the _imposta sostitutiva, on interest, premium and other income relating to the Notes if the Notes are included in a_ long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth under Italian tax law. Under the so called “tax declaration regime,” which is the standard regime for taxation of capital gains realized by Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities to the extent that they do not opt for the “risparmio amministrato” regime or the Asset Management Option, the 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains net of any relevant incurred capital losses realized by Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities pursuant to all investment transactions carried out during any given tax year. The capital gains realized in a year net of any relevant incurred capital losses must be detailed in the relevant annual tax return to be filed with Italian tax authorities and _imposta sostitutiva must be paid on such capital gains by Italian resident individuals together with any balance_ income tax due for the relevant tax year. Alternatively, holders of the Notes who are Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities to which the Notes are connected, may elect to pay imposta sostitutiva separately on capital gains realized on each sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes (“risparmio _amministrato” regime). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to:_ (a) the Notes being deposited with an Intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of a foreign intermediary); and 303 ----- (b) an express election for the so called risparmio amministrato regime being made in writing in due time by the relevant holder of the Notes. The Intermediary is responsible for accounting for imposta sostitutiva in respect of capital gains realized on each sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes, as well as on capital gains realized as at revocation of its mandate, net of any relevant incurred capital losses, and is required to pay the relevant amount to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the holder of the Notes, deducting a corresponding amount from proceeds to be credited to the holder of the Notes. Where a sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes results in a capital loss, the intermediary is entitled to deduct such loss from gains of the same kind subsequently realized on assets held by the holder of the Notes within the same relationship of deposit in the same tax year or in the following tax years up to the fourth. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, any realized capital gain is not required to be included in the annual income tax return of the holders of the Notes and the holders of the Notes remains anonymous. Special rules apply if the Notes are part of (i) a portfolio managed under the Asset Management Option by an Italian asset management company or an authorized intermediary or (ii) an Italian Organismo di Investimento _Collettivo del Risparmio (which includes a Fondo Comune di Investimento, SICAV or SICAF). In both cases,_ capital gains on the Notes will not be subject to 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains. In particular, under the Asset Management Option, any capital gain realized on of the Notes, even if not realized, will contribute to determine the annual accrued appreciation of the managed portfolio, subject to the Asset Management Tax. Any depreciation of the managed portfolio accrued at year end may be carried forward against appreciation accrued in each of the four subsequent years. Under the Asset Management Option the realized capital gain is not required to be included in the annual income tax return of the holders of the Notes. In the case of Notes held by Italian investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs, capital gains on Notes contribute to determine the increase in value of the managed assets of the Italian investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs accrued at the end of each tax year. The Italian investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs will not be subject to taxation on such increase, but the Collective Investment Fund Substitute Tax will apply, in certain circumstances, to distributions made in favor of unitholders or shareholders. Any capital gains realized by a holders of the Notes that is an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Decree No. 252) and the Notes are deposited with an Italian resident intermediary, will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period, to be subject to a 20% on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year (which increase would include Interest accrued on the Notes). Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital gains on the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di _risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114) of Finance Act 2017, as_ subsequently amended. Where a holders of the Notes is an Italian real estate investment fund or a SICAF, to which the provisions of Italian Law Decree No. 351 of September 25, 2001, as subsequently amended, apply, capital gains realized will be subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax in the hands of the real estate investment fund or the SICAF. The income of the Italian real estate investment fund or the Italian SICAF is subject to tax, in the hands of the unitholder, depending on the status and percentage of participation, or, when earned by the fund, through distribution and/or upon redemption or disposal of the units. Any capital gains realized by Italian resident corporations or similar commercial entities or permanent establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident corporations to which the Notes are connected or Italian resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, will be included in their business income (and, in certain cases, may also be included in the taxable net value of production for IRAP purposes), subject to tax in Italy according to the relevant ordinary tax rules. _Non-Italian Resident Holders of the Notes_ The 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains may in certain circumstances be payable on any capital gains realized upon sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes by non-Italian resident individuals and corporations without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, if the Notes are held in Italy. However, any capital gains realized by non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected through the sale for consideration or redemption of the Notes are 304 ----- exempt from taxation in Italy to the extent that the Notes are listed on a regulated market in Italy or abroad, and in certain cases subject to timely filing of required documentation (in the form of a declaration (autocertificazione) of non-residence in Italy) with Italian qualified intermediaries (or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries) with which the Notes are deposited, even if the Notes are held in Italy and regardless of the provisions set forth by any applicable double tax treaty. Where the Notes are not listed on a regulated market in Italy or abroad: (a) Pursuant to the provisions of Decree No. 461, non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes with no permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected are exempt from _imposta sostitutiva in Italy on any capital gains realized upon sale for consideration or redemption of_ the Notes if they are resident for tax purposes in a White List State. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected elect for the Asset Management Option or are subject to the _risparmio amministrato regime, exemption from Italian capital gains tax will apply provided that they_ timely file with the authorized financial intermediary an appropriate declaration (autocertificazione) stating that they meet the requirement indicated above. The same exemption applies in case the beneficial owners of the Notes are (i) international entities or organizations established in accordance with international agreements ratified by Italy; (ii) certain foreign institutional investors, whether or not subject to tax, established in White List States; or (iii) Central Banks or entities which manage, inter _alia, the official reserves of a foreign State._ (b) In any event, non-Italian resident individuals or entities without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected that may benefit from a double taxation treaty with Italy, providing that capital gains realized upon sale or redemption of the Notes are to be taxed only in the country of tax residence of the recipient, will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva in Italy on any capital gains realized upon sale for consideration or redemption of the Notes. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected elect for the Asset Management Option or are subject to the risparmio _amministrato regime, exemption from Italian capital gains tax will apply provided that they timely file_ with the authorized financial intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a statement from the competent tax authorities of the country of residence of the non-Italian residents. The risparmio amministrato regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to non-resident persons and entities in relation to the Notes deposited for safekeeping or administration with Italian banks, SIMs and other eligible entities, but non-resident holders of the Notes retain the right to waive this regime.

Drawing extensively on the intergovernmental approach to implementing the United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, the OECD developed the Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) to address the issue of offshore tax evasion on a global basis. Aimed at maximizing efficiency and reducing cost for financial institutions, the CRS provides a common standard for due diligence, reporting and exchange of financial account information. Pursuant to the CRS, participating jurisdictions will obtain from reporting financial institutions, and automatically exchange with exchange partners on an annual basis, financial information with respect to all reportable accounts identified by financial institutions on the basis of common due diligence and reporting procedures. The first information exchanges began in 2017.

MergerCo, as the surviving entity, will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes. Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position (to the extent we are required to do so) that these transactions will not be treated as resulting in a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If this position is respected, a U.S. Holder would not recognize any income, gain or loss in connection with such transactions and would have the same adjusted tax basis in the Notes as the U.S. Holder had in the original Notes exchanged therefor. Moreover, the holding period for the Notes would generally include the holding period for the original Notes. It is possible, however, that the IRS could take a contrary view, and seek to treat the Post-Completion Merger and the assumption of the obligations under the Notes by MergerCo as resulting in a taxable exchange of the Notes for “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If so, U.S. Holders would recognize any gain or loss in connection with such taxable exchange (although any such loss could be disallowed) and would have a new holding period and new tax basis in the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, if the fair market value of the Notes at the time of the Post-Completion Merger is less than the principal amount of the Notes (by more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount), such Notes may be treated as issued with OID, in which case the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Notes may be different than what is described below.

If any such payment is treated as a contingent payment, subject to certain exceptions, the Notes may be treated as contingent payment debt instruments, in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income recognized may be different from the consequences discussed herein. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of such additional amounts being payable on the Notes is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations as of the date hereof, and thus does not result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations. Therefore, we do not intend to treat such potential additional payments as part of the yield to maturity of the Notes. Our determination that these contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless such U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue income on its Notes in excess of stated interest, and to treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain any income recognized on the taxable disposition of a Note. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisor regarding the tax consequences if the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

A U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro denominated interest payment on a Note based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. No foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be recognized with respect to the receipt of such payment (other than foreign currency exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the euros so received, See “—Exchange of _Foreign Currency”._ A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting (or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will accrue interest income (as ordinary income) on a Note in euros and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on: - the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period, or portion thereof, within such U.S. Holder’s taxable year; or - at such U.S. Holder’s election, at the spot rate of exchange on (1) the last day of the accrual period, or the last day of the taxable year within such accrual period if the accrual period spans more than one taxable year, or (2) the date of receipt, if such date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period.

In such a case, the amount of OID on the Notes will equal the excess of (i) the sum of all principal and stated interest payments provided by the Note over (ii) the issue price (as defined above) of the Note. If the Notes are issued with OID, a U.S. Holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) generally will be required to include in gross income (as ordinary income) any OID as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis, before the holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to this income. The amount of OID, if any, includible in gross income for a taxable year will be the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during that taxable year on which the U.S. Holder holds the Note. Generally, the daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” (other than the initial short accrual period and the final accrual period) a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The OID allocable to any accrual period will equal (a) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the Note as of the beginning of such accrual period and the Note’s “yield to maturity” (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period) less (b) the qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The term “qualified stated interest generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that is treated as constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate or, under certain circumstances, at a variable rate. Stated interest on the Notes should be treated as qualified stated interest. The “yield to maturity” is the discount rate that, when applied to all payments under a Note as of its issue date, results in a present value equal to the Note’s issue price. The amount of OID allocable to any initial short accrual period generally may be computed under any reasonable method. The amount of OID allocable to the final accrual period is the difference between the stated principal amount of the Note and the adjusted issue price of the Note at the beginning of the final accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note as of the beginning of any accrual period generally will equal its issue price, increased by previously accrued OID. Under these rules, a U.S. Holder of a Note issued with OID generally will be required to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. Under the Treasury regulations, a holder of a Note with OID may elect to include in gross income all interest that accrues on the Note using the constant yield method. Once made with respect to the Note, the election cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder considering an election under these rules should consult its own tax advisor. The accrual of OID on a Note will be computed in euros, and the amount of accrued OID determined for any accrual period then will be translated into U.S. dollars, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting and in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above in “—Payments of Stated Interest.” Upon receipt of a payment attributable to OID on a Note (whether in connection with a payment on such Note or the sale, exchange or other disposition of such Note), a U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar amount of OID that such holder has previously included in income and the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating any euros received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received). Generally, any such exchange gain or loss will be treated as U.S. source and will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as interest income or expense. For this purpose, all payments on a Note generally will be viewed first as the payment of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first, and thereafter as the payment of principal. 310 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations.

Subject to the discussion below, the adjusted tax basis of a Note to a U.S. Holder will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase increased by any previously accrued OID. The amount realized by a U.S. Holder upon the disposition of a Note will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the euros received calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. If the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting, and if it so elects, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting, will determine the dollar value of its adjusted tax basis in such Note and the amount realized on the disposition of a Note by translating euro amounts at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or the disposition, respectively. The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders discussed above must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Notes exceeds one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. Capital gain or loss, if any, recognized by U.S. Holder generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale, exchange, retirement at maturity, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is attributable to changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate during the period in which the U.S. Holder held such Note. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date (1) the Note is disposed of (or the spot rate on the settlement date, if applicable) and (2) of purchase (or the spot rate on the settlement date, if applicable). In addition, upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of the Notes, a U.S. Holder may realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued interest or accrued OID, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” and “—Original _Issue Discount,” respectively.

On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted in favor of Brexit. There remains considerable uncertainty and there is likely to be uncertainty for some time to come as to the impact Brexit will have on the regulatory environment in the EU and the United Kingdom, and on the applicability of EU law in the United Kingdom. In a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario in particular, it will likely be harder for United Kingdom office holders and United Kingdom restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in Member States and to effectively deal with assets located in those other Member States. Much depends upon the private international law rules in the particular Member State and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular, in cases where the appointment of a United Kingdom office holder has been made in reliance on a United Kingdom domestic approach, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant Member State even if United Kingdom jurisdiction is taken on the grounds of a United Kingdom center of main interests or establishment (where such concepts are retained as a matter of United Kingdom domestic law). The below guidance as to center of main interests and any cross-border proceedings within the EU should be construed as a description of the current law as at the date of this Offering Memorandum. Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (which entered into force on June 26, 2017 and applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after that date) replacing Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000, (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “center of main interests” (which according to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation is “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular _basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency_ proceedings (subject to certain exceptions). The determination of where a company has its “center of main _interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even_ conflicting views. The second sentence of Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that a company’s “center of main interests shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation the “center _of main interests” of a company is presumed to be in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the_ absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Furthermore, preamble 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that “it should be possible to _rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State.” The courts have taken into consideration a_ number of factors in determining the “center of main interests” of a company, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the center of the company’s operations. A company’s “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition unless (as set forth 316 ----- above) the registered office has been moved within the three month period prior to the filing of the insolvency petition. If the center of main interests of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be opened in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to open the types of insolvency proceedings. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the “center of main interests” of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open (subject to certain exceptions) secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean a place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State (other than Denmark) are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the company has an establishment only where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s center of main interests is situated under that Member State law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of the establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the company. The courts of all of the Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing the main proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions), which will be given the same effect in the other Member States (other than Denmark) so long as no secondary proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there and subject to certain other exceptions (for instance, rights in rem situated in another Member State remain subject to the original laws governing such rights). The insolvency practitioner appointed or confirmed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the company’s center of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations (for instance, the powers are available so long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets). In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the EU Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency proceedings of several members of a group of companies opened in one or more Member States (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or the Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would 317 ----- be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where public companies are involved. Insolvency laws and regulations have recently been substantially reviewed and significant amendments are expected in the near future. In particular, the Italian Government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 contending the scheme of a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter _alia, insolvency matters (so called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” hereinafter the “Insolvency Code”)._ The Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019, No. 38—Suppl. Ordinario No. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato _preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid_ insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. Pursuant to the Law Decree No. 23 of April 8, 2020, entry into force of the Insolvency Code has further been postponed to September 1, 2021. Therefore, the practical consequences of its implementation and its potential impact on the existing insolvency proceedings cannot to date be foreseen and significant amendments are expected in the near future that may impact the provisions set forth therein. Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts. In this respect, the most recent reforms that have been implemented by the Italian Government on the main Italian bankruptcy legislation, as defined below, are: (i) the reform approved on June 23, 2015 through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian bankruptcy law (the “Decree 83/2015”). The Decree entered into force in June 2015 (the date of its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by Italian Law No. 132 of August 6, 2015, effective August 21, 2015 (the date after its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) (“Law 132”); and (ii) the amendments implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016. The two primary aims of Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the main Italian bankruptcy legislation), as reformed and currently in force (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”) are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or 318 ----- one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent rather than a temporary status of insolvency in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. The following debt restructuring and bankruptcy alternatives are available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and, particularly, that it ensures that the debts of the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within a 120-day term from (i) the date of sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. 319 ----- The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any interim relief or enforcement actions over the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to preexisting debts. The 60 days moratorium can be requested, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, to the court by the debtor pending negotiations with creditors (prior to the above mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the debtor to supply to the creditors the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium. In such hearing, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the agreement and the court assesses whether the conditions for granting the moratorium have been met and, if the court so determines, orders that no interim relief, conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which the restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert has to be deposited. The court’s order may be challenged within fifteen days of its publication. Within the same deadline of 60 days, an application for the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. The court will, after having settled the oppositions (if any), validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which may be appealed within fifteen days of its publication. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning (omologazione) of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors. Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the approval of financial creditors representing at least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category and ask the court to declare such agreement binding on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”), subject to certain conditions being met, including that treatment of dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other available alternative and that all creditors (adhering and non-adhering) have been informed about the negotiations and have been allowed to take part in them in good faith. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the remaining 25% of non-participating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the lack of homogeneity of the classes of creditors. The debtor may also enter into a moratorium arrangement (convenzione di moratoria) with its creditors representing 75% of that debtor’s aggregate financial indebtedness which are banks and financial intermediaries by which also the non-consenting banks and financial intermediaries are bound, provided that (i) they have been informed of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate to such negotiations in good faith and (ii) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies that the non-consenting banks and financial intermediaries have legal status and economic interests similar to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the moratorium arrangement. The purpose is to prevent modestly exposed bank and financial creditors from blocking restructuring operations involving more exposed bank and financial creditors, resulting in the failure of the overall restructuring and the opening of a procedure. The banks and financial intermediaries which have not agreed to the moratorium arrangement may file an objection (opposizione) to it within 30 days after having been notified of the moratorium arrangement. In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or the moratorium arrangement may impose on the non-adhering creditors the performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities. 320 ----- Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of non-financial creditors (e.g. trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not participating to a scheme. Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financings granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court supervised Pre Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo)) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financings granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione) of a debt restructuring agreement or a court supervised Pre Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority status is expressly recognized by the court in the context of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement or the approval of the _concordato preventivo. Same provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders up to 80% of their amount._ Pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested, to (i) incur new super senior (prededucibile) indebtedness subject to authorization by the court, (ii) secure such indebtedness via in rem security (“garanzie reali”), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financial indebtedness aims to achieve a better satisfaction of the creditors and (iii) pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, already payable and due, provided that, the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Furthermore, according to the Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2 letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato _preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the_ date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement actions, precautionary measures and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim 321 ----- measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities), (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal, (iii) the division of creditors into classes and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013). The debtor company may file such petition along with (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by creditors referred to in respect of concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco). The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and, if appointed, the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2 letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132, are treated as super senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy 322 ----- Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the superseniority of the claims—which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition. The composition proposal may propose that (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The composition with creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Law 132 abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato proceeding, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the _concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured_ assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if (i) the majority of classes has approved it and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the 323 ----- unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132 sets forth that a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e. a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti _preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the_ application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725
1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,1393,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEE AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1393.2,Italy,1393.2.6,Bankruptcy (Fallimento),"A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in his or her decision; 324 ----- - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; - any act (including payments, pledges and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real property. In this respect, Law 132 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secured creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. - _Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed, by one or more creditors or third parties or the receiver, from the declaration of bankruptcy. By contrast, the debtor or its subsidiaries are only permitted to file such proposal after one year following such declaration, but within two years following the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of _concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured_ assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatment among the classes) and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court ratification is also required. - _Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from the rules of statutory priority by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles. The rules of statutory priority create a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “pre deductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, 325 ----- the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired, the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priority claims are, in order of priority, those of “privileged creditors” (creditori privilegiati; a priority in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgagees (creditori ipotecari), pledgees (creditori prignoratizi) and unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. - _Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to either one year or six months in certain circumstances (please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures—see below—in relation to certain transactions, the claw-back period can be extended to five and three years, respectively) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver / court commissioner, as detailed below. (a) Acts ineffective by operation of law. (i) Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and (ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. (b) Acts that may be avoided at the bankruptcy receiver’s request. (i) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by Article 67 of the above referenced Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: - onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; - payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration; - pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and 326 ----- - pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time the new security was granted. (ii) The following acts and transactions, if made during the vulnerability period or such other period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the other party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: - the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and - the granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration. (iii) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: - a payment for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; - a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank; - a sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of Italian Royal Decree No. 262 of March 16, 1942 (the “Italian Civil Code”), currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; - transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees and security granted by, the debtor pursuant to a plan under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (see “—Out-of-Court _Reorganization Plans (Piani di Risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law” above);_ - a transaction entered into, payment made or security interest granted to implement a _concordato_ _preventivo_ (see “—Court-Supervised _Pre-Bankruptcy_ _Composition_ _with Creditors (Concordato Preventivo)” above) or an accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti under_ Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (see “—Debt Restructuring Agreements with _Creditors Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Accordi di Ristrutturazione dei Debiti)” above);_ - remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and - payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared without effect vis-à-vis the acting creditors within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions through which the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets to the detriment of such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the creditor’s claim originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor in order to cause detriment of such creditor’s rights) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the creditor’s claim originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent scheme). Burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. Law 132 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back / 327 ----- nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo _patrimoniale, i.e., “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out_ by the creditor against the third party purchaser. Finally, as noted above, the EU Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

To be eligible, the relevant company must be insolvent, but demonstrating serious recovery prospects. To qualify for this procedure, the company must have employed at least 200 employees in the year preceding the commencement of the procedure. In addition, it must have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income from sales and services during its last financial year. Any of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor may make a petition to commence an extraordinary administration procedure. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary administration proceedings. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. There are two main phases: a “judicial phase” and an “administrative phase.” (a) _Judicial Phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether the company has serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and within ten days from such filing, the Italian Ministry of the Economic Development (the “Ministry”) shall file an opinion on the admission of the company to the extraordinary administration procedure. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy. (b) _Administrative Phase. Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and an extraordinary commissioner (or commissioners) is appointed by the Ministry. The extraordinary commissioner(s) prepare(s) a plan which can provide for either the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). The plan may also include an arrangement with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner. In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan, failing which the company is declared bankrupt.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative phase. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry 328 ----- following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has / have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario _liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee_ (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary administration proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The court must decide on the request within ten days of the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors. Before the entry into force of Decree 83/2015, debtors could be granted financing with priority status (prededucibilità) before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato _preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) if (i) an expert_ certified that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process or (ii) such financing is provided for by the plan or the agreement, provided in each case that the court approved such priority status.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five years (“revocatoria ordinaria”). Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the 329 ----- debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted within six months prior to the declaration of insolvency with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the Guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents. It should be noted that (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exceptions, all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration and (ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency. In addition, as noted above, the EU Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union. _Certain Limitations on Enforcement_ The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw-back actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Bankruptcy (fallimento)” above. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by any guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects: (a) the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed above relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; 330 ----- (b) an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Italian court; (c) with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; (d) claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni and decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; (e) pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets and are equally liquid and payable; (f) where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; (g) the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione _necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to_ Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; (h) there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; (i) enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del _diritto);_ (j) the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; (k) any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); (l) an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; (m) an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; (n) in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court; (o) the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure / attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure / attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto)) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding / bankruptcy proceedings; 331 ----- (p) in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; (q) there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; (r) the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; (s) penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; (t) Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; (u) a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and (v) in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas / shares. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: (a) that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and (b) that, in the case of non-gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that said third party participated in the fraudulent design.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case-by-case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for downstream security or guarantee (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and 332 ----- effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity incorporated under the laws of Italy depends on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of the Italian Banking Act, whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, Paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company. In the light of the above, the Company as Guarantor shall not undertake to guarantee financial indebtedness which was incurred, in full or in part, to purchase its shares and which would therefore constitute the provision of financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 and/or Article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code and/or any other law or regulation having the same effect, as interpreted by Italian courts unless in compliance with the limitations and exceptions set forth therein.

By virtue of these limitations, the Company’s obligations under its Guarantee will be significantly less than the amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or the Company may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.

As of the date on this Offering Memorandum, the validity and enforceability of guarantees and/or security granted by virtue of the Whitewash Procedure have not been tested before the Italian courts. Pursuant to the Italian Civil Code, the Whitewash Procedure must be carried out as follows: (i) the credit support to be granted by the Company under its Guarantee, the Company Collateral and the guarantee to be granted by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan must be authorized at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of the Company; and (ii) the board of directors of the Company must prepare a written report (to be deposited at the registered office of the Company 30 days prior to the relevant extraordinary shareholders’ meeting (unless such requirement is waived with the consent of the Company’s shareholder and the Company’s statutory auditors)) indicating the reasons for providing the Guarantee, the Company Collateral and the guarantee to be granted by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan, the impact of providing the Guarantee, the Company Collateral and the guarantee to be granted by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan on the Company’s solvency, the specific purpose for providing the Guarantee, the Company Collateral and the guarantee to be granted by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan, the risk factors associated with providing the Guarantee, the Company Collateral and the guarantee to be granted by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan with reference to the liquidity, the solvency and the price of purchase and/or subscription of the shares in the Company. The board of directors’ report shall also state that the transaction pursue at the best conditions the corporate benefit of the company. The board of directors of the Company will also need to verify that the provision of the Guarantee, the Company Collateral and the guarantee to be granted by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan is provided on “market conditions”, including with specific reference to the Notes, the interest rate of the Notes, the New Term Loan, the interest rate of the New Term Loan and the creditworthiness of the Issuer. Under article 2358, paragraph 6, of the Italian Civil Code, the ability of holders of the Notes to recover on the Guarantee and the Company Collateral, as well as the ability of the finance parties under the New Term Loan to recover from the guarantee to be granted by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan and the Company Collateral, will at any time be limited to an amount not greater than that of the distributable profits and the available reserves as set out in the most recent “duly approved financial statements” of the Company, and will in any event be subject to the additional limitations a set out in “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Notes, the _Guarantee and the Security Interests—Once granted, the Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain_ 335 ----- _limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability”, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security Interests—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations of the Guarantee and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and the Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral” and “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the guarantee and the security interests—Italy—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and Security Interests Under Italian Law—Limitations to the Guarantees and Collateral”. In this respect, the form of_ the Guarantee to be provided by the Company, the form of guarantee to be provided by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan and the relevant security documents to be entered into by the Company will reflect the foregoing limitations as to the amount of the obligations that will be guaranteed and secured in respect of the Notes and the New Term Loan, as the case may be, by the Company, upon completion of the Whitewash Procedure. See “Description of the Notes—Guarantees”. The financial statements of the Company, for the purpose of determining the amount of its distributable profits (if any) and available reserves for the purposes of the Whitewash Procedure, are envisaged to be those that will be approved with respect to the financial year ending on December 31, 2020. In addition, under Article 2358, paragraph 6, of the Italian Civil Code, reserves which are not distributable in an amount equal to the guarantees issued or security granted in respect of a principal debt obligation must be accounted for as liability in the financial statements of the relevant Italian security provider/guarantor. Accordingly, a corresponding amount of profits and/or reserves will not be available for distribution by the Company until the Guarantee, the Company Collateral and the guarantee to be granted by the Company in relation to the New Term Loan have been released or discharged, as applicable. In addition, to the extent losses are recorded by the Company at any time, any such losses could reduce reserves relating to the credit support previously provided by the Company in connection with the Whitewash Procedure; such losses could arise in the ordinary course of business or in connection with contingent liabilities and it has been held by prevailing legal analysis that losses will only erode any such reserves after full impairment of other reserves and share capital.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the Notes or in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, Paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf the holders of the Notes, which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, Paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the security under the Security Documents and/or that the rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of Paragraph 3 of Article 2414-bis, Paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is only granted in favor of the rappresentante, the holders of Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral. Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative (rappresentante comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code may be validly appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of such appointment may not be upheld by a court. 336 ----- Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a _società per azioni._ Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s (and, following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo’s) relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans, including to the Issuer’s relationship with the Company under the Funding Loan. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note (including any obligations of the Company under the Funding Loan) be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer (and, following the PostCompletion Merger, MergerCo) may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries (including any amounts under the Funding Loan granted to the Company), which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s (and, following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo’s) ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans (including any obligations of the Company under the Funding Loan) or notes are subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries (including the Guarantee) may be impaired or restricted. 337 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit the Initial Purchasers to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the Offering, the Stabilization Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilization Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilization Manager may also over-allot the offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilization Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilization Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time.

This plan concerns options for the subscription of shares of Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A As part of the plan, participants are assigned 911,759 options, granted free of charge to beneficiaries. The options, when exercisable, entitle each to subscribe one share (of special class B), corresponding to 7.5% of the share capital before the dedicated increase. The options are divided into three pools: a first pool of 897,718 options and a second and third pool of equal number of options for the remainder. The exercise price of each option belonging to the first pool is equal to Euro 42.15 per share, while the exercise price of each option belonging to the second and third pools will instead be determined by the Board of Directors annually on the basis of “Fair Market Value” of the Company on the date of such determination.

In this case, the beneficiary will not have the right to demand the issue of shares and the options attributed to it will lose their effectiveness. Despite the faculty attributed to the Board of Directors to choose between cash payment and issue of equity instruments, the directors believe that the Company does not present any current obligation to pay cash at the balance sheet date. Therefore, the plan was accounted for as a share-based payment transaction. The shares subscribed by the beneficiary following the exercise of the options are available from the day following the expiry date of the plan.

Our checks were carried out according to the rules of conduct of the Board of Statutory Auditors set out by the National Council of Chartered Accountants and Accounting Experts. The Group has adopted the International Accounting Standards—IFRS since 2005. The Board reports that it has carried out the usual exchange of information, pursuant to Article 2409-septies of the Italian Civil Code, with the company in charge of the Group’s statutory audit, Deloitte & Touche S.p.A The financial statements of the individual subsidiaries have been duly approved by the respective competent administrative bodies and subjected to auditing within the limits and according to the methods set out in the auditing plan defined by the Statutory Auditor and deemed adequate and sufficient in order to express the required professional opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. We have read the consolidated financial statements of the Group as at 31 December 2019 and we have ascertained that the identification of the consolidation area and the choice of the principles of consolidation of the equity investments, as well as the procedures adopted for this purpose, comply with the legal requirements and the accounting principles applicable in this case, including, from 1 January 2019, the new IFRS 16, whose impact on the consolidated financial statements has been duly illustrated in the Explanatory Notes. The Board of Statutory Auditors has taken note that the Statutory Auditor, Deloitte & Touche S.p.A., with its report dated 10 April 2020, also expressed an opinion with no findings, comments or emphasis of matter, on the consolidated financial statements closed on 31 December 2019. Having regard also to the opinion expressed by the Statutory Auditor, we certify that the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2019 have been prepared in compliance with the provisions of Legislative Decree no. 127/1991 and subsequent amendments. The criteria adopted by the Board of Directors in the financial statement assessments and value adjustments, duly detailed in the Explanatory Notes to the consolidated financial statements, are inspired by the general and usual criteria within the perspective of business continuity. We checked the Directors’ report on the Group’s management performance, which accompanies the consolidated financial statements, in order to verify compliance with the minimal content required by applicable legislation. Based on the checks carried out, the Board believes that the Group’s management report is correct and exhaustive and is consistent with the consolidated financial statements. The Board also took note of the report approved by the Directors concerning the Impairment Test relating to intangible assets with an indefinite useful life recorded in the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2019, which confirmed the sustainability of the values recorded in the assets, as no evidence emerged of lasting losses of value. Taking into account that the criteria and methods used for the test, as well as the relative results, which are duly detailed in the Explanatory Notes, the Board has no comments to make in this regard. Considering also the results of the activity carried out by the subject in charge of the statutory audit of the accounts contained in the audit report of the consolidated financial statements issued on 10 April 2020, which is not qualified and contains no emphasis of matter, the Board believes that it has no reports to make on the consolidated financial statements.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2018, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. _Basis for Opinion_ We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the _Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of Engineering Ingegneria_ Informatica S.p.A. (“Company”) in accordance with the ethical requirements applicable under Italian law to the audit of the financial statements.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they have identified the existence of the conditions for the liquidation of the Company or the termination of the business or have no realistic alternatives to such choices.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s Internal control. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors. - Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

The Group operates in Software and IT Services with a leading position in numerous vertical sectors, due to a wide range of proprietary solutions, from banking compliance (SISBA, ELISE), to Billing and CRM for Utilities (Net@SUITE), to integrated diagnostics and administration solutions for Healthcare (AREAS), WFM systems (OVER.IT) and mobile platforms for TLC. During the period, the worldwide lived a recent and rapid development of the COVID-19 pandemic, where many countries have imposed limitation or suspension of certain commercial activities and adopted travel restrictions and quarantine measures. The COVID-19 pandemic occurred in China in December 2019 and continued to evolve gradually. On January 30, 2020, the WHO International Emergency Standards Committee declared the pandemic a “public health emergency of international concern”. Since then, more cases have been diagnosed, including in other countries. In Italy, the pandemic initially affected the Northern regions and subsequently spread to the rest of the country. The Italian government issued several decrees of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, which introduced increasingly restrictive measures for commercial activities and social aggregation in order to contain the risk of contagion. In this context, preceding the decree of the Italian Government, which came into force on March 23, 2020, and temporarily suspended all non-essential production activities, the Group has progressively limited activities to customers and / or operating offices being able to work in smart working. Indeed, the use of cloud systems and advanced individual productivity systems have allowed a rapid reconfiguration of activities in smart working mode ensuring the safety of the Group’s employees and the continuation of the activities contracted with customers. In addition, Engineering as part of its activities is able to manage remotely the workstations of customers turning them into a “Digital Workplace”; this technology helps and supports the new way of working required in the current scenario. In the current complex market situation, we are focused on supporting our clients, the Italian Government and in particular the Italian healthcare sector, in order to best meet their needs. In this context, all sectors are increasing demands for digitization, from Workplace to remote maintenance, as well as using data management platforms to facilitate decisions. There may be a slowdown in cash collections from certain customers, who may be impacted more significantly by the COVID-19 emergency, compared to what was expected. In any case, the diversification of the sectors in which the Group’s customers operate (Public Administration, Finance, Healthcare, Industry, Transportation, Telco & Media, Energy & Utilities) and the good financial condition, the availability of liquidity and credit lines already approved, are elements mitigating the potential financial and liquidity risk. Moreover, even in a context of general uncertainty related to the effects of COVID-19 at the current time the Directors did not identify critical elements to compromise the compliance with the covenants. In particular, the level of available liquidity should enable the Group to face the coming months, albeit in a context of uncertainty, without recourse to additional sources of funding. However, at the current stage of the COVID-19 context, the scenarios of medium-long term of the Group did not detect clear risks of impairment of the values recorded in the financial statements as of June 30, 2020. The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has resulted, and is likely to continue to result, in significant national and global economic disruption. Based on the Company’s current assessment, the Company does not expect any material impact on its existing development timeline and its liquidity due to the worldwide spread of the F-8 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

However, the Company is actively monitoring this situation and the possible effects on its business, results of operations and financial condition, including expenses and employee-related amounts through temporary Government subsidy programs (so called “Cassa integrazione”). In particular, we transitioned substantially all of our 11,600 employees to remote working. Additionally, to manage our cost structure and reduce our cash burn, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our travel and marketing costs and placed a limited number of our projects as well as employees within certain specific functions (such as our internal travel agency) on temporary government subsidy programs. The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our supply chain is limited as our suppliers and partners are able to work remotely and our reliance on physical product deliveries is limited. Even in a context of general uncertainty related to the effects of COVID-19, based on the Company’s current operating business plan and existing cash and cash equivalents the Company has determined that there are not significant uncertainties regarding its ability to continue as a going concern.

Servizi S.r.l.’s financial statements, properly adjusted to make them compliant with the accounting standards and evaluation methods applied in the preparation of these Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Based on the ongoing evaluation activities, the following balance sheet items could be impacted: intangible assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related economic effects. The provisional fair value of the receivables acquired and the gross contractual amounts receivable is Euro 1.3 million. At the acquisition date there are not any contractual cash flows not expected to be collected. The full consolidation from the acquisition date of the business combination led to the recognition of revenues and loss in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Engineering group, equal respectively to Euro 0.1 million and (Euro 0.01 million).

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which covers a period of at least twelve months from the date of the interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position. The accounting policies and the critical judgements in applying the accounting polices during the condensed consolidated half-year financial statements are consistent with those described in the Group’s annual financial statements referred above _Key sources of estimation uncertainty_ The preparation of the financial statements in compliance with IFRS also requires the use of estimates and assumptions in determining the values of the assets and liabilities, costs and revenues and contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the reporting date and on prior experience where the book value of assets and liabilities is not easily inferable from other sources. However, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions periodically revised and changes are immediately reflected in the income statement. The items that are mostly influenced by estimates are the calculation of amortisation/depreciation, impairment tests on assets (including measurement of receivables), provisions for allocations, employee benefits, fair value of financial liabilities, deferred tax assets and liabilities and customer contracts assets. For a better understanding of the financial statements, the main estimates utilised in the drawing up of the financial statements are shown hereunder and involve the use of subjective opinions, assumptions and estimates related to issues that are uncertain by nature. The changes in conditions underlying the opinions and assumptions might have a significant impact on the following financial years. _Impairment of assets (Goodwill Euro 104 million and Trademark Euro 453 million)_ As explained in more detail in note 10 hereof, for the calculation of the value in use of Cash Generating Units, the Group has taken into account, with reference to the specified period, the expected trends resulting from F-13 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The impairment test carried out, based on these forecasts, did not generate any write-downs. _Purchase Price Allocation (IFRS 3)_ As explained in the paragraph “Acquisition for the year”, the recognition of business combination transactions implies the allocation of the payment of acquisition to the assets and liabilities of the acquired company, which are evaluated at fair value. The possible difference, if positive, is recorded as goodwill; if negative, it is recorded in the income statement. In the process of assigning amounts to certain asset items, the Group applied estimates to determine their fair value. To determine fair value, the Group used valuation methods, including discounted cash flow analysis. To calculate the present value of future cash flows, it is necessary to formulate some assumptions regarding uncertain issues, including management’s expectations regarding: - Marginality of customer portfolios; - The probability of renewal of contracts with customers; - The selection of the discount rate that reflects the risk. The Group’s estimates are based on assumptions deemed reasonable, but uncertain and foreseeable. These assessments require the use of management assumptions, which may not reflect unpredictable events. _Receivable from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A._ As explained in more detail in note 14, trade receivables include receivables from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A., which amounted to Euro 110.7 million (not including the related doubtful debt provision amounting to Euro 27.4 million and the related doubtful debt provision for interest on arrears amounting to Euro 38.1 million), in addition to Euro 14.5 million of customer contract assets. These amounts were related to the IT activities connected with the building of an integrated IT platform for the Sicilian Region, within specifications and provisions set out in the convention signed between the Sicilian Region, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Sicilia e-Servizi Venture S.c.a.r.l. in liquidation (“SISEV” or “Venture”) on May 21, 2007 and expired on December 22, 2013. The Board of Directors, considering the legitimacy of the receivables for the services provided, assessing the appraisal delivered by the independent expert as part of the summons to obtain payment of an amount of their receivables equal to Euro 79,675 thousand as seriously omissive and erroneous and supported by the opinion of the legal sponsor, stated that the receivables from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. are collectable. In any case, considering the continuous change of institutional interlocutors and the difficulty of achieving an amicable agreement, considering the legal dispute and the objections filed by Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and the Sicilian Region, the Group recognised the interest set out by law pertaining to the period considered (Euro 2.8 million) in the income statement and under Financial income, in addition to the amount already recognised until December 31, 2019 (for a total amount of Euro 38.1 million), and accrued additional provision for Euro 2.8 million for a total allowance for expected credit losses of Euro 65.5 million. It includes the total impairment of the statutory interest shown above and recognised in the financial statements and, for the remaining portion, the impairment of the nominal value of the receivable. Below is the Group’s exposure to the counterparty as of June 30, 2020: _Fair value of options of non-controlling interest_ The fair value of the liabilities, which represents a reasonable estimate of the option exercise price, was determined using the discounted operating cash flow method and the long-term plans of the subsidiaries involved. The exercise prices are established on the basis of the agreements contained in the options agreements signed by the Group. _Trade Receivable_ Management closely reviews the outstanding trade receivables, also considering ageing, payment history and credit risk coverage. Expected credit losses are recognized based on management’s best estimates at the reporting date. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Group has not identified any collection issues regarding the trade receivables. Main businesses on which the customers operates have not had material impacts. Public sector and healthcare are receiving more resources for investments. Finance, Telco & Media and Energy & Utilities do not represent business with issues in relation to COVID-19 and are large companies with good credit standing. Manufacturing industry could be segment with more impact, however in this sector the customers are large companies and other primary manufacturing companies. The Group believes the impact of COVID-19 regarding the collectability of receivables will be minimal. Group believes that the impact of COVID-19 may result in a reduction of the backlog portfolio, however, as of today, no significant reduction was noted by management. After assessing historical and forward-looking information, the Group believes that there has not been a significant impact on expected credit losses. _Lease term_ The Group analyzed all the lease agreements, defining the lease term for each of them, given by the “non-cancellable” period together with the effects of any extension or early termination clauses, the exercise of which was deemed reasonably certain. Specifically, for real estate, this evaluation considered the specific facts and circumstances of each activity. As for the other categories of goods, mainly company cars and equipment, the Group has generally deemed it unlikely to exercise any extension or early termination clause in consideration of the practice usually followed by the Group. For the buildings, the Group, in assessing the lease terms, chose, based on business development plans, to consider, in addition to the non-cancellable period, the first renewal period as reasonably certain, not believing that there were facts or circumstances that led to consider additional renewals as reasonably certain.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

In particular, the retrospective change is due to: (i) mainly to the identification and evaluation of the Fair value, pursuant to IFRS 3, of the assets and liabilities of the company Deus Technology S.r.l., which resulted in goodwill at June 30, 2020 of Euro 22,704,961 compared to goodwill at December 31, 2019 of Euro 30.1 million; (ii) mainly to the identification and evaluation of fair values, pursuant to IFRS 3, of the assets and liabilities of the company Digitelematica S.r.l., which resulted in goodwill at June 30, 2020 of Euro 1.9 million compared to goodwill at December 31, 2019 of Euro 3.3 million. The analysis was carried out to determine the recoverable value of the goodwill which is allocated to the Cash Generating Units (CGU) to which it refers. CGU is defined as an asset or small group of assets that generate incoming cash flows that are largerly independent from the incoming cash flows resulting from other assets or group of assets. The CGUs were determined based on the market segments and the single operating investees, consistently with the corporate Management view in terms of monitoring of results and economic planning. For the purposes of preparing the half-year financial statements and in consideration of the potential effects deriving from COVID-19, it was deemed appropriate to subject the CGUs considered to be more risky and that could be affected by any negative effects in their respective long-term economic / financial plans to impairment tests. Below is the list of tested CGUs: - Telco & Media - Pal and Tributi - OverIT - Enginering ITS AG - Sogeit Solutions - Deus Technology The impairment test carried out at June 30, 2020 on the goodwill allocated to the CGU to which it relates confirmed that there is no need to write-downs on the value disclosed in the financial statements.

The Group has therefore concluded that the expected credit loss for trade receivables represents a reasonable approximation of the losses on customer contract assets. The expected credit loss rates are based on the collection times over a period of 545 days prior to June 30, 2020, and the corresponding losses on historical receivables F-27 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and future macroeconomic conditions affecting customers’ ability to repay loans. The Company has identified the average default rate of Italian companies for the period, considering the effect of COVID-19 pandemic as a relevant factor for receivables from third parties, while it has identified the country risk of Italy as the main factor for receivables from the Public Administration. These factors were used to adjust the historical loss rates recorded. On this basis, the allowance for bad debt to be subject to collective impairment as of June 30, 2020, was determined as follows. On the basis of the model described above, it should be noted that an amount of euro 257 thousand has been accrued as expected credit losses. The following table shows the trade receivables reconciled balance for invoices issued, divide by “overdue” and “not overdue”. order over all receivables from the Sicilian Region to Sicilia Digitale S.p.A., up to the entire amounts receivable accrued by the company. On November 10, 2014, the Court of Palermo rejected SISEV’s request while underlying that “given that, besides Sicilia e-Servizi S.p.A., also the Sicilian Region (via its accountant general), an undoubtedly solvent entity, is directly committed with respect to Sicilia e-Servizi Venture S.c.a.r.l. - ... Omitted ... there is no urgency (periculum in mora) ...”. In other words, the Judge reported no credit risk, while highlighting the “guarantor” role played by the Sicilian Region in favour of SISEV. As regards Sicilia Digitale S.p.A.’s judgement of opposition to the first order decree, deposited on September 3, 2013, obtained in the amount of Euro 30,052 thousand, the Judge ordered Office Technical Experts, to evaluate, inter alia, the actual services rendered by SISEV, which are related to the invoicing subject to the order of payment. On December 17, 2016, the Office Technical Experts, designated for the assessment of the actual performance by Venture of services that are related to the invoicing object of the payment order, transmitted to the parties a first draft of the expertise where a total amount receivable of Euro 28,068 thousand was assessed in favour of Venture; therefore, almost the entire amount claimed in Court was assessed by experts (taking account that in the arrears some payments were received by Venture and today the receivables in question were equal to Euro 28,346 thousand). Following a request of integration by the Judge, the experts therefore issued and lodged the supplementary expertise (in which the assets involved in the payment claim were divided according to the existence or non-existence of approvals by the Management of Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and/or the Region). After filing the supplementary expertise report, following the clarification of the conclusions of the parties involved, with a sentence dated 30 August 2018, the Judge ordered, among other things, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. to pay SISEV Euro 19,508 thousand, plus interest at the rate indicated in the payment order. The Judge therefore confirmed the evaluations expressed by the experts, in the aforementioned supplementary expertise report, considering that only the services certified by SISEV’s managerial figures were “recognised” by SISEV. By a writ of summons on appeal notified on February 18, 2019, Sicilia Digitale appealed against the aforementioned judgment, asking for its complete reform. SISEV appeared with a cross-appeal response asking for recognition of the amounts not included in the Court’s sentence. At the first hearing on May 31, 2019, SISEV requested, in agreement with Sicilia Digitale, postponement for negotiations, granted until July 5, 2019. In fact, on June 12, 2019, a specific transaction was agreed between the transferees of the SISEV credit (Engineering and Accenture, as creditor partners for services rendered and not remunerated at that time) and Sicilia Digitale for the recognition to them of a total amount of Euro 19.5 million (of which Euro 13.2 million in favour of Engineering and Euro 6.3 million in favour of Accenture), with waiver of the interest on arrears and which specifies, among other things, a plan for the repayment of the credit transacted gave the last forecast data expected on May 1, 2020. In addition, the transaction provides that the failure to comply with any time scans for the payment so agreed is provided, for the express provision of the agreement, the resolution of it and the possibility for the creditor parties (Engineering and Accenture) to act for the entire. In the illustrated context, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. has only partially complied with the credit repayment plan contained in the transaction; in fact, it should be noted that so far the amounts provided for by the same writing have not been paid since November 2019. For this reason, a special notice was sent on February 3, 2020 to fulfillment under penalty of termination of the transaction. However, to date, no further payment has been received, in so that it is being considered to proceed with the dissolution of the settlement agreement and the enforcement of the judgement for the higher amount indicated therein. In addition to what has just been illustrated, on February 28, 2016, SISEV sent a writ of summons to obtain the payment of the entire amount of receivables (Euro 79.7 million, including the works recognised in the financial statements to complete the amount already requested with an appeal for an order of payment) as the company deems, as already stated, that these amounts were correctly originated and are correctly payable, also pursuant to provisions contained in the trilateral agreement signed on October 9, 2012 by the Sicilian Region, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and SISEV. Both parties, i.e. the Sicilian Region and Sicilia Digitale S.p.A., appeared and filed objections including, but not limited to, the fact that the measure dated October 9, 2012 was invalid, the service contracts and related orders were null and void and Venture unfulfilled its know-how transfer obligations. The parties also filed a claim for damages for a total amount of Euro 95,643 thousand. These plaintiff’s claims were objected at the first hearing of June 8, 2016. After filing the pre-trial briefs, the Judge reserved on the ruling of all claims submitted, including but not limited to, evidence by SISEV based on documents and expertises. F-30 ----- On May 30, 2018, the technical experts appointed by the Court of Palermo sent the parties and their respective technical experts a draft of the expertise. Given the extent of this report, the Judge was first asked to extend the deadline for replies to the expertise; for this reason, the Judge granted the extension as a request and assigned the parties a deadline until September 30, 2018, to communicate their observations to the expertise, assigning the experts a further deadline until October 30, 2018, to file the final report together with the observations of the parties and setting a hearing on November 8, 2018, for the continuation of the case. The aforementioned final report shows (i) a receivable assessed by SISEV for only Euro 4,198 thousand against a claim of Euro 79,675 thousand and (ii) provides the Judge, as a possible alternative assessment criterion, with a second calculation certifying a total receivable of Euro 26,157 thousand from Venture. The case was adjourned to the hearing of December 12, 2019, for examination by the expertise. Considering the report to be seriously omissive and erroneous, a new request for the renewal of the expertise, pursuant to Article 196 of the Italian Criminal Code, was submitted. It was discussed at the hearing of May 30, 2019, at which the Region and Sicilia Digitale contested the application and asked for its complete rejection. The Judge deferred decision and, as a result, rejected the application for renewal, deducing, as to form, the absence of any breach by the independent expert of the right to be heard and, on the merits, the possibility of detecting any errors in the expert’s report in the decision-making process. At the hearing of December 19, 2019, to which the case was then adjourned, the same was held in judgment. The final briefs are currently being drafted. Please note that, in addition to the above, no specific critical issues or formal claims related to the correct execution of services and good quality of products delivered by SISEV were highlighted by Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and/or the Sicilian Region. Moreover, the above-mentioned claims do not seem prima facie suited to stop the aggregate claims of SISEV. To date, it is therefore deemed that the defence of the summoned parties are not such to affect the evaluation on the collectability of receivables in favour of SISEV. The Directors, considering the legitimacy of the credit lines carried out and the correct execution of the services, assessed the appraisal delivered by the independent expert. as part of the summons to obtain payment of an amount of their receivables equal to Euro 79,675 thousand, as seriously omissive and erroneous consider the receivable from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. to SISEV to be collectable. In any case, considering the continuous change in institutional interlocutors and the difficulty in achieving an amicable agreement, in view of a legal dispute and the objections filed by Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and the Sicilian Region, the Directors, based on the rational of the agreement negotiation (which concerns only a part of receivables), accrued a bed debt provision for Euro 2.8 million, in addition of the previous accruals, for a total doubtful debt provision of Euro 65.5 million, which includes the total impairment of the statutory interest shown above and recognised in the financial statements (amounting to Euro 38.1 million) and, for the remaining portion, the impairment of the nominal value of the receivable (amounting to Euro 27,4 million).",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The subsidiary recognised, instead, a cost of equal amount. The options become exercisable if certain time and performance objectives are achieved (so-called “vested options”). In particular, the time target is achieved—according to the regulation scheme—pro-rata temporis over the period December 2017—December 2020. The options vested can be exercised (i) starting from the plan expiration notice and no later than the working day prior to the plan expiry date and (ii) upon the occurrence of a divestment at any time without any expiry condition. The exercise of vested shares is allowed, without losing any vested rights, even to the so-called “good leaver” beneficiary who has terminated his employment’s relationship. If the so-called “good leaver” beneficiary ceases during the period December 2017—December 2020, the same will be entitled to a pro rata temporis of options to be exercised. In the event that the divestment took place before December 2020, all the options would be considered 100% vested. The fair value of rights assigned is calculated, upon assignment, by using the binomial model to evaluate US options (so-called Cox, Ross and Rubinstein model). In particular, the main input data used to measure the fair value of the Stock Option plan is summarised as follows: - multiple of EV/EBITDA, determined as mean of a panel of listed comparable values; - interest rate curve [IRS 3 YEARS] as of December 31, 2017; - historical volatility [at 260 DAYS], observed as of December 31, 2017; - dividend yield equal to zero for the stock option measurement; - historical series of logarithmic yields for the securities involved; - liquidity discount equal to 20%; - strike price equal to Euro 42.15, contractually determined. The fair value of options granted in the first pool amounted to Euro 43.30 per option. The fair value at the assignment date was determined independently and based on the following parameters for the options granted: - options are granted free; - options accrued are exercisable; - the exercise price is Euro 0; - the concession time is 3.5 years; - the exercise price for each share at the assignment date is Euro 42.15. The number of options available under the plan is 911,759. The total number of shares assigned at June 30, 2020 is 896,441. At June 30, 2020 the reserve for share-based payments amounted to Euro 39.4 million. The increase for the period in the income statement was Euro 10 million. The average workforce is: The average number of employees in the first semester 2020 increased by 592, compared to the previous year.

On the basis of the data used for fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy is identified on the basis of which assets and liabilities measured at fair value or for which fair value is indicated in the financial statement disclosures are classified: a) level 1: includes prices quoted in active markets for assets or liabilities identical to those being valued; b) level 2: includes observable data, different from those included in level 1, such as: (i) prices quoted in active markets for similar or identical assets or liabilities; (ii) prices quoted in non-active markets for similar or identical assets or liabilities; (iii) other observable data (interest rate curves, implicit volatilities, credit spreads); c) level 3: uses non-observable data, which may be used if no observable input data is available. The non-observable data used for fair value measurement purposes reflects the assumptions that market participants would make when pricing the assets and liabilities being measured. Please refer to the table below for the definition of the fair value hierarchy level on the basis of which the individual instruments measured at fair value have been classified. No transfers between the different levels of the fair value hierarchy took place during the year. The fair value of derivative instruments is determined by discounting expected cash flows to present value, using the market interest rate curve at the reference date and the listed credit default swap curve of the counterparty and Group companies, to include the non-performance risk explicitly provided for by IFRS 13. For medium/long-term financial instruments, other than derivative instruments, where market prices are not available, the fair value is determined by discounting expected cash flows, using the market interest rate curve at the reference date and considering the counterparty risk in the case of financial assets and its credit risk in the case of financial liabilities.

1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,3000,INCOME STATEMENT,3000.55,Information on share-based remuneration plan,3000.55.1,,"On 28 June 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a stock option plan for the employees, consultants, collaborators and directors of the Company and certain companies of the Group controlled by the same to encourage the Group’s commitment to growth and the loyalty of the beneficiaries. This plan concerns options for the subscription of shares of Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. As part of the plan, participants are assigned 911,759 options, granted free of charge to beneficiaries. The options, when exercisable, entitle each to subscribe one share (of special class B), corresponding to 7.5% of the share capital before the dedicated increase. The options are divided into three pools: a first pool of 897,718 options and a second and third pool of equal number of options for the remainder. The exercise price of each option belonging to the first pool is equal to Euro 42.15 per share, while the exercise price of each option belonging to the second and third pools will instead be determined by the Board of Directors annually on the basis of “ Fair Market Value ”of the Company on the date of such determination. The options become exercisable if certain time and performance objectives are achieved (so-called “vested options”). These options can only be exercised starting from the notice of expiry of the plan and no later than the business day preceding the expiry date of the plan. The exercise of the options is also subject to the occurrence of a divestment (ie transfer of quotas or shares representing more than 50% of the subscribed and paid-up capital of Engineering, Newco or Holdco; transfer of all Group assets; admission to trading on a regulated market) and will become effective upon completion of the plan on the expiry date of the plan. The shares are made available to the beneficiary on the plan expiry date. On the expiry date of the plan, the Board of Directors has the right to pay the beneficiary in cash the difference between i) the Fair Market Value of the shares due to the beneficiary and ii) the exercise price. In this case, the beneficiary will not have the right to demand the issue of shares and the options attributed to it will lose their effectiveness. Despite the faculty attributed to the Board of Directors to choose between cash payment and issue of equity instruments, the directors believe that the Company does not present any current obligation to pay cash at the balance sheet date. Therefore, the plan was accounted for as a share-based payment transaction. The shares subscribed by the beneficiary following the exercise of the options are available from the day following the expiry date of the plan. On 23 July, an operation was completed that provides for the change of control of the entire share capital of Engineering and with this deed, therefore, the divestment event occurs which will allow the beneficiaries to exercise the options. These financial statements therefore reflect the achievement of 100% of this process. F-52 ----- **AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF ENGINEERING INGEGNERIA INFORMATICA S.P.A.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",3000.56.1,,"_Opinion_ We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. and its subsidiaries (“Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2019, and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2019, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. _Basis for Opinion_ We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the _Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of Engineering Ingegneria_ Informatica S.p.A. (“Company”) in accordance with the ethical requirements applicable under Italian law to the audit of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. _Responsibilities of the Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors for the Consolidated Financial Statements_ The Directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and, within the terms established by law, for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they have identified the existence of the conditions for the liquidation of the Company or the termination of the business or have no realistic alternatives to such choices. The Board of Statutory Auditors is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by law, the Group’s financial reporting process. F-54 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725
1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,3000,INCOME STATEMENT,3000.57,Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements,3000.57.1,,"Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors. - Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

As permitted by IFRS 3, the final recognition of fair value of assets and liabilities of the acquired company will be completed within 12 months from the acquisition date. In relation to current measurements, they will entail effects on the following main items: intangible assets and deferred tax assets and related economic effects. As described in more detail in Note 4.4, the above-mentioned goodwill was tested for impairment, with reference to the date of December 31, 2018, as required by IAS 36, which confirmed its full recoverability. The integral consolidation, at the acquisition date, of the business combination involved the recording of revenues in the consolidated financial statements of the Engineering Group, amounting to Euro 0.1 million. If the acquired company had been consolidated on a line-by-line basis as from January 1, 2018, the 2018 consolidated revenues of the Engineering Group would have been higher by Euro 0.1 million. _Acquisition of control of LG-NET S.r.l._ On July 10, 2018 (hereinafter also “acquisition date”), the wholly controlled company Municipia S.p.A. acquired 76% of the share capital of the company LG-NET S.r.l 13.47 % of the company’s share capital was already owned by the Parent Company Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A Therefore, the Group’s interests on this acquisition is equal to 89.47%.

Furthermore, this goodwill value will be fiscally non-deductible. Based on the valuation activities in progress, effects on the following main items may arise: intangible assets and deferred tax assets and liabilities and related economic effects. The full consolidation from the acquisition date of the business combination in question led to the recognition of revenues and profits in the consolidated financial statements of the Engineering Group equal to Euro 2.3 million and Euro 0.8 million respectively.

In particular, taking into account the relevance of the acquisition, it was considered appropriate to temporarily maintain the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities already recognized in the Deus financial statements, properly adjusted to make them compliant with the accounting principles and evaluation criteria applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements attributing to goodwill the entire difference from the cost of the acquisition. This accounting approach was considered more clear and representative for users of the financial statements, taking into account the substantial impossibility of determining the fair values, albeit provisional, of the assets and liabilities acquired on a reliable basis, thus making it possible to obtain a provisional accounting representation of the effects of the acquisition.

The IFRS standards also include all International Accounting Standards (IAS) and all interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Standard Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC), previously named “Standard Interpretations Committee” (SIC). The IFRS standards have been applied consistently with the periods disclosed herein and, taking account of the best literature on this issue, any future directions and interpretation updates will be reflected in the following financial statements, according to modalities envisaged from time to time by the reference standards. These consolidated financial statements are expressed in Euro and, in compliance with IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” include the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated income statement and the consolidated comprehensive income statement, the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related Explanatory Notes. The principles utilised are the same as those used for the preparation of the last annual financial statements and were applied evenly, except for the accounting standard “IFRS 16—Leases”, applied from 1 January 2019. In the current year, the Group has applied IFRS 16 (as issued by the IASB in January 2016) that is effective for annual periods that begin on or after 1 January 2019. The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, with no restatement of the comparative information. Equity was not impacted as the right of use asset was measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, please refer to Note 4.29. IFRS 16 provides a new definition of lease and introduces a criterion based on the notion of control (right of use) of a good in order to distinguish leasing contracts from service contracts while identifying the following as discriminating factors of leases: identification of the good, the right of replacement of the latter, the right to substantially obtain all the economic benefits deriving from the use of the good and lastly, the right to manage the use of the good underlying the contract. IFRS 16 introduces significant changes to lessee accounting by removing the distinction between operating and finance lease and requiring the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at commencement for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets. In contrast to lessee accounting, the standard does not include significant changes for lessors. For a description of the impacts resulting from the application of the above standard, please refer to Note 4. The consolidation was carried out under the line-by-line method, including the non-controlling interests reported in the relevant shareholders’ equity and income statement accounts. The Group companies adopted the same accounting period as the Parent Company and the standards utilised are the same for the preparation as the last annual financial statements and were applied in a uniform manner. In the statement of financial position, assets and liabilities are classified according to the “current/noncurrent” criterion with separation of assets and liabilities held-for-sale. Current assets are those held for sale or used in the normal business operating cycle or in the twelve months following the year-end. Current liabilities are expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle or within 12 months following the year-end. The income statement is classified according to the nature of the costs while the cash flow statement uses the direct method.

Specifically, for real estate, this evaluation considered the specific facts and circumstances of each activity.

Control is defined as the ability to directly or indirectly determine the financial and management policies and benefit from their implementation.

The accounts are consolidated under the line-by-line method, therefore including the entire amount of assets and liabilities and all costs and revenues regardless of the percentage of share capital held. The book value of consolidated investments is therefore derecognised against the relative shareholders’ equity. The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition until the date of sale. The operations, the balances as well as the unrealised profits and losses on inter-group transactions are derecognised.

The estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the reporting date and on prior experience where the book value of assets and liabilities is not easily inferable from other sources. However, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions periodically revised and changes are immediately reflected in the income statement. The items that are mostly influenced by estimates are the calculation of amortisation/depreciation, impairment tests on assets (including measurement of receivables), provisions for allocations, employee benefits, fair value of financial liabilities, deferred tax assets and liabilities and customer contracts assets. For a better understanding of the financial statements, the main estimates utilised in the drawing up of the financial statements are shown hereunder and involve the use of subjective opinions, assumptions and estimates related to issues that are uncertain by nature. The changes in conditions underlying the opinions and assumptions might have a significant impact on the following financial years. _Impairment of assets (Goodwill Euro 108 million and Trademark Euro 453 million)_ As explained in more detail in paragraph 7 hereof, for the calculation of the value in use of Cash Generating Units, the Group has taken into account, with reference to the specified period, the expected trends resulting from the budget for 2019 and, for subsequent years, the forecasts included in the 2020—2022 multi-year plan. The impairment test carried out on the basis of these forecasts did not generate any write-downs. _Purchase Price Allocation (IFRS 3)_ As explained in the paragraph “Completing the accounting activities related to acquisitions”, the recognition of business combination transactions implies the allocation of the payment of acquisition to the assets and liabilities of the acquired company, which are evaluated at fair value. The possible difference, if positive, is recorded as goodwill; if negative, it is recorded in the income statement. In the process of assigning amounts to certain asset items, the Group applied estimates to determine their fair value. To determine fair value, the Group used valuation methods, including discounted cash flow analysis. To calculate the present value of future cash flows, it is necessary to formulate some assumptions regarding uncertain issues, including management’s expectations regarding: - marginality of customer portfolios; - the probability of renewal of contracts with customers; - the selection of the discount rate that reflects the risk. The Group’s estimates are based on assumptions deemed reasonable, but uncertain and foreseeable. These assessments require the use of management assumptions, which may not reflect unpredictable events. _Deferred tax assets_ The recoverability of deferred tax assets is subject to the achievement of sufficiently large future taxable profits for the absorption of the aforementioned tax losses or to the competition of the deferred taxation F-69 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Expenses for substantial updating of products are capitalised as improvements and added to the original cost of the software. Development costs that improve product performance or upgrade the product to regulatory requirements are reflected in projects created for customers and are thus expensed during the financial year in which they are incurred.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise: - fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; - variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date; - the amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; - the exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position. The liability is subsequently restated to take account of any new valuations or changes in the lease or revision of substantially fixed payments, it is reduced as a result of payments and is increased to reflect interest. Variable payments that do not depend on indices or rates and are therefore not reflected in the liability relating to the lease contract must be recorded in the income statement when the instalment is paid. The Group restates the value of the lease liabilities (and adjusts the value of the corresponding right of use) if there is: - a change in the duration of the lease or there is a change in the assessment of the exercise of the option right; in this case, the lease liability is recalculated by discounting the new lease payments at the revised discount rate; - a change in the value of the lease payments following changes in the indices or rates, in such cases the lease liability is recalculated by discounting the new lease payments at the initial discount rate (unless the payments due under the leases change as a result of interest rate fluctuations, in which case a revised discount rate must be used); - a lease agreement has been modified and the modification is not included in the case studies for the separate recognition of the lease agreement. In such cases, the lease liability is recalculated by discounting the new lease payments at the revised interest rate. The Group did not detect any of the aforementioned changes in the period. The right of use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day, less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The right of use is depreciated on a systematic basis over the term of the lease contract. If the lease provides for the transfer of ownership or a redemption option whose exercise is considered reasonably certain at the end of the contract, the right of use is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.

Where the effect of the current amount of the payment is significant, the amount of the provision is represented by the value of resources considered necessary to satisfy the obligation on maturity discounted at a nominal rate without risks. The contingent assets and liabilities (possible assets and liabilities or not recorded as the amount may not be reliably estimated) are not recorded in the financial statements. Information in this regard is provided however. Contract terms typically range from 1 to 2 years. Contract prices might be subject to incentives and penalties, based on achievement of specified performance targets or level of benefits delivered to the customer. For deliverable-based contracts, revenue is generally recognized over time, because at least one of the following conditions is met: (i) the Group’s performance enhances or creates an asset that the customer controls as the Group performs; or (ii) the Group builds an asset that has no alternative use (e.g. it is customer-specific) and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance to date in case of termination by the customer. The Group applies the “cost-to-cost” method to measure progress to completion. The percentage of completion is based on costs incurred to date relative to the total estimate of cost at completion of the contract. Estimates of total contract costs are revised when new elements arise and changes in estimates and related percentage of completion are recorded in the income statement. The related costs on deliverable-based contracts are expensed as incurred. The Group earns contractually the right to bill upon achievement of specified milestones or upon customer acceptance of work performed. The difference between the revenue recognized and the billing already carried out to certify the progress of the work is recorded as “Contract assets”. Any up-front fees (non-refundable) received are recognized over the duration of the service. _Resource-based contracts_ This type of contracts generally includes IT consultancy or operational activities on IT systems. Revenue from Resource-based contracts is recognized based on working hours (or days spent) finalized for the fulfillment of the service. Each performance obligation is satisfied over time as the client continuously receives and consumes the benefits of the services. The services are priced based on the number of working hours/working days spent on the contract. The amount to be billed is representative of the value of the service delivered to the customer and therefore, applying the right-to-bill practical expedient, revenue is recognized over time based on the working hours spent/working days valued on the basis of defined prices. _Service-based contracts_ The Group supplies goods (e.g. software) and services (e.g. installation, tax collection etc.) to customers. These revenues are recognised at a point in time, when the control of the goods have passed to the customer and when all the benefits deriving from the performance have been transferred to the customer. In particular, as far as Public Administration and tax collection are concerned, the revenue is recognized when the evidence of the collection has been provided (e.g. tax has been paid by the tax payer). The direct costs charged to the tax collection activity which are considered recoverable through the fees that are reasonably expected to be collected over the duration of the contract are recognized, up to the moment the obligation is fulfilled, among the “Deferred contractual costs”. Any up-front fees (non-refundable) received are recognized over the duration of the service. _Assistance and maintenance based contracts_ This type of contract generally includes assistance and maintenance services, cloud services, and licensing. Each performance obligation is satisfied over time as the client continuously receives and consumes the benefits of the services. F-85 ----- The amount to be invoiced is representative of the service provided monthly/quarterly to the customer. Any up-front fees (non-refundable) received are recognized over the duration of the service. In addition, the need to assess the probability of obtaining/collecting the economic benefits linked to the income is highlighted, as regards the recognition of revenues. As regards the customer contract assets (i.e. contractual activities), the requirement to proceed with the recognition of revenues is introduced, also taking into account any discounting effect deriving from over time collections, as explained in the Note 13. _Costs_ Interest is recorded at the effective rate based on the accruals principle. Costs relating to the acquisition of new knowledge or discoveries, to the study of alternative products or processes, of new techniques or models, to the design and construction of prototypes or incurred for other scientific research activities or technological development are generally considered current costs and recorded to the income statement in the year in which they are incurred. These costs are almost entirely attributable to personnel costs. _Dividends_ Dividends are recognised at the date of endorsement of the resolution by the Shareholders’ Meeting, unless the sale of shares is reasonably certain before the coupon detachment date.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The exposure to interest rate risk arises from the need to finance operations and M&A investments and using available liquidity. Fluctuations in market interest rates can have a negative or positive impact on the Group’s economic result, indirectly influencing the costs and returns of financing and investment transactions. The interest rate risk to which the Group is exposed derives from bank loans.

The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on investments in debt instruments that are measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI, lease receivables, trade receivables and contract assets, as well as on financial guarantee contracts. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.

The method used to estimate the value of the trademark was chosen by taking account of the purposes of the transaction and the features of the trademark. In particular, in line with the literature and the best professional practice, the value of the trademark owned by Engineering was determined by using the income-based method, based on the discounting of future benefits attributable to the asset subject to value appraisal. The trademark is a right, which is legally protected through the registration at the competent Authorities. By reason of the fact that this right has no legal, contract, competitive or economic term which limits its useful life, the same is classified as an indefinite life intangible asset and therefore it is not amortised but it is subject to impairment loss when tested for impairment, as provided for by IAS 36. The impairment test carried out as of 31 December 2019 had confirmed that there was no need to write down the value of the trademark with an indefinite useful life expressed in the consolidated financial statements. The “Other assets” item mainly consists of the “Contract Portfolio” and the “Customer Relation Value” recorded as a result of the business combination carried out by Engineering in previous years. During the period, “Other fixed assets” recorded an overall increase of Euro 8.3 million, mainly due to the identification and F-97 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The analysis was performed to determine the goodwill recoverable value, which was allocated to Cash Generating Units (CGUs) to which it is related. CGU is defined as an asset or small group of assets that generate incoming cash flows that are widely independent from the incoming cash flows resulting from other assets or group of assets. The CGUs were determined based on the market segments and the single operating investees, consistently with the corporate management view in terms of monitoring of results and economic planning. The impairment test carried out as of 31 December 2019 on the goodwill allocated to the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) to which it relates confirmed that there is no need to write-downs the value disclosed in the financial statements. Based on the impairment test carried out according to the requirements of IAS 36 and IFRS 3 and to the methods described above and according to special modalities described hereunder, the aggregate value of the goodwill tested for impairment was deemed as adequately supported in terms of expected economic results and related cash flows.

These costs are realised in the normal operating cycle. The Group has also recorded contract costs in relation to the fulfilment of the contract for Euro 14,159 thousand. These are direct costs charged to orders, which include the purchase of materials from third parties, outside labour and the cost of employees. The portions of cost released pertaining to 2019, determined on the basis of the ratio between the revenues accrued for the activities carried out at the reporting date and the total estimated revenues until the end of the contracts, amount to Euro 498 thousand for the so-called transition costs and start-up costs and Euro 16,348 thousand for the costs for the fulfilment of the contract.

In order to determine the expected credit loss, trade receivables were initially grouped by counterparty (third parties and Public Administration) and subsequently, for receivables from third parties only, by days past due. Customer contract assets refer to invoices to be issued for contracts in progress, and have substantially the same risk characteristics as trade receivables for the same type of contracts. The Group has therefore concluded that the expected credit loss for trade receivables represents a reasonable approximation of the losses on customer contract assets. The expected credit loss rates are based on the collection times over a period of 545 days prior to 1 January 2018, and the corresponding losses on historical receivables during that period. Historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and future macroeconomic conditions affecting customers’ ability to repay loans. The Company has identified the average default rate of Italian companies for the two-year period 2018-2019 as a relevant factor for receivables from third parties, while it has identified the country risk of Italy as the main factor for receivables from the Public Administration. These factors were used to adjust the historical loss rates recorded. On this basis, the doubtful debt provision to be subject to collective impairment as of 1 January 2018, was determined as follows. It should be noted that, on the basis of the model described above, there are no significant impacts such as to have to adjust the doubtful debt provision as of 31 December 2019, with reference to the expected credit loss.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The transfer was non-recourse, so risks and benefits related to receivables were transferred to the transferee; receivables were therefore written off from the assets in the consolidated statement of financial position, according to the consideration received by factoring companies. Receivables include the exposure as of 31 December 2019, with respect to Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. equal to Euro 107,873,475 (including the related doubtful debt provision amounting to Euro 27,377,522), of which Euro 14,526,757 of customer contract assets, were related to the IT activities connected with the building of an integrated IT platform for the Sicilian Region within specifications and provisions set out in the convention signed between the Sicilian Region, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. (former Sicilia e-Servizi S.p.A.) and Sicilia e-Servizi Venture S.c.r.l. in liquidation on 21 May 2007 and expired on 22 December 2013. In order to obtain payment of the sums due, in the mutual interest, on 9 October 2012 SISEV, the Sicilian Region and Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. signed an “Agreement” which regulated the repayment of SISEV receivables, indicating the final repayment date on 31 December 2013. Moreover, this agreement outlined that the Sicilian Region was undertaking to carry out controls and provide Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. with all the technical and economic means, so as the latter would have been able to correctly fulfil its obligations, and envisaged that, while executing the agreement, such obligations would have been undertaken by SISEV.

Given the non payments of Sicilia Digitale S.p.A., on 26 June 2013, SISEV filed a petition for an order of payment before the Court of Palermo against Sicilia Digitale S.p.A., and obtained the payment order for Euro 30,052 thousand (in addition to interests, expenses and remunerations, VAT and CPA), for which, however, no execution order was given. Therefore, to safeguard its rights, on 18 July 2014 SISEV applied for a distraint order over all receivables from the Sicilian Region to Sicilia Digitale S.p.A., up to the entire amounts receivable accrued by the company. On 10 November 2014, the Court of Palermo rejected SISEV’s request while underlying that “given that, besides Sicilia e-Servizi S.p.A., also the Sicilian Region (via its accountant general), an undoubtedly solvent entity, is directly committed with respect to Sicilia e-Servizi Venture S.c.r.l. - ... Omitted ... there is no urgency (periculum in mora) ...”. In other words, the Judge reported no credit risk, while highlighting the “guarantor” role played by the Sicilian Region in favour of SISEV. As regards Sicilia Digitale S.p.A.’s judgement of opposition to the first order decree, deposited on 3 September 2013, obtained in the amount of approximately Euro 30,052 thousand, the Judge ordered Office Technical Experts, to evaluate, inter alia, the actual services rendered by SISEV, which are related to the invoicing subject to the order of payment. On 17 December 2016, the Office Technical Experts, designated for the assessment of the actual performance by Venture of services that are related to the invoicing object of the payment order, transmitted to the parties a first draft of the expertise where a total amount receivable of Euro 28,068 thousand was assessed in favour of Venture; therefore, almost the entire amount claimed in Court was assessed by experts (taking account that in the arrears some payments were received by Venture and today the receivables in question were equal to Euro 28,346 thousand). Following a request of integration by the Judge, the experts therefore issued and lodged the supplementary expertise (in which the assets involved in the payment claim were divided according to the existence or non-existence of approvals by the management of Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and/or the Region). After filing the supplementary expertise report, following the clarification of the conclusions of the parties involved, with a sentence dated 30 August 2018, the Judge ordered, among other things, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. to pay SISEV Euro 19,508 thousand, plus interest at the rate indicated in the payment order. The Judge therefore confirmed the evaluations expressed by the experts, in the aforementioned supplementary expertise report, considering that only the services certified by SISEV’s managerial figures were “recognised” by SISEV. By a writ of summons on appeal notified on 18 February 2019, Sicilia Digitale appealed against the aforementioned judgment, asking for its complete reform. SISEV appeared with a cross-appeal response asking for recognition of the amounts not included in the Court’s sentence. At the first hearing on 31 May 2019, SISEV requested, in agreement with Sicilia Digitale, postponement for negotiations, granted until 5 July 2019. In fact, on 12 June 2019, a specific transaction was agreed between the transferees of the SISEV credit (Engineering and Accenture, as creditor partners for services rendered and not remunerated at that time) and Sicilia Digitale for the recognition to them of a total amount of Euro 19.5 million (of which Euro 13.2 million in favour of Engineering and Euro 6.3 million in favour of Accenture), with waiver of the interest on arrears and which specifies, among other things, a plan for the repayment of the credit transacted gave the last forecast data expected on 1 May 2020. In addition, the transaction provides that the failure to comply with any time scans for the payment so agreed is provided, for the express provision of the agreement, the resolution of it and the possibility for the creditor parties (Engineering and Accenture) to act for the entire. In the illustrated context, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. has only partially complied with the credit repayment plan contained in the transaction; in fact, it should be noted that so far the amounts provided for by the same writing have not been paid since November 2019. For this reason, a special notice was sent on 3 February 2020 to fulfillment under penalty of termination of the transaction. However, to date, no further payment has been received, in so that it is being considered to proceed with the dissolution of the settlement agreement and the enforcement of the judgement for the hiegher amount indicated therein. In addition to what has just been illustrated, on 18 February 2016, SISEV sent a writ of summons to obtain the payment of the entire amount of receivables (around Euro 79,675 thousand, including the works recognised in the financial statements to complete the amount already requested with an appeal for an order of payment) as F-109 ----- the company deems, as already stated, that these amounts were correctly originated and are correctly payable, also pursuant to provisions contained in the trilateral agreement signed on 9 October 2012 by the Sicilian Region, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and SISEV. Both parties, i.e. the Sicilian Region and Sicilia Digitale S.p.A., appeared and filed objections including, but not limited to, the fact that the measure dated 9 October 2012 was invalid, the service contracts and related orders were null and void and Venture unfulfilled its know-how transfer obligations. The parties also filed a claim for damages for a total amount of Euro 95,643 thousand. These plaintiff’s claims were objected at the first hearing of 8 June 2016. After filing the pre-trial briefs, the Judge reserved on the ruling of all claims submitted, including but not limited to, evidence by SISEV based on documents and expertises. On 30 May 2018, the technical experts appointed by the Court of Palermo sent the parties and their respective technical experts a draft of the expertise. Given the extent of this report, the Judge was first asked to extend the deadline for replies to the expertise; for this reason, the Judge granted the extension as a request and assigned the parties a deadline until 30 September 2018, to communicate their observations to the expertise, assigning the experts a further deadline until 30 October 2018, to file the final report together with the observations of the parties and setting a hearing on 8 November 2018, for the continuation of the case. The aforementioned final report shows (i) a receivable assessed by SISEV for only Euro 4,198 thousand against a claim of Euro 79,675 thousand and (ii) provides the Judge, as a possible alternative assessment criterion, with a second calculation certifying a total receivable of Euro 26,157 thousand from Venture. The case was adjourned to the hearing of 12 December 2019, for examination by the expertise. Considering the report to be seriously omissive and erroneous, a new request for the renewal of the expertise, pursuant to Article 196 of the Italian Criminal Code, was submitted. It was discussed at the hearing of 30 May 2019, at which the Region and Sicilia Digitale contested the application and asked for its complete rejection. The Judge deferred decision and, as a result, rejected the application for renewal, deducing, as to form, the absence of any breach by the independent expert of the right to be heard and, on the merits, the possibility of detecting any errors in the expert’s report in the decision-making process. At the hearing of 19 December 2019, to which the case was then adjourned, the same was held in judgment. The final briefs are currently being drafted. Please note that, in addition to the above, no specific critical issues or formal claims related to the correct execution of services and good quality of products delivered by SISEV were highlighted by Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and/or the Sicilian Region. Moreover, the above-mentioned claims do not seem prima facie suited to stop the aggregate claims of SISEV. To date, it is therefore deemed that the defence of the summoned parties are not such to affect the evaluation on the collectability of receivables in favour of SISEV. The Directors, considering the legitimacy of the credit lines carried out and the correct execution of the services, assessed the appraisal delivered by the Office Technical Experts as part of the summons to obtain payment of an amount of their receivables equal to approximately Euro 79,675 thousand, as seriously omissive and erroneous consider the receivable from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. to SISEV to be collectable. In any case, considering the continuous change in institutional interlocutors and the difficulty in achieving an amicable agreement, in view of a legal dispute and the objections filed by Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and the Sicilian Region, in its consolidated financial statements the Group recognised the interest set out by law pertaining to the period considered (around Euro 5.0 million) in the income statement and under financial income, in addition to the amount already recognised until 31 December 2018 (for a total amount of around Euro 35.3 million), and accrued a bed debt provision for Euro 26.8 million, in addition of the previous accruals, for a total doubtful debt provision of approximately Euro 62.7 million, which includes the total impairment of the statutory interest shown above and recognised in the financial statements and, for the remaining portion, the impairment of the nominal value of the receivable. The Directors have explained that this determination is the result of a prognostic judgement formulated on the basis of a careful reflection of all existing available information.

The financial parameters are revised twice a year with reference to the consolidated financial statements and the consolidated half-year report. All parameters envisaged in the contracts have been fulfilled. As regards the instalment of Euro 31.5 million supplied by Banca Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., the rate swap contract was confirmed to hedge against rate fluctuations, which was entered into on 1 July 2014, with Unicredit S.p.A., to hedge the loan supplied by the same bank on behalf of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and redeemed on 30 December 2015. This changes the variable portion of the rate, 3-month Euribor, 360 days, into a fixed rate equal to 0.56% for the entire duration of the loan instalment redemption. This hedging will expire in March 2020 at the same time as the last repayment instalment of the Banca Intesa loan. As regards the loan granted by Banca IMI S.p.A./Pool of Banks on 23 July 2017, a contract was signed to hedge interest rate oscillation, as provided by the Contract and by the Hedging Strategy Letter. The hedging, a Cap Rate set at 0.15% expired on 21 October 2019 and was never activated.

Post-employment benefits, accrued after 1 January 2007, represent a “defined contribution plan”. Periodically, the Company pays post-employment benefits accrued to a separate entity (e.g. INPS and/or a Fund) with the payment fulfilling obligations toward employees. For accounting purposes, it is included under other contributions, therefore the post-employment benefit matured is recorded as a cost in the period with the payable recognised under short-term payables. Post-employment benefits accrued up to 31 December 2006 continue to represent a “defined benefit plan” which is more certain in terms of their existence and sum, but uncertain in terms of manifestation. The total amount of the benefit obligation is calculated and certified on an annual basis by an independent actuary by using the “Projected Unit Credit” method. A summary of the actuarial assumptions adopted in measuring post-employment benefits is provided below. Financial assumptions: - future annual rates of inflation were set according to the average rates of inflation in Italy in recent years, based on ISTAT data; - future annual revaluation rates of existing provisions and subsequent payments fixed, as established by regulations at 75% of the inflation rate plus 1.50% net of taxes; - the annual discount rate was established as variable from 0.0000% to 0.6997% and was deducted adopting a rate curve combining the effective yield rates movements of the Euro Bonds of primary companies with AA rating or higher. Demographic assumptions: - to evaluate length of employment with the Company, the “Tavola di permanenza nella posizione di attivo” RG48 (a table for company service length prepared by the Italian Treasury Department based on data for those born in 1948) was used, selected, projected and separated by gender, supplemented with the probability of additional reasons for departure (resignations, advances which are a financialbased cause for leaving, measurable in terms of cancellation probability, and other). The following table show the absolute and relative changes in liabilities measured according to IAS 19 (DBO), while assuming a 10% negative or positive change in the revaluation and/or discounting rates.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The subsidiary recognised, instead, a cost of equal amount. During the year, 10,668 options were assigned to the beneficiaries of the Stock Options Plan, while the number of options that lapsed was (3,191). The options become exercisable if certain time and performance objectives are achieved (so-called “vested options”). In particular, the time target is achieved—according to the regulation scheme—pro-rata temporis over the period December 2017—December 2020. The options vested can be exercised (i) starting from the plan expiration notice and no later than the working day prior to the plan expiry date and (ii) upon the occurrence of a divestment at any time without any expiry condition. The exercise of vested shares is permitted, without losing any vested rights, even to the so-called “good leaver” beneficiary who has terminated his employment relationship. If the so-called “good leaver” beneficiary ceases during the period December 2017—December 2020, the same will be entitled to a pro-rata temporis of options to be exercised. In the event that the divestment took place before December 2020, the options would all be considered 100% vested. At 31 December 2019 there was not any accelerating event. The fair value of rights assigned is calculated, upon assignment, by using the binomial model to evaluate US options (so-called Cox, Ross and Rubinstein model). In particular, the main input data used to measure the fair value of the Stock Option Plan is summarised as follows: - multiple of EV/EBITDA, determined as mean of a panel of listed comparable values; - interest rate curve (IRS 3 years) as of 31 December 2017; - historical volatility (at 260 days), observed as of 31 December 2017; - dividend yield equal to zero for the Stock Option measurement; - historical series of logarithmic yields for the securities involved; - liquidity discount equal to 20%; - strike price equal to Euro 42.15, contractually determined. The fair value of options granted in the first pool amounted to Euro 43.30 per option. The fair value at the assignment date was determined independently and based on the following parameters for the options granted: - options are granted free; - options accrued are exercisable; - the exercise price is Euro 0; - the concession time is 3.5 years; - the exercise price for each share at the assignment date is Euro 42.15.

On the basis of the data used for fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy is identified on the basis of which assets and liabilities measured at fair value or for which fair value is indicated in the financial statement disclosures are classified: a) level 1: includes prices quoted in active markets for assets or liabilities identical to those being valued; b) level 2: includes observable data, different from those included in level 1, such as: (i) prices quoted in active markets for similar or identical assets or liabilities; (ii) prices quoted in non-active markets for similar or identical assets or liabilities; (iii) other observable data (interest rate curves, implicit volatilities, credit spreads); c) level 3: uses non-observable data, which may be used if no observable input data is available. The non-observable data used for fair value measurement purposes reflects the assumptions that market participants would make when pricing the assets and liabilities being measured. Please refer to the table below for the definition of the fair value hierarchy level on the basis of which the individual instruments measured at fair value have been classified. No transfers between the different levels of the fair value hierarchy took place during the year. The fair value of derivative instruments is determined by discounting expected cash flows to present value, using the market interest rate curve at the reference date and the listed credit default swap curve of the counterparty and Group companies, to include the non-performance risk explicitly provided for by IFRS 13. For medium/long-term financial instruments, other than derivative instruments, where market prices are not available, the fair value is determined by discounting expected cash flows, using the market interest rate curve at the reference date and considering the counterparty risk in the case of financial assets and its credit risk in the case of financial liabilities.

Companies with little or no digitization are currently at a standstill. However, it should be noted that in all markets, core processes of big companies did not stop completely. This, for the Group, which developed its core activities with big companies, suggests a continuing solid business. From Digital Workplace to collaboration tools, all of our customers are asking us to increase digital capabilities or take the first steps of digital transformation quickly. By digitizing the business, they also increase awareness of the importance of Cybersecurity to protect the digitalization of business. Our remote maintenance tools are receiving additional boosts of demand as it is impossible for many experienced maintainers to be present onsite. In these weeks, we have all witnessed the ramp up of digital expenses and the difficulties in managing the increase in demand. Last year we acquired a start up with a cutting-edge e-commerce proposal, whose first data is very promising. Finally, our data management platforms are currently active in the territory to allow those who are fighting this virus to make better decisions, in less time, based on data. _Focus on contractual obligations_ With the adoption of the Containment Measures, while increasing the potential risk that the obligations undertaken may not be carried out within the contractual terms or not completely fulfilled, the Group considers it highly unlikely that this risk will actually materialize. This assessment is based both on the instruction contained in the Italian Civil Code on the subject of excessive onerousness and impossibility of performance and on interpretative practices regarding force majeure events. In fact, a party may not be held liable for its failure to perform (i) if the contractually envisaged service becomes excessively onerous due to the occurrence of “extraordinary or unforeseeable events” and/or (ii) if the failure or delay in performance is due to the impossibility of performance not attributable to it, the party shall not be held liable for any such failure or delay. In this sense, it seems useful to underline Article 79 of DL 18/20 which, although with reference to the aviation sector, has recognized “(omissis) the Covid-19 epidemic is formally recognized as a natural disaster and exceptional event (omissis)”. _Group financial position and liquidity_ There may be a slowdown in cash collections from certain customers, who may be impacted more significantly by the Covid-19 emergency, compared to what was expected. In any case, the diversification of the sectors in which the Group’s customers operate (Public Administration, Finance, Healthcare, Industry, Transportation, Telco & Media, Energy & Utilities) and the good financial condition, the availability of liquidity and credit lines already approved, are elements mitigating the potential financial and liquidity risk. Moreover, even in a context of general uncertainty related to the effects of Covid-19 at the current time the Directors did not identify critical elements to compromise the compliance with the covenants illustrated in Note 22 to the Explanatory Notes in future years. In particular, the level of available liquidity should enable the Group to face the coming months, albeit in a context of uncertainty, without recourse to additional sources of funding. The potential effects on the consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2020 are not determinable and will be subject to constant monitoring throughout the year. However, at the current stage of the Covid-19 context, the scenarios of medium-long term of the Group did not detect clear risks of impairment of the values recorded in the financial statements as at 31 December 2019. _Sensitivity Analysis_ The Group, considering the impact of Covid-19, performed a series of quantitative and qualitative analyses to substantiate the risks connected to the current scenario. In particular, in the various estimation processes related to the valuation of recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives the Group developed sensitivity analysis with the purpose of identifying the value of the key parameters where the recoverable amount matches the book value.

The interruptions are noticeable in some sectors such as tourism, hospitality, transport, retail sales and entertainment, while in other sectors such as manufacturing there are some chain effects. The financial markets have suffered immediate effects. The coronavirus epidemic occurred in China in December 2019 and continued to evolve gradually. On 30 January 2020, the WHO International Emergency Standards Committee declared the epidemic a “public health emergency of international concern”. Since then, more cases have been diagnosed, including in other countries. In Italy, the pandemic initially affected the Northern regions and subsequently spread to the rest of the country. The Italian Government issued several decrees of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, which have introduced increasingly restrictive measures for commercial activities and social aggregation in order to contain the risk of contagion. In this context, preceding the decree of the Italian Government, which came into force on 23 March 2020, and temporarily suspended all non-essential production activities, the Group has progressively limited activities to customers and/or operating offices being able to work in smart working. Indeed, the use of cloud systems and advanced individual productivity systems have allowed a rapid reconfiguration of activities in smart working mode ensuring the safety of the Group’s employees and the continuation of the activities contracted with customers. In addition, Engineering as part of its activities is able to manage remotely the workstations of customers turning them into a “Digital Workplace”; this technology helps and supports the new way of working required in the current scenario. To protect the health of its employees, the Engineering Group has issued a series of stringent orders, such as the limitation of travel and access to offices, to consultants and suppliers as well, methods of conducting meetings in compliance with the decrees, internal communication methods through timely circulation of Covid-19 press releases. For the purposes of preparing these consolidated financial statement as of 31 December 2019, the events connected to Covid-19 constitute a “non-adjusting event” of the economic and financial results and therefore the information required pursuant to IAS 10—Events after the Reporting Period has been provided. Given the inherent uncertainties, it is not practicable at this time to provide a quantitative estimate of the impact of the current pandemic on the Group. _Business scenarios and implemented operations_ In the current complex market situation we are focused on supporting our clients, the Italian Government and in particular the Italian healthcare sector, in order to best meet their needs. We believe that potential impacts will manifest in the Transportation, Retail and some areas related to manufacturing. In this context, all sectors are increasing demands for digitization, from workplace to remote maintenance, as well as using data management platforms to facilitate decisions. The topic of digital transformation was already on the policy actions list for many organizations.

As a consequence, as from July 1, 2018, all companies operating in Argentina are bound to apply the IAS 29 “Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary economies” to their financial reporting. With reference to the Group, the consolidated financial results as of December 31, 2018 included the effects resulting from the application of the above-mentioned accounting standard, with effect as from January 1, 2018. The Group disclosed the consolidated financial figures in Euro and no redetermination of amounts disclosed in 2017 was required. Consistently with provisions set out by the IAS 29, the redetermination of the financial statements amounts generally entailed the following: - as regards the income statement, costs and revenues were written up by applying the change in the general consumer price index, in order to reflect the loss of purchasing power of the local currency as of December 31, 2018. For the purposes of the conversion in Euro of the income statement, redetermined in this way, the punctual change as of December 31, 2018 was consistently applied instead of the average exchange rate for the period. With reference to net consolidated sales for the year, the effect resulting from the application of the standard led to a negative change of Euro 247.2 thousand for 2018; - as regards the statement of financial position, the monetary elements were not redetermined insomuch as they were already expressed in the current measurement unit at year end. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are instead written-up to reflect the loss of the purchase power of local currency from the date in which assets and liabilities were initially recorded until year end; - the effect determined on the net monetary position, for the portion generated over the twelve months of 2018 (total income of Euro 302.9 thousand) was charged to the income statement, under net financial income (charges), while the effects of the first-time application of the standard, as of January 1, 2018, were recorded directly as shareholders’ equity components.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

These consolidated financial statements are expressed in Euro and, in compliance with IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” include the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated income statement and the consolidated comprehensive income statement, the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related Explanatory Notes. The standards utilised are the same as those used for the preparation of the last annual financial statements and were applied evenly, except for “IFRS 9—Financial Instruments” and “IFRS 15—Revenues from contracts with customers”, as well as other accounting standards, amendments and interpretations applicable for accounting periods beginning on January 1, 2018, as indicated in paragraph 4.29. Pursuant to the IFRS 9— Financial Instruments and IFRS 15—Revenues from contracts with customers, the Group opted to disclose the effect, related to the retroactive remeasurement of amounts, in shareholders’ equity on January 1, 2018, without remeasuring the balance of items of compared previous years. For further details on the impact resulting from the application of these standards, reference is made to the following Note 4.29. The consolidation was carried out under the line-by-line method, including the non-controlling interests reported in the relevant shareholders’ equity and income statement accounts. The Group companies adopted the same accounting period as the Parent Company and the standards utilised are the same for the preparation as the last annual financial statements and were applied in a uniform manner. In the statement of financial position, assets and liabilities are classified according to the “current/ non-current” criterion with separation of assets and liabilities held-for-sale. Current assets are those held for sale or used in the normal business operating cycle or in the twelve months following the year-end. Current liabilities are expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle or within 12 months following the year-end. The income statement is classified according to the nature of the costs while the cash flow statement uses the direct method. The transactions with related parties concern subsidiaries, associates and Directors and Executives with strategic responsibilities. The financial statements are accompanied by the Directors’ Report prepared by the Board of Directors in compliance with Article 2428 of the Italian Civil Code, which contains more detailed information on Group operations and significant events after the year-end. For each item of the statements, the corresponding figure of the previous year is disclosed for comparison purposes. These comparative figures were restated, with respect to those already disclosed in the financial statements ended December 31, 2017, only for items recognised within the completion process of accounting activities connected to the acquisition of control of acquired companies (as provided for by IFRS 3), as more widely shown in paragraph 1.2 of these Explanatory Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Goodwill from the acquisition of companies for payment is not amortised and is subject to an impairment test at least once a year. For this purpose, goodwill is allocated to one or more Cash Generating Units. Potential reductions in value emerging from the impairment test are not reversed in subsequent periods. In the case of the sale of assets (or part of an asset) of a CGU, any goodwill associated is included in the book value of the asset in order to determine the profit or loss from sale in proportion to the value of the CGU sold. Goodwill relating to associates or other companies is included in the book value of these companies. At period-end, goodwill is subject to impairment testing and adjusted for any losses. Losses are booked directly to the income statement. For this purpose and in line with acquisitions of previous years, the different Cash Generating Units have been identified, which respect the independence criteria in the organisational structure and the independent capacity to generate cash flow, and are then measured using impairment testing. A current value is determined for the relevant asset using a Discounted Cash Flow Model (DCF) based on the end of year account situation for each CGU. The current value is compared with the net book value and goodwill recorded in the financial statements to determine whether it is necessary to write-down the investment and record a loss in the financial statements.

It may also involve the acquisition by an entity of share capital of another entity, acquisition of the net assets of another entity, undertaking of the liabilities of another entity or the acquisition of part of the net assets of another entity which, combined, establish one or more company activities. The combination may be realised through issue of instruments representing share capital, the transfer of cash or other liquid assets or other assets, or by a combination of the above.

It may entail the incorporation of a new entity that controls the entities taking part in the combination or net assets transferred or the restructuring of one or more of the participating entities. The business combinations are recorded under the acquisition method. This method considers that the acquisition price must be reflected in the value of the assets of the entity acquired and this allocation must be at fair value (of the assets and of the liabilities) and not at their book value.

They are therefore initially recorded at fair value, adjusted with directly attributable transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost based on the effective interest rate method (i.e. the rate that equalizes, upon initial recognition, the current value of expected cash flows and the book value) and adequately adjusted to take account of any possible write-downs, through the creation of a bad debt provision. Trade receivables are included in current assets, except for amounts that are overdue after one year with respect to the reporting date. These receivables are disclosed under non-current assets. At each reporting date, financial assets, except for those measured at fair value with a contra-entry recognised in the income statement, are analysed to assess the existence of any possible impairment indicators. IFRS 9 requires the application of a model based on expected losses on receivables. The Group applies the simplified approach to estimate the expected losses along the receivable useful life and takes account of its historical experience of losses on receivables, adjusted to reflect the current conditions and estimates on future economic conditions. The model of expected losses on receivables requires the immediate recognition of expected losses during the useful life of the receivable, as the occurrence of a trigger event is not required to recognise losses. For trade receivables accounted with the criterion of amortised cost, after identifying an impairment, its value is measured as the difference between the book value of the asset and the current value of the expected future cash flows, discounted on the basis of the original effective interest rate. This value is recognised in the income statement. Receivables factored through non-recourse factoring transactions, according to which the final transfer to the transferee was carried out in relation to risks and benefits of factored receivables, were written off from the financial statements upon their transfer.

The hedge was created through agreeing an interest rate swap contract, against which the Company receives an indexed variable interest rate and expiry and time periods in line with the hedged loan and paying a fixed interest rate. The efficacy, measured periodically, is verified with the perfect hedge derivative method. Changes in the fair value of the derivative are calculated based on the methods utilised for prospective or retrospective assessment of efficacy in the hedging report and are compared with the changes in the fair value of a similar derivative instrument. The hedging is deemed as effective in relation to the application of a quality measurement of the economic relation between the hedged element and the hedging element. The effective hedging component is recorded under other comprehensive income statement items and shareholders’ equity reserve and is calculated as the lower value between the accumulated changes in hedge derivative fair value and the changes in fair value of the hypothetical derivative.

The standard establishes a new model for revenue recognition which will be applied to all contracts stipulated with customers, with the exception of those falling within the scope of other IAS/IFRS standards such as leasing, insurance contracts and financial instruments. The fundamental steps for booking revenues according to the new model are as follows: - identification of the contract with the customer; - identification of the performance obligations of the contract; - price determination; - allocation of the price to the performance obligations in the contract; - criteria for registration of the revenue when the entity satisfies each performance obligation.

In particular, in the case of “premium” credit collection contracts (sub i), according to provisions of the new standard, the following was carried out: - recognition of “at point in time” revenue, upon tax collection inasmuch as, based on contract terms governing the consideration, the Company has the unconditioned right to collection only upon completion of the service (i.e. collection of the tax); - recognition of an asset (“Deferred contract costs”), against contract costs (cost borne to execute the contract), to the extent they are deemed to be recoverable (i.e. within the limits of the amount of overall estimated future performances); - expense to income statement of the cost pertaining to each financial year in the amount corresponding to the transfer of asset-related services to customers and the related recognition in the income statement. It should be highlighted that, in addition to the above-mentioned effects, analyses were carried out on other aspects of the contracts with customers that were relevant for the Group’s assets and business. No significant impact was recognised in the application of the new standard. For example, reference is made to contractual issues (costs to obtain a contract, guarantees) that were measured and recorded pursuant to the new standard, whose analysis is in any case taken into consideration also for new contracts. The application of the new standard generated a reduction of the shareholders’ equity as of January 1, 2018 of Euro 4.2 million (net of tax effect). In the event of retroactive application of the new IFRS 15 standard to the Group financial statements as of December 31, 2017, the results would have been disclosed with: - a decrease in total revenues equal to Euro 27.4 million; - a decrease in operating expenses equal to Euro 21.5 million; - an increase of taxes of Euro 1.7 million. - On July 24, 2014, the IASB published the final version of IFRS 9—“Financial Instruments”. The document includes the results of the IASB project, aimed at superseding the IAS 39 standard. The new standard should be applied by the financial statements as of January 1, 2018 or subsequent years. The standard introduces new criteria for the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. In particular, and in the case of financial assets, the new standard utilises a unique approach based on the modalities for management of financial instruments and on the characteristics of contractual cash flows of the financial assets themselves in order to determine the valuation criterion, thereby replacing the various rules provided for by IAS 39. In the case of borrowings, on the other hand, the primary modification concerned the booking of changes in the fair value of a financial liability classified as a financial liability and measured at fair value in the income statement in the case that these changes were due to a change in the credit rating of the issuer of the liability itself. According to the new standard, these changes must be booked in “Other comprehensive income” and no longer in the income statement. Moreover, in the event of non-substantial modifications of liabilities, it is no longer allowed to spread the economic effects of renegotiation over the residual duration of the payable, by modifying the effective interest rate at that date, and the related effect will have to be recognised in the income statement. With reference to impairment, the new standard requires that the estimate of losses on receivables must be implemented on the basis of the model of expected losses (and not the model of incurred losses utilised by IAS 39) by using supportable information that is available without unreasonable charges or efforts and which include historical, current or forecasted data. The standard requires that this impairment model be applicable to all F-194 ----- financial instruments, i.e. to financial assets measured at their amortised cost as well as those measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, receivables deriving from rental contracts and trade receivables. Finally, the standard introduces a new model of hedge accounting in order to adjust the requirements needed by the current IAS 39, which are occasionally considered too strict and unsuitable to reflect the risk management policies of companies. The primary novelties within the document include the following: - an increase in the type of transactions eligible for hedge accounting, even including the risks of non-financial assets/liabilities which are eligible to be managed in hedge accounting; - a change in the modalities for booking forward contracts and options when these are included in a hedge accounting relationship and in order to reduce the volatility of the income statement; - changes to the efficacy test through the replacement of the current modalities based on the 80-125% parameter with the principle of the “economic relationship” between the hedged item and hedging instrument; in addition, an evaluation of the retrospective efficacy of the hedging relationship will no longer be requested. The increased flexibility of the new accounting rules is counterbalanced by additional requests for reporting on the risk management activities of the Group. Summary table of the consolidated equity-financial position, restated as of January 1, 2018: for sale, held for distribution to shareholders and discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5. The amendment was applied as from January 1, 2018. The adoption of these amendments had no impact on the Group consolidated financial statements. - On December 8, 2016, the IASB issued the amendment to the IAS 40—“Transfers of Investment steps, including the complete mapping of contracts that are potentially suited to include a lease, and the analysis of the same in order to understand the main clauses that are relevant for the purposes of IFRS 16. Directors initiated a project aimed at implementing the new standard which envisages, as first step, a detailed analysis of contracts and accounting impacts and, as a second step, the implementation and/ or adjustment of administrative processes and the accounting system. Directors have not yet defined the approach that they intend to adopt amongst those permitted by the IFRS 16 standard. The Company elected to apply this standard by using the modified retrospective transition method and recording the cumulated effect resulting from the application of the standard to shareholders’ equity as of January 1, 2019, pursuant to provisions set forth in paragraphs IFRS 16: C7-C13. In particular, in relation to lease contracts previously classified as operating leases, the Company will account for the following: a) a financial liability, equal to the present value of residual future payments at the transition date, discounted by using, for each single contract, the incremental borrowing rate applicable at the transition date; b) a right of use, equal to the value of the financial liability at the transition date, net of any accruals and deferrals related to the lease and recognised in the statement of financial position at the reporting date of these financial statements. The following table shows the estimated impact of the IFRS 16 adoption at transition date. The transition to IFRS 16 introduces some elements of professional advice, which involve the definition of some accounting policies and the use of assumptions and estimates in relation of the lease term, upon definition of the incremental borrowing rate. - On October 12, 2017, the IASB published an amendment to IFRS 9—“Prepayment Features with - the expected revenue is recognised over the coverage period for the contracts, taking account of adjustments resulting from changes in assumptions related to cash flows of each single cluster of contracts. The PAA approach measures the liability for the remaining coverage of a cluster of insurance contracts provided that, upon initial recognition, the entity provides that this liability reasonably represents a reasonable approximation to the General Model. Contracts with a coverage period of one year or less are automatically eligible for the PAA approach. Simplifications resulting from the application of the PAA method are not applicable to the measurement of liabilities for claims in place, that are measured based on the General Model. However, discounting of cash flows is not required if the balance is likely to be paid or received within one year from the claim date. The entity shall apply the new principle to insurance contracts issued, including reinsurance contracts issued, reinsurance contracts held and investment contracts with discretionary participation features (DPF). The standard is applicable as from January 1, 2021 but early application is allowed solely for entities which apply IFRS 9—Financial Instruments and IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Directors deem that the adoption of this standard will not have a significant effect on the Group consolidated financial statements. - On June 7, 2017 the IASB issued the interpretation document IFRIC 23—Uncertainty over Income The amendments are applicable as from January 1, 2019 but earlier application is permitted. The Directors are currently evaluating the possible impact of the introduction of these amendments on the Group consolidated financial statements. - On February 7, 2018 the IASB published the document “Plant Amendment, Curtailment or the case of loss of control of a subsidiary, even if the entity continues to retain a non-controlling quota and including in this case even the transfer or conferment of a subsidiary to a joint venture or associate. The amendments introduced envisage that in the sale or transfer of an asset or a subsidiary company to a joint venture or associate, the measurement of a profit or loss to be recognised in the financial statements of the transferring/receiving company will depend on whether the assets or the subsidiary sold or transferred represent a business, as envisaged by IFRS 3. If the assets or subsidiary company sold or transferred represent a business, the entity shall recognise the profit or loss on the entire portion previously held. Conversely, the portion of profit or loss, related to the interests which is still held by the entity, should be derecognised. At the moment, the IASB has suspended the application of this amendment.

To this purpose, the Group developed a new credit risk modelling, which allowed for analytically determining the different credit risk related to customers’ creditworthiness since the occurrence of receivables and progressively according to their ageing. This information was used by the Group in determining the bad debt provision according to the impairment modelling based on expected credit loss, which involved an effect on the initial shareholders’ equity related to the implementation of IFRS 9, equal to a reduction of the same by Euro 0.49 million as a consequence of a credit reduction of equal amount (i.e. Euro 0.49 million), without significant amendments to economic data of the first half 2018. The decrease in retained earnings refers to the recording of further and possible losses due to the reduction of financial assets resulting from the application of the provisional model for the expected credit loss, introduced by IFRS 9 in replacement of the incurred credit loss model envisaged by IAS 39. Based on this new modelling, also financial assets that are not overdue were analysed. No impairment was reported for these assets. It is also specified that impairment recorded on January 1, 2018 referred primarily to trade receivables. The analyses made on financial assets and liabilities reported no relevant impairment.

The document supplies some clarifications on the definition of the business for the purposes,3057.33.1,,"of a correct application of the IFRS 3 standard. In particular, the amendment clarifies that while a business usually produces an output, the presence of an output is not strictly necessary to determine a business in the presence of an integrated set of activities/processes and assets. However, in order to be considered a business, a set of activities/processes and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. To this purpose, the IASB replaced the wording “ability to create output” with “ability to contribute to create outputs” to clarify that a business can exist also without the presence of all inputs and processes necessary to create an output. The amendment has also introduced a concentration test, optional for the entity, that permits an assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. If the test outcome is positive, the acquired set of activities/processes and assets is not a business and the standard does not require further assessments. If the test outcome is negative, the entity shall carry out further analyses to determine whether the acquired activities/processes and assets is a business. To this purpose, the amendment added a number of illustrative examples to the IFRS 3 standard in order to help entities understand the practical application of the new definition of business in specific cases. Amendments are applicable to all business combinations and subsequent acquisitions of assets, as from January 1, 2020 but early application is allowed.

The method used to estimate the value of the trademark was chosen by taking account of the purposes of the transaction and the features of the intangible asset itself. In particular, in line with the literature and the best professional practice, the value of the trademark owned by Engineering was determined by using the income-based method, based on the discounting of future benefits attributable to the intangible asset subject to value appraisal. The trademark is a right which is legally protected through the registration at the competent authorities. By reason of the fact that this right has no legal, contract, competitive or economic term, which limits its useful life, the same is classified as indefinite life intangible asset and therefore it is not amortised but it is subject to impairment loss when tested for impairment, as provided for by IAS 36. The impairment test, performed on December 31, 2017, confirmed that no impairment was needed on the value of the trademark disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. In the first half of 2018, the Group’s performance, in terms of operating results, and forecasts for the entire 2018, remained substantially unchanged with respect to forecasts included in the 2018 budget and assumptions for the following years developed by the corporate management. Therefore, there are no indicators that the trademark was impaired in 2018. F-205 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

In particular the retrospective change is attributable: - in the amount of Euro -47,470 thousand, to the final allocation of goodwill, in relation to Infogroup S.p.A. (goodwill generated from the transaction is entirely allocated); - in the amount of Euro -15,804 thousand, to the outcome of the final allocation of goodwill related to the company IT Soft US Inc. (residual goodwill at the date of these financial statements, equal to Euro 798 thousand); - in the amount of Euro -731 thousand, to the outcome of the final goodwill related to the company Sofiter Tech S. r.l. (goodwill at the date of these financial statements is entirely allocated); - in the amount of Euro -537 thousand, to the outcome of the final allocation of goodwill related to the company Fair Dynamics Consulting GmbH (residual goodwill at the date of these financial statements is entirely allocated); - in the amount of Euro -292 thousand, to the outcome of the final allocation of goodwill related to the company Bekast IT Consulting GmbH (residual goodwill is equal to Euro 441 thousand); - in the amount of Euro -1,735 thousand, to the outcome of the final allocation of goodwill related to the company Sogeit Solutions S.r.l. (residual goodwill is equal to Euro 3,565 thousand); - in the amount of Euro -1,516 thousand, to the outcome of the merger into Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. and final allocation of goodwill related to the company Infinity Tecnology Solutions S.p.A. (goodwill at the date of these financial statements is entirely allocated); - in the amount of -1,055 thousand, to the outcome of the merger into MHT S.r.l. and final allocation of goodwill related to the company Pyxis S.r.l. (goodwill is entirely allocated). Goodwill recognised during the year is equal to Euro 6,600,940. - in the amount of Euro 2,701 thousand, to the final allocation of goodwill, in relation to INF.OR. S.r.l. in Municipia. This goodwill was allocated to the corresponding CGU; - in the amount of Euro 2,018 thousand, in relation to the purchase transaction of the company Icraft GmbH, occurred on June 1, 2018, as described in Note 1.2 herein, and allocated to the corresponding CGU; - in the amount of Euro 697 thousand, to the purchase transaction of the company Icode GmbH, occurred on June 1, 2018, as described in Note 1.2 herein, and allocated to the corresponding CGU; - in the amount of Euro 185 thousand, to the purchase of the company LG-NET S.r.l. on July 10, 2018, as described in Note 1.2 herein, and allocated to the corresponding CGU; - in the amount of Euro 800 thousand, to the purchase transaction of the company EuroAMS d.o.o., occurred on February 28, 2018, as described in Note 1.2 herein, and allocated to the corresponding CGU; - in the amount of Euro 600 thousand, to the purchase occurred, through awarding by competitive tender, of the business unit of the company Sofiter Tech S.p.A., in liquidation, by the company Sofiter Tech S.r.l.; - in the amount of Euro -400 thousand, following the write-down of the business unit of the company SP Sapiens S.r.l. acquired by the Parent Company. The 2018 exchange rate differences related to goodwill amounted to around Euro -80 thousand and refer to the goodwill of Dynpro Systemas S.A., as the value in local currency remained unchanged. The analysis was performed to determine the goodwill recoverable value, which was allocated to Cash Generating Units (CGU) to which it is related. F-209 ----- The impairment test, made on December 31, 2018 on the goodwill allocated to the Cash Generating Units (CGU), to which goodwill is related, confirmed that there is no need for write-downs of the value disclosed in the financial statements. In 2019, the Group performance, in terms of operating results, remained substantially unchanged with respect to forecasts included in the 2019 budget and assumptions for the following years developed by the corporate Management. Therefore, there are no indicators that goodwill was impaired in 2018. CGU is defined as an asset or small group of assets that generate incoming cash flows that are widely independent from the incoming cash flows resulting from other assets or group of assets. The CGUs were determined based on the market segments and the single operating investees, consistently with the corporate management view in terms of monitoring of results and economic planning. An analysis of the total value of goodwill was made as per the IAS 36 and IFRS 3 international accounting standards. The value of the goodwill as of December 31, 2018, tested for impairment, was Euro 67,365,314, as described hereunder. Hereunder are the main basic assumptions, used for impairment testing.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

There is no evidence at the present date for the Group to proceed with any write-down. It should be noted, if still necessary, that the recoverable value of the CGUs was prudently estimated and in compliance with the relevant accounting standard and in line with IFRS measurement practices. For the identification of the recoverable value—the “value in use” of the CGUs—obtained through discounting, of the cash flows (DCF Model) extrapolated from the four-year business plans drawn up by the management of the divisions, the following elements were considered: a) estimates of future cash flows generated by the entity; b) expected possible changes in these cash flows in terms of the amount and time periods; c) cost of money, comprising the current market risk-free rate of interest; d) cost to assume the risk related to implicit uncertainty in the management of the CGU; e) other risk factors concerning the operations of a specific market and changes over time.

The parameters utilised for discounting the cash flows and the Terminal Value under the DCF model illustrated above were as follows: - Risk free rate, equal to the average rate of 2018, supplied by Barclays and extrapolated by Bloomberg (> 2%); - Equity Risk Premium, equal to the higher yield estimated from the (share) investment market, compared to an investment in risk-free debt securities. The rate taken as a benchmark for assessments relates to 2018, supplied by Barclays and extrapolated by Damodaran (> 5%); - Debt cost, equal to the average indebtedness cost (long and short term) of the Group > 1%; - Beta unlevered equal to 1; - LTG (Long Term Growth) equal to 0.5%. For a WACC: - of 7.76% for the CGU Finance, Energy & Utilities, Telco & Media, PAL Health and Taxes and EXC; - of 7.07% for the OverIT S.p.A. CGU; - of 8.55% for the Nexen S.p.A. CGU; - of 6.46% for the ITS Engineering AG CGU; - of 6.46% for the Bekast IT Consulting GmbH CGU; - of 8.55% for the Sogeit Solutions S.r.l. CGU; - of 8.86% for the IT Soft US Inc. CGU. As recommended by the best practice, the component of the Terminal Value was limited to a maximum of 70% of the total sum of the discounted “free cash flow” and the Terminal Value itself. To this purpose, it is worth noting that, to determine the WACC, the following was used: - Risk free rate, equal to 2.59% when the gross yield of 5-year BTPs is equal to 2.35% - Equity Risk Premium extracted by Damodaran equal to 5.96%. As a consequence, the approach used included parameters of absolute prudence by using a high WACC compared to Group characteristics. F-211 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

In order to determine the expected credit loss, trade receivables were initially grouped by counterparty (third parties and Public Administration) and then, for receivables from third parties only, by overdue days. Customer contract assets refer to invoices to be issued for work in progress, and feature substantially the same risks as trade receivables for the same type of contracts. The Group therefore concluded that the expected credit loss for trade receivables represents a reasonable approximation of losses on customer contract assets. Rates on expected credit loss are based on collection terms over a period of 545 days prior to January 1, 2018, and the corresponding losses on historical receivables during this period. Historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect the current and future macroeconomic condition affecting the customers’ ability to repay receivables. The Group has defined the default average rate of Italian companies for the 2018-2019 two-year period, as relevant factor in relation to receivables to third parties, while it recognised the specific risk of the country as primary factor for receivables from the Public Administration. These factors were used to adjust the recognised historical loss rates. On this base, the bad debt provision, to be jointly written-down as of January 1, 2018, was determined as follows. Based on the above-mentioned model, no significant impact is reported that require the adjustment of the bad debt provision as of December 31, 2018. F-217 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725
1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,3058,4.30 SEASONALITY OF GROUP OPERATIONS,3058.74,Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 14 Trade receivables (Continued),3058.74.1,,"_Expected Credit Loss—Receivables to third parties_ In the mutual interest, on October 9, 2012 SISEV, the Sicilian Region and Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. signed an “agreement” which regulated the repayment of SISEV receivables, indicating the final repayment date on December 31, 2013. Moreover, this agreement outlined that the Sicilian Region was undertaking to carry out controls and provide Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. with all the technical and economic means, so as the latter would have been able to correctly fulfil its obligations, and envisaged that, while executing the agreement, such obligations would have been undertaken by SISEV. Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and the Sicilian Region fulfilled their obligations only partially as to the receivable refunding plan, as envisaged by the agreement, although no objections were arisen with respect to the correct performance of services rendered. Given the non-payments of Sicilia Digitale S.p.A., on June 26, 2013, SISEV filed a petition for an order of payment with the Court of Palermo against Sicilia Digitale S.p.A., and obtained the payment order for Euro 30,052 thousand (in addition to interests, expenses and remunerations, VAT and CPA), for which, however, no execution order was given. Moreover, to safeguard its rights, on July 18, 2014 SISEV applied for a distraint order over all receivables from the Sicilian Region to Sicilia Digitale S.p.A., up to the entire amounts receivable accrued by the company. On November 10, 2014, the Court of Palermo rejected SISEV’s request while underlying that “given that, besides Sicilia e-Servizi S.p.A., also the Sicilian Region (via its accountant general), _an undoubtedly solvent entity, is directly committed with respect to Sicilia e-Servizi Venture S.c.r.l. -... Omitted ... there is no urgency (periculum in mora) ...”. In other words, the Judge reported no credit risk, while highlighting_ the “guarantor” role played by the Sicilian Region in favour of SISEV. As regards Sicilia Digitale S.p.A.’s judgement of opposition to the first order decree, deposited on September 3, 2013, obtained in the amount of around Euro 30,052 thousand, the Judge ordered an Office Technical Expertise aimed at evaluating, inter alia, the actual services rendered by SISEV, which are related to the invoicing subject to the order of payment. On December 17, 2016, the Office Technical Experts, designated for the assessment of the actual performance by Venture of services that are related to the invoicing object of the payment order, transmitted to the parties a first draft of the expertise where a total amount receivable of Euro 28,068 thousand was assessed in favour of Venture. Therefore, almost the entire amount claimed in Court was assessed by experts (taking account that in the arrears some payments were received by Venture and today the receivables in question were equal to Euro 28,346 thousand). Following a request of integration by the Judge, the experts therefore issued and lodged the supplementary expertise (in which the assets object of the payment claim were divided according to the existence or non-existence of approvals by the management of Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and/or the Region). After filing the supplementary expertise, as a result of the specification of the conclusion to the involved parties, with sentence of August 30, 2018, the Judge also ordered Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. to pay Euro 19,508 thousand in favour of SISEV, in addition to interests, starting from, and at the rate shown in the order decree. The Judge therefore relied on the opinions of the experts, included in the supplementary expertise, and assigned to SISEV only the services certified by SISE’s managers. SISEV proposed a timely objection to be filed against the above-mentioned sentence. In addition to the above, on February 18, 2016, SISEV sent a writ of summons to obtain the payment of the entire amount of receivables (around Euro 79,675 thousand, including the works recognised in the financial statements to complete the amount already requested with an appeal for an order of payment) as the company deems, as already stated, that these amounts were correctly originated and are correctly payable, also pursuant to provisions contained in the trilateral agreement signed on October 9, 2012 by the Sicilian Region, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and SISEV. Both parties, i.e. the Sicilian Region and Sicilia Digitale S.p.A., appeared and filed objections including, but not limited to, the fact that the measure dated October 9, 2012 was invalid, the service contracts and related orders were null and void, Venture unfulfilled its know-how transfer obligations. The parties also filed a claim for damages for a total amount of Euro 95,643 thousand. These plaintiff’s claims were objected at the first hearing of June 8, 2016. After filing the pre-trial briefs, the Judge reserved on the ruling of all claims submitted, including but not limited to, evidence by SISEV based on documents and expertises. On May 30, 2018, the Office Technical Experts, designated by the Court of Palermo, transmitted to the parties and related experts the draft of the expertise. Given the extent of this document, the Company firstly asked the Judge to postpone the terms to file objections to the expertise. The Judge upheld the request and granted the extension by assigning to the parties the final term of September 30, 2018 to file the respective remarks on the expertise. The experts were assigned a further term of October 30, 2018 to file the conclusive F-219 ----- report, together with remarks of the parties. The Court fixed the hearing on November 8, 2018. The abovementioned final report highlights (i) an assessed receivable of SISEV for the amount of only Euro 4,198 thousand, against the request of Euro 79,675 thousand and (ii) supplies the Judge, as possible alternative evaluation criterion, a second calculation stating an overall amount receivable of Venture for Euro 26,157 thousand. The case was adjourned to December 12, 2019 for the evaluation of the experts. The Directors stated that, deeming the expertise materially omitting and misstating, a new request to renew the experts is being filed. It should be noted that, in addition to the aforesaid, no specific critical issues or formal claims related to the correct execution of services and good quality of products delivered by SISEV were highlighted by Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and/or the Sicilian Region. Moreover, the above-mentioned claims do not seem prima facie suited to stop the aggregate claims of SISEV. To date, it is therefore deemed that the defence of the summoned parties are not such to affect the evaluation on the collectability of receivables in favour of SISEV. Given the correctness of credit lines and the correct execution of services, after assessing that the expertise drawn up by the experts and concerning the writ of summons to obtain the payment of receivables amounting to around Euro 79,675 thousand, is materially omitting and misstating, the Directors, supported by the opinion of the legal advisers, and after performing the adequate checks, deem that SISEV’s amount receivables from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. are payable. In any case, after acknowledging, among other, the continuous change in institutional interlocutors and the difficulty in achieving an amicable agreement, in view of a legal dispute and of the objections filed in by Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and the Sicilian Region, in its financial statements the subsidiary SISEV recognised the interest set out by law pertaining to the year under evaluation (around Euro 7.8 million) in the income statement and under item financial income, in addition to the amount already recognised until December 31, 2017 (for a total amount of around Euro 41.7 million) and allocated an amount of around Euro 7.8 million to the bad debt provision, in addition to the total amount of around Euro 53.2 million already allocated to the bad debt provision in the previous year. The latter included the total impairment of the aforesaid interest set out by law and recognised in the financial statements and, for the remaining portion, the impairment of the nominal value of the receivable. The Directors stated that this decision results from an estimate made after a careful evaluation of all information currently available. Overdue receivables by sector are shown in the following table: Receivables due for overdue invoices at the reporting date of 2018 financial statements, remained substantially unchanged compared to December 2017. The closing balance of the bad debt provision for trade receivables was reconciled to the related opening balance as follows.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The price to exercise the option is fixed based on economic parameters and adequately valued multipliers. The fair value of liabilities, which represents a reasonable estimate of the exercise price for the option, was determined based on contract terms set out in the related contract, by using the parameters that are inferable from the 2019-2021 plan of the subsidiary involved; F-228 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Post-employment benefits, accrued after January 1, 2007, represent a “defined contribution plan”. Periodically the Company pays post-employment benefits accrued to a separate entity (e.g. INPS and/or a Fund) with the payment fulfilling obligations toward employees. For accounting purposes, it is included under other contributions, as post-employment benefit matured is recorded as a cost in the period with the payable recognised under short-term payables. Post-employment benefits accrued up to December 31, 2006 continue to represent a “defined benefit plan” which is more certain in terms of their existence and sum, but uncertain in terms of manifestation. The total amount of the benefit obligation is calculated and certified on an annual basis by an independent actuary by using the “Projected Unit Credit” method. A summary of the actuarial assumptions adopted in measuring Post-employment benefits is provided below: Financial Assumptions: - future annual rates of inflation were set according to the average rates of inflation in Italy in recent years, based on ISTAT data; - future annual revaluation rates of existing provisions and subsequent payments fixed, as established by regulations at 75% of the inflation rate plus 1.50% net of taxes; - the annual discount rate was established as variable from 0.1484% to 1.2861% and was deducted adopting a rate curve combining the effective yield rates movements of the Euro Bonds of primary companies with AA rating or higher. Demographic assumptions: - to evaluate length of employment with the Company, the “Tavola di permanenza nella posizione di attivo” RG48 (a table for company service length prepared by the Italian Treasury Department based on data for those born in 1948) was used, selected, projected and separated by gender, supplemented with the probability of additional reasons for departure (resignations, advances which are a financialbased cause for leaving, measurable in terms of cancellation probability, and other). The following table show the absolute and relative changes in liabilities measured according to IAS 19 (DBO), while assuming a 10% negative or positive change in the revaluation and/or discounting rates.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

It totalled Euro 0.2 million (the fair value of options granted in the first pool amounted to Euro 15.92 per option). The fair value of rights assigned during 2018 was calculated upon assignment. In particular, the main inputs used to measure the fair value as of June 30, 2018, of the Stock Option Plan are summarised as follows: - multiple of EV/EBITDA, determined as mean of a panel of listed comparable values; - interest rate curve [IRS 3 years] as of June 30, 2018; - historical volatility [AT 260 days], observed as of June 30, 2018; - dividend yield equal to zero for the stock grant measurement; - historical series of logarithmic yields for the securities involved; - liquidity discount equal to 20%; - strike price equal to Euro 42.15, contractually determined. The fair value of options granted in the first pool amounted to Euro 15.92 per option. The fair value at the assignment date was determined independently and based on the following parameters for the options granted: - options are granted free; - options accrued are exercisable; - the exercise price is Euro 0; - the concession time is 3.5 years; - the exercise price for each share at the assignment date is Euro 42.15.

In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it is assumed that the market, which is correctly used, coincides with the principal market or, in its absence, with the most advantageous market; c) as regards non-financial assets, definition of the highest and best use. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the highest and best use coincides with the current use of the asset; d) definition of the most appropriate valuation techniques for measurement at fair value. These techniques maximise the use of observable inputs that market participants would use when pricing the asset or the liability; e) determination of asset fair value, i.e. estimation of the price at which an asset would be sold; determination of the fair value of liabilities and equity instruments, i.e. estimation of the price for the related transfer in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; f) inclusion of the “non-performance risk” while measuring assets and liabilities and, especially for financial instruments, determination of an adjustment factor in measurement at fair value in order to include not only the counterparty risk (CVA—credit valuation adjustment), but also its own debt risk (DVA—debit valuation adjustment). According to the inputs used for measurements at fair value, a fair value hierarchy was defined, according to which assets and liabilities, measured at fair value, are to be classified, or for which the fair value is disclosed in the financial statements: a) level 1: listed prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to those under evaluation; b) level 2: observable inputs, different from those included in level 1, such as: (i) listed prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; (ii) listed prices in non-active markets for similar or identical assets or liabilities; (iii) other observable inputs (interest rate curves, implicit volatility, credit spreads); c) level 3: unobservable inputs, to be used to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available. Unobservable inputs used to measure fair value reflect the assumptions that the market participants would make in pricing assets and liabilities to be measured. Reference is made to the table hereunder for the definition of the level of fair value hierarchy according to which the single instruments measured at fair value were classified. No transfers from the various levels of fair value hierarchy occurred during the year. The fair value of derivatives is determined by discounting expected cash flows, by using the curve of market interest rates at the reference date, and the curve of listed credit default swaps of the counterparty and of Group companies to include the non-performance risk, as explicitly envisaged by IFRS 13. As regards medium/long-term financial instruments, other than derivatives, wherever market prices are not available, the fair value is determined by discounting expected cash flows, by using the curve of market interest rates at the reference date and considering the counterparty risk in the event of financial assets and its own credit risk in the event of borrowings. As of January 1, 2019 (first-time application of IFRS 9), the Group management evaluated which business model would have been applicable to financial assets held and classified its financial instruments within appropriate categories, as envisaged by IFRS 9. Moreover, the Group reclassified the borrowings based on new provisions set out by IFRS 9.

By effect of the above-mentioned acquisition, Engineering D.HUB S.p.A. also acquired the indirect ownership of controlling interests, owned by Cybertech, in a series of Italian and foreign companies located in Serbia, Norway, Sweden, Spain and Switzerland. _Information on members of the Board of Directors and Control Boards_ The members of the Board of Directors and Control Boards are listed in paragraph I. “Corporate Governance and Corporate Bodies” in the Directors’ Report. _Disclosures on share-based remuneration plans_ On June 28, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a Stock Option Plan addressed to employees, consultants, collaborators and directors of the Company and the Group companies controlled by the same and aimed at being an incentive for Group growth commitments and obtaining loyalty from beneficiaries. This is a Stock Option Plan for the shares of the Company Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A.. Within this plan, 911,759 options are assigned, for free, to beneficiaries. The options, when exercisable, give the right to subscribe one share each (of special B class), corresponding to 7.5% of the share capital, before a dedicated increase. Options are divided in three pools: the first pool, including 897,718 options, and the second and third pool, of equal number of options, for the residual amount. The exercise price of each option, being part of the first pool, is equal to Euro 42.15 each, while the exercise price of each option included in the second and third pool will be instead determined by the Board of Directors, on an annual basis, according to the Company’s “Market Fair Value” at the date of price determination. The options become exercisable provided that determined time and performance objectives be achieved (so-called “vested options”). These options can be exercised only starting from the notification of the expiry term of the plan and not later than the business day prior to the expiry term of the plan. The exercise of the options is also subordinated to the occurrence of a disinvestment (i.e. the transfer of quotes and shares representing more than 50% of the subscribed and paid capital of Engineering, Newco or Holdco; the transfer of all Group assets; the admission to trade on a regulated market) and will be effective upon completion of the same at the expiry date of the plan. Shares are available to the beneficiary at the expiry date of the plan. At the expiry date of the plan, the Board of Directors has the faculty to pay the beneficiary the difference between i) the Market Fair Value of shares assigned to the beneficiary and ii) the exercise price. In that case, the beneficiary will not have the right to claim the issue of shares and options assigned to him will no longer be valid. Despite the fact that the Board of Directors is vested with the power to choose between the payment in cash and the issue of equity instruments, the Directors deem that, at the balance-sheet date, the Company does not have any current obligations for cash payment. Therefore, the plan was accounted for as share-based payment transaction. After the exercise of share options, shares subscribed by the beneficiary have dividend entitlement the day after the expiry term of the plan. The Company has the right to ask the beneficiary to repay the minimum amount sufficient to cover tax charges set out by law. F-256 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Our audit was performed based on the Rules of Conduct of the Board of Statutory Auditors approved by the Italian Accounting Profession (Consiglio Nazionale dei Dottori Commercialisti e degli Esperti Contabili). The Group has adopted the IFRS International Accounting Standards since the 2005 financial year. Pursuant to Article 2409-septies of the Italian Civil Code, the Board also states that they exchanged information with the Group’s Independent Auditors, Deloitte & Touche S.p.A.. The financial statements of each subsidiary are reported as regularly approved by the related Boards and audited within the limits and pursuant to modalities envisaged by the audit plan defined by the Independent Auditors. The plan is deemed adequate and sufficient to express the required professional opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. We audited the Group consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018, and we assessed that the identification of the consolidation scope and the election of both consolidation principles for equity investments, and procedures adopted for this purpose, are compliant with law and the accounting standards applicable in these cases, including new standards IFRS 9 and 15, as from January 1, 2018. Their impacts on the consolidated financial statements were duly described in the Explanatory Notes. The Board of Statutory Auditors acknowledged that, in its report dated April 1, 2019, the Independent Auditors Deloitte & Touche S.p.A. also expressed an opinion without remarks, comments or recalls to disclosures in relation to the consolidated financial statements ended December 31, 2018. Taking also account of the opinion expressed by the Independent Auditors, we hereby certify that the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 have been prepared in compliance with provisions set forth by Legislative Decree no. 127/1991, as amended. The criteria adopted by the Board of Directors, duly described in the Explanatory Notes on the consolidated financial statements, as well as in the financial statements valuations and value adjustments, are based on the general and usual criteria adopted on a going concern basis. The Directors’ report, included in the consolidated financial statements, was audited by us to assess its compliance with the expected minimum content, as envisaged in the applicable standards. Based on the audit performed, the Board deems that the Group Directors’ report is fair, exhaustive and consistent with the consolidated financial statements. The Board of Statutory Auditors also audited the Impairment Tests, drawn up by the board internal to the Group and the measurement of the Goodwill item entered under Assets in the consolidated financial statements, and it shared the outcome in numerical terms and considerations, thoroughly described in the Explanatory Notes. While considering also the outcome of the audit performed by the auditing company, as shown in the Independent Auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements issued on April 1, 2019, in which no remarks or recalls to disclosures are reported, the Board of Statutory Auditors deems that no notifications on the consolidated financial statements are worth reporting herein.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2017, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. _Basis for Opinion_ We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the _Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of Engineering lngegneria_ Informatica S.p.A. (“Company”) in accordance with the ethical requirements applicable under Italian law to the audit of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. _Responsibilities of the Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors for the Consolidated Financial Statements_ The Directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and, within the terms established by law, for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they have identified the existence of the conditions for the liquidation of the Company or the termination of the business or have no realistic alternatives to such choices.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors. - Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

(“Mic Bidco”) in the entire subsidiary Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. was completed on May 24, 2017. The reverse Merger of Mic Bidco S.p.A. into Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. produced its legal effects to third parties, pursuant to article 2504-bis, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code, which will be effective at the date of the last record, as envisaged by Article 2504 of the Italian Civil Code. The accounting effects of the Merger will be instead effective since the first day of the financial year related to the effective date of the Merger (January 1, 2017). Therefore, as from the effective date of the Merger: - the nominal value of Mic Bidco S.p.A.’s shares was cancelled; - 343,213 treasury shares were cancelled; - the post-merger share capital of Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. amounted to Euro 31,875,000, equal to the original amount, divided in 12,156,787 shares with no nominal value; - the share capital was entirely assigned to the sole Shareholder Mic Newco S.p.A..

Moreover, albeit the fact that the parent-subsidiary Merger transactions cannot be defined as a business combination according to the international accounting standards applied by the Company and the Group for the drawing up of the separate and consolidated financial statements, the reverse Merger under evaluation, which followed the acquisition of control, carried out in 2016, of Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. and its subsidiaries by the same Mic Bidco S.p.A., is to be recognised in compliance with IFRS 3. As regards this last transaction and as better described in the following paragraph, the accounting treatment, pursuant to IFRS 3, has been completed in the current year. The above being said, after the completion of the reverse Merger project of Mic Bidco S.p.A. into Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A., these post-merger consolidated financial statements of the Engineering Group are substantially the continuation of the Mic Bidco S.p.A. financial statements (except for the capital structure), therefore reflecting: - assets and liabilities of Mic Bidco S.p.A., at the pre-combination book value; - assets and liabilities of Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. and its subsidiaries (“Engineering Group”), measured at their fair value at the acquisition date, pursuant to provisions set out by IFRS 3; - retained earnings and the equity reserves of the company Mic Bidco S.p.A. before the business combination and the following cancellation of the shareholders’ equity items of Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A., except for some reserves (for which reference is made to next paragraph 18), as a contra-entry of the “Merger reserve”. - **1.2 ACQUISITIONS AND SALES FOR THE YEAR - on July 8, 2016, following the purchase of 100% of the share capital of the Issuer, Borsa Italiana S.p.A., with measure no. 8227 of July 1, 2016, ordered a trading suspension of the Issuer’s shares on the Electronic Equity Market for the sessions of July 6 and 7, 2016 and their delisting since July 8, 2016. Within the above context, at end June 2016 (acquisition date), the company Mic Bidco S.p.A. acquired the control, pursuant to IFRS 10, of Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A., through the acquisition of interests, calculating all treasury shares already owned by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. in the equity investment of Mic Bidco S.p.A., equal to 97.457%, and then fulfilling the purchase obligation to purchase the remaining 2.543% on July 8, 2016. The above being said, for the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the recognition and measurement of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities undertaken were completed (within 12 months from the acquisition date) in relation to the acquisition of Engineering and its subsidiaries. It is noted that the transaction under evaluation was accounted for, in the previous financial statements and pursuant to IFRS 3, by using the acquisition method, which involved the temporary recognition of fair values. The following table shows the total accounting values of assets acquired and liabilities undertaken, at the acquisition date, as well as final values related to identified fair value. The aforesaid recognised amounts feature, inter alia, a change compared to the temporary initial accounting of the business combination, performed in the previous year, which led to the allocation of a value of Euro 387 million as goodwill (the goodwill at year end related to the business combination under evaluation amounted to Euro 49.9 million, which is not deductible for tax purposes). The determination of assets acquired and liabilities undertaken at fair value was made through an estimate, performed with the support of an independent expert, based on assumptions considered reasonable and realistic on the basis of information available at the date of acquisition of control. As envisaged by IFRS 3, the above-mentioned data were retrospectively disclosed at the acquisition date, with the consequent change and supplement of equity and balance sheet figures already temporarily included in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. The residual goodwill (equal to Euro 49.9 million), recorded in the consolidated financial statement at the acquisition date, and not allocated to any other specific assets, was tested for impairment with reference to the control acquisition date and to December 31, 2016, and as provided for by IAS 36. The test confirmed the full recoverability of the residual goodwill. In particular, consistently with provisions set out by IAS 36, for the purpose of impairment testing, at the acquisition date, such goodwill was allocated to the following Cash Generating Units (“CGU”), based on the impact of the reported EBITDA of each single CGU on the total EBITDA generated by CGUs related to 2016 Goodwill. - Finance CGU: Euro 16,344,694; - Energy & Utilities CGU: Euro 9,662,147; - Telco & Media CGU: Euro 6,819,242; - PAL, Health and Taxes CGU: Euro 13,589,040; - Excellence CGU: Euro 345,175; - OverIT CGU: Euro 1,854,482; - Nexen CGU: Euro 410,814; - Dynpro Systemas CGU: Euro 877,702. The CGUs under evaluation were determined based on the market segments and the single operating investees, consistently with the corporate Management view in terms of monitoring of results and economic planning. For a detailed description of Group CGUs, reference is made to note 8 of these Explanatory Notes. For the purposes of impairment testing, the estimate of the value in use was carried out over a four-year timing for each CGU, based on the 2018 budget and assumptions for the following years made by the related Management, by using a similar method as the one applied as of December 31, 2016, to which reference is made. In particular, as regards CGUs to which goodwill was allocated, the growth rate used for cash flows after the reference period and the discount rates adopted are reported hereunder. For further details on the methods and parameters adopted while performing impairment tests, reference is made to paragraph 8. It is noted that, for CGUs that underwent an impairment test, no indication emerged that these assets might have been impaired. _Sensitivity analysis_ Moreover, for all CGUs a sensitivity analysis was performed on the increase in the 1% discount rate. This analysis highlighted no impairment losses. The recoverability of goodwill is also confirmed, with respect to other hypotheses, also taking account of a “g rate” growth rate equal to 0%. The determination of assets acquired and liabilities undertaken at fair value was made through an estimate based on assumptions considered reasonable and realistic on the basis of information available at the date of acquisition of control. As envisaged by IFRS 3, the above-mentioned data were retrospectively disclosed at the acquisition date, with the consequent change and supplement of equity and balance sheet figures already temporarily included in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. The residual goodwill (equal to Euro 5.9 million), recorded in the consolidated financial statement at the acquisition date, and not allocated to any other specific assets, was tested for impairment with reference to the control acquisition date and to December 31, 2016, and as provided for by IAS 36. The test confirmed the full recoverability of the residual goodwill. If the company acquired had been consolidated on a line-by-line basis as from January 1, 2017, the 2017 consolidated revenues and net profit of the Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. Group would have been higher by Euro 0.1 million and lower by Euro 0.01 million, respectively. _Acquisition of control of Dekra Italia S.r.l._ On January 24, 2017, Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. purchased a Business Unit from the company Dekra Italia S.r.l.. Dekra operates in the field of managerial consultancy services through applications and technological platforms. For the purposes of the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, pursuant to IFRS 3, the transaction was accounted for through the use of the acquisition method, which involved the temporary estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities undertaken. Specifically, the book value of assets and liabilities already recognised in the financial statements of the acquired companies, remained substantially unchanged. The following table shows the total book values of acquired assets and liabilities which, following the temporary measurement of fair value, remained unchanged. The following table shows the total book values of acquired assets and liabilities which, following the temporary measurement of fair value, remained unchanged.

If the company acquired had been consolidated on a line-by-line basis as from January 1, 2017, the 2017 consolidated revenues and net profit of the Engineering Ingegneria Informatica Group would have been higher by Euro 1.2 million and Euro 0.2 million, respectively. _Acquisition of control of Infinity Technology Solutions S.p.A._ On September 8, 2017, Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. wholly acquired the company Infinity Technology Solutions S.p.A. with operating office in Genoa. For the purposes of the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, pursuant to IFRS 3, the transaction was accounted for through the use of the acquisition method, which involved the temporary estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities undertaken. Specifically, the book value of assets and liabilities already recognised in the financial statements of the acquired companies, remained substantially unchanged. The following table shows the total book values of acquired assets and liabilities which, following the temporary measurement of fair value, remained unchanged. If the company acquired had been consolidated on a line-by-line basis as from January 1, 2017, the 2017 consolidated revenues and net profit of the Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. Group would have been higher by Euro 4.8 million and lower by Euro 0.1 million, respectively. _Acquisition of control of SedApta US Inc. and IT Soft US Inc._ On September 8, 2017, Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. wholly acquired the company SedApta US Inc., with registered office in Dover, Delaware, which, in its turn, controls 66% of the company IT Soft US Inc., with registered office in Chicago, Illinois. For the purposes of the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, pursuant to IFRS 3, the transaction was accounted for through the use of the acquisition method, which involved the temporary estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities undertaken. Specifically, the book value of assets and liabilities already recognised in the financial statements of the acquired companies, remained substantially unchanged. Taking account that the Company does not hold the entire control, the portion of shareholders’ equity pertaining to minority holders was determined based on the portion pertaining to current values attributed to assets and liabilities at the control acquisition date, excluding any goodwill that can be attributed to such values (so-called partial goodwill method). The following table shows the total book values of acquired assets and liabilities which, following the temporary measurement of fair value, remained unchanged. _Acquisition of control of Sogeit Solutions S.r.l._ On July 1, 2017, Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. proceeded with acquiring 60% of the company Sogeit Solutions S.r.l..

As permitted by IFRS 3, the final recognition of fair value of assets and liabilities of the acquired company will be completed within 12 months from the acquisition date. In relation to current measurements, they will entail effects on the following main items: intangible assets and deferred tax assets and related economic effects. The line-by-line consolidation of the business combination under evaluation, as from the acquisition date, involved the recognition of revenue and profit in the consolidated financial statements of the Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. Group, equal to Euro 5.2 million and Euro 1.6 million, respectively. If the company acquired had been consolidated on a line-by-line basis as from January 1, 2017, the 2017 consolidated revenues and net profit of the Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. Group would have been higher by Euro 4.4 million and Euro 0.7 million, respectively. _Acquisition of control of Infogroup S.p.A._ On December 28, 2017, Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. proceeded with acquiring 100% of the company Infogroup S.p.A..

With this transaction, Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. now owns 51% of the company’s share capital. For the purposes of the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, pursuant to IFRS 3, the transaction was accounted for through the use of the acquisition method, which involved the temporary estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities undertaken. Specifically, the book value of assets and liabilities already recognised in the financial statements of the acquired company, remained substantially unchanged. Taking account that the Company does not hold the entire control, the portion of shareholders’ equity pertaining to minority holders was determined based on the portion pertaining to current values attributed to assets and liabilities at the control acquisition date, excluding any goodwill that can be attributed to such values (so called partial goodwill method).

The IFRS standards have been applied consistently with the periods disclosed herein and, taking account of the best literature on this issue, any future directions and interpretation updates will be reflected in the following financial statements, according to modalities envisaged from time to time by the reference standards. These consolidated financial statements are expressed in Euros and, in compliance with IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” include the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated income statement and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of cash flows and the related Explanatory Notes. As thoroughly described in section “Reverse Merger of Mic Bidco S.p.A. into Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A.”, the reverse Merger did not change the consolidation scope, which remained unchanged compared to what was previously in place as at December 31, 2016. Comparative tables had to be in any case provided, in relation to the previous year, due to the fact that the company Mic Bidco S.p.A., albeit holding the direct control in Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A., had not prepared its consolidated financial statements as it availed itself of the right of exemption envisaged by Legislative Decree 127/1991, Article 27, paragraph 3, by reason of the fact that the consolidated financial statements was prepared by the parent company Mic Holdco S.r.l., and published within the terms set by law. It should be also noted that the comparative income statement tables reflect the accounting results for the company Mic Bidco S.p.A. for the entire year, while, for the company Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. and its subsidiaries they reflect accounts as from the acquisition date of control by Mic Bidco S.p.A., and therefore substantially as from end of June 2016. Within this context, in order to allow for a more immediate and exhaustive reading of performance results, the Directors’ report included the comparative income statement tables that had been restated to reflect the values of the entire 2016 for the Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. Group. The principles utilised are the same as those used for the preparation of the last annual financial statements and were applied evenly, except for the IFRS and IFRIC accounting standards, amendments and interpretations applicable for accounting periods beginning on January 1, 2018, as indicated in paragraph 4.28. The consolidation was carried out under the line-by-line method, including the minority interests reported in the relevant shareholders’ equity and income statement accounts. The Group companies adopted the same accounting period as the Parent Company and the standards utilised are the same for the preparation as the last annual financial statements and were applied in a uniform manner. In the statement of financial position, assets and liabilities are classified according to the “current/ non-current” criterion with separation of assets and liabilities held-for-sale. Current assets are those held for sale or used in the normal business operating cycle or in the twelve months following the year-end. Current liabilities are expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle or within 12 months following the year-end. The income statement is classified according to the nature of the costs while the statement of cash flows uses the direct method. Transactions with related parties are disclosed in the statement of financial position, the income statement and the statement of cash flows. The transactions with related parties concern subsidiaries, associated companies and Directors and Executives with strategic responsibilities. The financial statements are accompanied by the Directors’ report prepared by the Board of Directors in compliance with Article 2428 of the Italian Civil Code, which contains more detailed information on Group operations and significant events after the year-end. - **USE OF ESTIMATES AND MEASUREMENTS The preparation of the financial statements in compliance with IFRS also requires the use of estimates and assumptions in determining the values of the assets and liabilities, costs and revenues and contingent assets and F-280 ----- liabilities. The estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the reporting date and on prior experience where the book value of assets and liabilities is not easily inferable from other sources. However, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are periodically revised and changes are immediately reflected in the income statement. The items that are mostly influenced by estimates are the calculation of amortisation/depreciation, impairment tests on assets (including measurement of receivables), provisions for allocations, employee benefits, fair value of financial assets and liabilities, deferred tax assets and construction contracts, as well as the calculation of fair value of derivatives. For a better understanding of the financial statements, the main estimates utilised in the drawing up of the financial statements are shown hereunder and involve the use of subjective opinions, assumptions and estimates related to issues that are uncertain by nature. The changes in conditions underlying opinions and assumptions might have a significant impact on the following financial years. _Impairment of Assets_ Assets are tested for impairment in order to assess whether any impairment loss has occurred that would involve the reduction in value, in the presence of indicators that foresee a possible difficult recovery of their net book value through their use. The assessment on the presence of the above-mentioned indicators involves subjective evaluations by the Board of Directors, based on information available within the Company and on the market, as well as historical experience. Moreover, if any doubt that a possible impairment loss has arisen, the Company will perform impairment tests by using the measurement techniques that are deemed appropriate. The correct determination of impairment indicators, as well as the estimates to determine impairment losses, depend on factors that may change over time, affecting the evaluations and estimates made by Directors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The type established by the Company is a cash flow hedge in order to offset the risk of changes in interest expense for the loan covered by the hedge, converting the loan to a fixed interest rate. The hedge was created through agreeing an interest rate swap contract, against which the Company receives an indexed variable interest rate and expiry and time periods in line with the hedged loan and paying a fixed interest rate. The efficacy, measured periodically, is verified with the perfect hedge derivative method. Changes in the fair value of the derivative are calculated based on the methods utilised for prospective or retrospective assessment of efficacy in the hedging report and are compared with the changes in the fair value of a similar derivative instrument. The hedging is considered effective when the differential between the changes of the fair value of the derivative and the changes of the value of the hypothetical derivative is between 80% and 125%.

The adoption of these amendments had no impact on the Group’s financial statements for the year. With reference to impairment, the new standard requires that the estimate of losses on receivables must be implemented on the basis of the model of expected losses (and not the model of incurred losses utilised by IAS 39) by using supportable information that is available without unreasonable charges or efforts and which include historical, current or forecasted data. The standard requires that this impairment model be applicable to all financial instruments, i.e. to financial assets measured at their amortised cost as well as those measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, receivables deriving from rental contracts and trade receivables. Finally, the standard introduces a new model of hedge accounting in order to adjust the requirements needed by the current IAS 39, which are occasionally considered too strict and unsuitable to reflect the risk management policies of companies. The primary novelties within the document include the following: - an increase in the type of transactions eligible for hedge accounting, even including the risks of non-financial assets/liabilities which are eligible to be managed in hedge accounting; - a change in the modalities for booking forward contracts and options when these are included in a hedge accounting relationship and in order to reduce the volatility of the income statement; - changes to the efficacy test through the replacement of the current modalities based on the 80-125% parameter with the principle of the “economic relationship” between the hedged item and hedging instrument; in addition, an evaluation of the retrospective efficacy of the hedging relationship will no longer be requested. The increased flexibility of the new accounting rules is counterbalanced by additional requests for reporting on the risk management activities of the Group. Based on the analyses performed, the Directors expect that the application of IFRS 9 will not have a significant impact on the amounts as well as on the related information reported within the Group’s financial statements for the year. - a worsening in the net financial position (NFP) due to the increase in financial liabilities; - a worsening in pre-tax profit deriving from amortisation/depreciation and financial charges (higher in the first years of lease contracts). financial statements before the recognition of the related assets, costs or revenue. This document gives indication on how the entity should determine the date of a transaction and therefore the spot exchange rate to be used when transactions in foreign currency are carried out, in which the payment is made or received in advance. The interpretation clarifies that the transaction date is the earlier between: a) the date in which the advanced payment or the payment on account received are recorded in the entity’s financial statements; b) the date in which the assets, the cost or the revenue (or part of the same) is recorded in the financial statements (with consequent reverse of the advanced payment or the payment on account received). In the event of a number of advances or payments on account received, a transaction date must be identified for each of these transactions. IFRIC 22 is applicable as from January 1, 2018.

The standard establishes a new model for revenue recognition which will be applied to all contracts stipulated with customers, with the exception of those falling within the realm of application of other IAS/IFRS standards such as leasing, insurance and financial instrument contracts. The fundamental steps for booking revenues according to the new model are as follows: - identification of the contract with the customer; - identification of the performance obligations of the contract; - price determination; - allocation of the price to the performance obligations of the contract; - criteria for registration of the revenue when the entity satisfies each performance obligation. The standard can be applied as from January 1, 2018.

The document includes the results of the IASB project, aimed at superseding the IAS 39 standard. The new standard should be applied by the financial statements as of January 1, 2018 or subsequent years. The standard introduces new criteria for the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. In particular, and in the case of financial assets, the new standard utilises a unique approach based on the modalities for management of financial instruments and on the characteristics of contractual cash flows of the financial assets themselves in order to determine the valuation criterion, thereby replacing the various rules provided for by IAS 39. In the case of financial liabilities, on the other hand, the primary modification concerned the booking of changes in the fair value of a financial liability classified as a financial liability and measured at fair value in the income statement in the case that these changes were due to a change in the credit rating of the issuer of the liability itself. According to the new standard, these changes must be booked in “Other comprehensive income” and no longer in the income statement. Moreover, in the event of non- substantial modifications of liabilities, it is no longer allowed to spread the economic effects of renegotiation over the residual duration of the payable, by modifying the effective interest rate at that date, and the related effect will have to be recognised in the income statement.

The new standard provides a new definition of lease and introduces a criterion based on control (right of use) of a good in order to distinguish leasing contracts from service contracts while identifying the following as discriminating factors: identification of the good, the right of replacement of the latter, the right to substantially obtain all the economic benefits deriving from the use of the good and the right to manage the use of the good underlying the contract. The standard provides for a single model for the recognition and measurement of leasing contracts for the lessee and which includes the booking of the assets also subject to an operating lease under assets and with an offsetting item equal to a financial payable, thereby providing for the possibility of not recognizing contracts, which involve low-value assets, as well as leases with a contractual duration equal to or less than 12 months, as leasing contracts.

The amendments introduced envisage that in the sale or conferment of an asset or a subsidiary to a joint venture or associated company, the measurement of a profit or loss to be recognised in the financial statements of the transferring/ receiving company will depend on whether the assets or the subsidiary sold or conferred represent a business, as envisaged by IFRS 3.

The transfer of the two contracts was formalised with Notary Deed of February 23, 2017, in particular: - the contract no. 890731 envisages instalments to be paid for the principal of Euro 4.1 million, in addition to interest of Euro 0.5 million and the redemption price of Euro 0.1 million. The balance of the last instalment is envisaged on December 23, 2023; - the contract no. 890732 envisages instalments to be paid for the principal of Euro 4.1 million, in addition to interest of Euro 0.5 million and the redemption price of Euro 0.1 million. The balance of the last instalment is envisaged on December 23, 2023. Pursuant to IAS 17, the two properties under finance leases are recorded at cost under tangible fixed assets, with a counter-entry in the financial payable to the lessor, and are depreciated according to the useful life of the asset and consistently with the nature of the individual asset. The financial charge is incurred in the income statement for the duration of the contract. The increase in “Industrial and commercial equipment”, equal to Euro 5.2 million, mainly relates to the purchase of new hardware for in-house use. Decreases, equal to Euro 0.2 million, less the related accumulated depreciation, are due to the sale, scrapping and/or donation of obsolete and/or fully depreciated computers, the depreciation portion for the year and the negative balance of exchange differences that are substantially attributable to the depreciation of the Brazilian Real compared to the Euro.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The benchmark rate for measurements is the one used by the Banca IMI at end 2017; - Debt cost: equal to 1%, the average indebtedness cost (long and short term) of the Group; - Beta unlevered: equal to 1; - Long Term Growth (“g rate”): equal to 0.5%; As recommended by the best practice, the component of the Terminal Value was limited to a maximum of 70% of the total sum of the discounted “free cash flow” and the Terminal Value itself. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the increase in the 1% discount rate. This analysis highlighted no impairment losses. To this purpose, it is worth noting that, to determine the WACC, the following was used: - Risk free rate: equal to 2% when the gross yield of 5-year BTPs is equal to 0.90% - Equity Risk Premium: equal to the Euro Stoxx one (6.30%), compared to the one for Italy (5.50%). The recoverability of trademark value is also confirmed, with respect to other hypotheses, also taking account of a “g rate” growth rate equal to 0%. As already specified, within the context of the Purchase Price Allocation, the Customer relationship was also determined as per income assessment discounted by the prospective residual margins resulting from specific contracts of the Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. Group. The value was determined through an income assessment discounted by the prospective residual margins resulting from specific contracts of the Parent Company Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. and some of its subsidiaries. In particular, in determining the fair value of the customer relationship, cash flows were discounted.

Specifically: - in the finance area, a solution named “CPM Corporate Performance Management” is being implemented. The project envisages a cost of around Euro 1.5 million and its completion is expected within the 2nd half of 2018; - in the Health area, a System to support processes in intensive care units, named “ICU Intensive Care Unit”, is being implemented.

The investment, totalling around Euro 2.1 million, was completed at the beginning of 2018 and will start to be amortised over a period of five years. The product “Net@2A” is also being implemented. This is a new product for the management of the integrated water service and the environmental hygiene service in view of a Cloud Service. The total investment was estimated in around Euro 2 million. - the increase of Euro 4.3 million of item “Other intangible assets” is mainly attributable to the allocation, at the acquisition date of control (January 2017), of the price paid for the Dekra Italia S.r.l. Business Unit, as detailed in paragraph 1.2 herein. In particular, the Performance Management Business Unit, was purchased from the company Dekra Italia S.r.l., operating in the field of managerial consultancy services through applications and technological platforms.

The method used to estimate the value of the trademark was chosen by taking account of the purposes of the transaction and the features of the intangible asset itself. In particular, in line with the literature and the best professional practice, the value of the trademark owned by Engineering was determined by using the income-based method, based on the discounting of future benefits attributable to the intangible asset subject to value appraisal. The income-based method was applied to the version known as the RFR method (Relief from Royalties Method). Royalties were calculated as a percentage of revenues associated to the Plan prepared by the Company’s management in relation to the 2016-2031 period. For the royalty rate valuation, the EBIT margin related to each year of the Plan (royalty rate equal to 2.32%) was considered. Moreover, a scenario was assessed by applying the 25 per cent rule to a measure of central tendency of analysts’ best estimates with respect to the estimated values of applicable EBIT margins related to the sector Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. operates. The discount rate used to assess the value of the trademark is equal to 6.85% . The growth rate over the long period is equal to 2.0% . The trademark is a right which is legally protected through the registration at the competent Authorities. By reason of the fact that this right has no legal, contract, competitive or economic term which limits its useful life, the same is classified as indefinite life intangible asset and therefore it is not amortised but it is subject to impairment loss when tested for impairment, as provided for by IAS 36. Based on the tests carried out according to the methods described above and according to special modalities described hereunder, the value of the trademark tested for impairment was deemed as adequately supported in terms of expected economic results and related cash flows. Therefore, there is no evidence at the present date for the Company to proceed with any write-down. It should be noted that the recoverable value of the trademark was prudently estimated and in compliance with the relevant accounting standard and in line with IFRS measurement practices. The recoverable value—the “value in use” of the trademark—was obtained through discounting of cash flows (DCF Model) over a five-year timing, based on the 2018 budget and assumptions for the following years made by the related Management. The Terminal Value was estimated by using the perpetual annuity, applying the growth rate (“g rate”), which does not exceed the long-term growth estimates of the sector and the Country where Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. operates. The determination of the discount rate referred to the Capital Assets Pricing Model, one of the most accredited methods in literature and professional best practice, based on indicators and parameters that can be observed on the market. In determining the “value in use” the following elements have therefore been taken into account: a) estimates of future cash flows generated by the entity; b) expected possible changes in these cash flows in terms of the amount and time periods; c) cost of money, comprising the current market risk-free rate of interest; d) cost to assume the risk related to implicit uncertainty in the management of the Company; e) other risk factors concerning the operations of a specific market and changes over time.

Therefore, there is no evidence at the present date for the Company to proceed with any write-down. It should be noted that the recoverable value of the CGUs was prudently estimated and in compliance with the relevant accounting standard and in line with IFRS measurement practices. The recoverable value—the “value in use” of the CGUs—was obtained through discounting of cash flows (DCF Model) over the four-year timing for each single CGU, based on the 2018 budget and assumptions for the following years made by the related Management. The Terminal Value was estimated by using the perpetual annuity, applying the growth rate (“g rate”), which does not exceed the long-term growth estimates of the sector and the Country where the CGU operates. The determination of the discount rate referred to the Capital Assets Pricing Model, one of the most accredited methods in literature and professional best practice, based on indicators and parameters that can be observed on the market. In determining the “value in use” the following elements have therefore been taken into account: a) estimates of future cash flows generated by the entity; b) expected possible changes in these cash flows in terms of the amount and time periods; c) cost of money, comprising the current market risk-free rate of interest; d) cost to assume the risk related to implicit uncertainty in the management of the CGU; e) other risk factors concerning the operations of a specific market and changes over time.

The parameters utilised for discounting the cash flows and the Terminal Value under the DCF model illustrated above were as follows: - Risk free rate: equal to 2%, rate used by Banca IMI (former Corporate Broking of Engineering until delisting) at end of 2017 (Annexes Equity Risk Premium 2017); - Equity Risk Premium: equal to 6.30%, the higher yield estimated from the (share) investment market, compared to an investment in risk-free debt securities. The benchmark rate for measurements is the one used by the Banca IMI at end 2017; - Debt cost: equal to 1%, the average indebtedness cost (long and short term) of the Group; - Beta unlevered: equal to 1; - Long Term Growth (“g rate”): equal to 0.5%. As recommended by the best practice, the component of the Terminal Value was limited to a maximum of 70% of the total sum of the discounted “free cash flow” and the Terminal Value itself. Moreover, for all CGUs a sensitivity analysis was performed on the increase in the 1% discount rate. This analysis highlighted no impairment losses. To this purpose, it is worth noting that, to determine the WACC, the following was used: - Risk free rate: equal to 2% when the gross yield of 5-year BTPs is equal to 0.90%; - Equity Risk Premium: equal to the Euro Stoxx one (6.30%), compared to the one for Italy (5.50%). As a consequence, the approach used included parameters of absolute prudence by using a high WACC, compared to Group characteristics. The recoverability of goodwill is also confirmed, with respect to other hypotheses, also taking account of a “g rate” growth rate equal to 0%. F-309 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

Increases of the provision, over the year, take account of non-payment risks related to overdue receivables and receivables in relation to which legal proceedings are in course to redeem full recognition for the Group. It is noted that, as of December 31, 2017, the Group factored trade receivables for the total amount of Euro 191.4 million (Euro 64.2 million as of December 31, 2016). Risks and benefits related to receivables were transferred to the transferee. Receivables were therefore written off from the assets in the consolidated statement of financial position, according to the consideration received by factoring companies. Receivables from customers include the exposure as of December 31, 2017, with respect to Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. (former Sicilia e-Servizi S.p.A. or “SISE”), equal to Euro 127,840,671 (net of the doubtful debt provision amounting to Euro 11,198,406 and provision for interest in arrears amounting to Euro 33,910,922), in addition to Euro 14,526,757 of construction contracts, were related to the IT activities connected with the building of an integrated IT platform for the Sicilian Region within specifications and provisions set out in the convention signed between the Sicilian Region, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Sicilia e-Servizi Venture S.c.a.r.l. in liquidation (“SISEV” or “Venture”) on May 21, 2007 and expired on December 22, 2013. In the mutual interest, on October 9, 2012 SISEV, the Sicilian Region and Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. signed an “Agreement” which regulated the repayment of SISEV receivables, indicating the final repayment date on December 31, 2013. Moreover, this agreement outlined that the Sicilian Region was undertaking to carry out controls and provide Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. with all the technical and economic means, so as the latter would have been able to correctly fulfil its obligations, and envisaged that, while executing the agreement, such obligations would have been undertaken by SISEV. Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and the Sicilian Region fulfilled their obligations only partially as to the receivable refunding plan, as envisaged by the agreement, although no objections were arisen with respect to the correct performance of services rendered. Given the non payments of Sicilia Digitale S.p.A., on June 26, 2013, SISEV filed a petition for an order of payment before the Court of Palermo against Sicilia Digitale S.p.A., and obtained the payment order for Euro 30,051,530.90 (in addition to interests, expenses and remunerations, VAT and CPA), for which, however, no execution order was given. Moreover, Sicilia Digitale asked, and on October 2, 2013 obtained the provisional execution of the payment order for Euro 93,163,203 with respect to the Sicilian Region. Following the sale by SISEV of the entire shareholding to the Sicilian Region, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. unjustifiably left the lawsuit started by the previous Director to obtain the payment of the aforesaid amount from the Sicilian Region. Therefore, to safeguard its rights, on July 18, 2014 SISEV applied for a distraint order over all receivables from the Sicilian Region to Sicilia e-Servizi S.p.A., up to the entire amounts receivable accrued by the company. On November 10, 2014, the Court of Palermo rejected SISEV’s request while underlying that “given that, _besides Sicilia Digitale S.p.A., also the Sicilian Region (via its accountant general), an undoubtedly solvent entity, is directly committed with respect to Sicilia Digitale Venture S.c.r.l. -... Omitted ... there is no urgency (periculum in mora) ...”. In other words, the Judge reported no credit risk, while highlighting the “guarantor” role_ played by the Sicilian Region in favour of SISEV.

1596_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,3075,•** **4.26 RELATED PARTIES,3075.90,Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 13 Trade receivables (Continued),3075.90.1,,"To this purpose, it should be noted that, as regards SISE’s judgement of opposition to the first order decree, deposited on September 3, 2013, obtained in the amount of around Euro 30,052 thousand, the Judge ordered an Office Technical Expertise aimed at evaluating, inter alia, the actual services rendered by SISEV, which are related to the invoicing subject to the order of payment. On December 17, 2016, the Office Technical Experts, designated for the assessment of the actual performance by Venture of services that are related to the invoicing object of the payment order, transmitted to the parties a first draft of the expertise where a total amount receivable of Euro 28,067,526.11 was assessed in favour of Venture. Therefore, almost the entire amount claimed in Court was assessed by experts (taking account that in the arrears some payments were received by Venture and today the receivables in question were equal to Euro 28,346,051.66). On that date, the experts committee was established. At the time of the final assessment, the experts acknowledged that the amount of the services rendered and described in the deeds was almost the entire amount object of the payment order (less payments received in the meantime). Following a request of integration by the Judge, the experts therefore issued and lodged the supplementary expertise (in which the assets object of the payment claim were divided according to the existence or non-existence of approvals by the Management of SISE and/or the Region). The Court suspended the decision. Moreover, on February 18, 2016, SISEV sent a writ of summons to obtain the payment of the entire amount of receivables (around Euro 79,675 thousand, including the works recognised in the financial statements to complete the amount already requested with an appeal for an order of payment) as the company deems, as already stated, that these amounts were correctly originated and are correctly payable, also pursuant to provisions contained in the trilateral agreement signed on October 9, 2012 by the Sicilian Region, Sicilia e Servizi S.p.A. and SISEV. Both parties, i.e. the Sicilian Region and Sicilia e Servizi S.p.A., appeared and filed objections including, but not limited to, the fact that the measure dated October 9, 2012 was invalid, the service contracts and related orders were null and void, Venture unfulfilled its know-how transfer obligations. The parties also filed a claim for damages for a total amount of Euro 95,643 thousand. These plaintiff’s claims were objected at the first hearing of June 8, 2016. After filing the pre-trial briefs, the Judge reserved on the ruling of all claims submitted, including but not limited to, evidence by SISEV based on documents and expertises. With respect to the request expressed by the Sicilian Region, SISEV continued and still continues to render the services on a reduced basis and with the exclusive intent to avert the total interruption of the services to citizens, despite the Framework Convention has expired. Within the aforesaid context, no specific critical issues or formal claims related to the correct execution of services and good quality of products delivered by SISEV were highlighted by Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and/or the Sicilian Region. Moreover, the above-mentioned claims do not seem prima facie suited to stop the aggregate claims of SISEV. To date, it is therefore deemed that the defence of the summoned parties are not such to affect the evaluation on the collectability of receivables in favour of SISEV. Given the correctness of credit lines and the correct execution of services, despite the favourable opinion of the legal advisers on the entire collectability of the receivables in question, within the above-mentioned context, after acknowledging, among other, the continuous change in institutional interlocutors and the difficulty in achieving an amicable agreement, in view of a legal dispute and of the objections filed in by SISE and the Sicilian Region, in its financial statements SISEV recognised the interest set out by law pertaining to the year (around Euro 3.8 million) in the income statement and under item Financial income, in addition to the amount already recognised until December 31, 2016 (for a total amount of around Euro 30 million) and allocated an amount of around Euro 4.1 million to the doubtful debt provision, in addition to the total amount of around Euro 40.9 million already allocated to the doubtful debt provision in the previous year. The latter included the total impairment of the aforesaid interest set out by law and recognised in the financial statements and, for the remaining portion, the impairment of the nominal value of the receivable, resulting from an estimate made after a careful evaluation of all information currently available.

In particular, the minority shareholders of a subsidiary acquire the right to exercise a sales option of their shares to Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. in special cases, as defined in the agreement signed by the parties. The price to exercise the option is fixed based on economic parameters and adequately valued multipliers. The fair value of liabilities, which represents a reasonable estimate of the exercise price for the option, was determined based on contract terms set out in the related contract, by using the parameters that are inferable from the 2019-2021 plan of the subsidiary involved. The liabilities related to the aforesaid payables, measured at fair value are classified as Level 3 (i.e. financial liabilities the fair value of which is determined not according to observable market data).

Post-employment benefits, accrued after January 1, 2007, represent a “defined contribution plan”. Periodically the Company pays post-employment benefits accrued to a separate entity (e.g. INPS and/or a Fund) with the payment fulfilling obligations toward employees. For accounting purposes, it is included under other contributions, as Post-employment benefit matured is recorded as a cost in the period with the payable recognised under short-term payables. Post-employment benefits accrued up to December 31, 2006 continue to represent a “defined benefit plan” which is more certain in terms of their existence and sum, but uncertain in terms of manifestation. The total amount of the benefit obligation is calculated and certified on an annual basis by an independent actuary by using the “Projected Unit Credit” method. A summary of the actuarial assumptions adopted in measuring Post-employment benefits is provided below. Financial assumptions: - future annual rates of inflation were set according to the average rates of inflation in Italy in recent years, based on ISTAT data; - annual revaluation of existing provisions and subsequent payments fixed, as established by regulations at 75% of the inflation rate plus 1.50% net of taxes; - the annual discount rate was established as variable from 0.3122% to 1.7179 % and was deducted adopting a rate curve combining the effective yield rates movements of the Euro Bonds of primary companies with AA rating or higher. Demographic assumptions: - to evaluate length of employment with the Company, the “Tavola di permanenza nella posizione di attivo” RG48 (a table for company service length prepared by the Italian Treasury Department based on data for those born in 1948) was used, selected, projected and separated by gender, supplemented with the probability of additional reasons for departure (resignations, advances which are a financialbased cause for leaving, measurable in terms of probability). The following tables show the absolute and relative changes in liabilities measured according to IAS 19 (DBO), while assuming a 10% negative or positive change in the revaluation and/or discounting rates.",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

It should be noted that, the item “Other personnel costs” also include the cost of Euro 9.4 million related to the Stock Options plan. On June 28, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a stock option plan addressed to employees, consultants, collaborators and Directors of the Company and the Group companies controlled by the same and aimed at being an incentive for Group growth commitments and obtaining loyalty from beneficiaries. This is a stock option plan for the shares of the Company Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A.. Within this plan, 911,759 options are assigned, for free, to beneficiaries. The options, when exercisable, give the right to subscribe one share each (of special B class), corresponding to 7.5% of the share capital, before a dedicated increase. The options are divided in three pools: the first pool, including 897,718 options, and the second and third pool, of equal number of options, for the residual amount. The exercise price of each option, being part of the first pool, is equal to Euro 42.15 each, while the exercise price of each option included in the second and third pool will be instead determined by the Board of Directors, on an annual basis, according to the Company’s “Market Fair Value” at the date of price determination. The options become exercisable provided that determined time and performance objectives be achieved (so-called vested options). These options can be exercised only starting from the notification of the expiry term of the plan and not later than the business day prior to the expiry term of the plan. The exercise of the options is also subordinated to the occurrence of a disinvestment (i.e. the transfer of quotes and shares representing more than 50% of the subscribed and paid capital of Engineering, Newco or Holdco; the transfer of all Group assets; the admission to trade on a regulated market) and will be effective upon completion of the same at the expiry date of the plan. Shares are available to the beneficiary at the expiry date of the plan. At the expiry date of the plan, the Board of Directors has the faculty to pay the beneficiary the difference between i) the Market Fair Value of shares assigned to the beneficiary and ii) the exercise price. In that case, the beneficiary will not have the right to claim the issue of shares and options assigned to him will no longer be valid. Despite the fact that the Board of Directors is vested with the power to choose between the payment in cash and the issue of equity instruments, the Directors deem that, at the balance-sheet date, the Company does not have any current obligations for cash payment. Therefore, the plan was accounted for as share-based payment transaction. F-334 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,725

The Company has the right to ask the beneficiary to repay the minimum amount sufficient to cover tax charges set out by law. The fair value of rights assigned during 2017 was calculated, upon assignment, by using the binomial model to evaluate US options (so-called Cox, Ross and Rubinstein model). It totalled Euro 9.4 million (the fair value of options granted in the first pool amounted to Euro 12.18 per option). The fair value of rights assigned during 2017 was calculated on the spot. In particular, the main input data used to measure the fair value of the Stock Option plan are summarised as follows: - multiple of EV/EBITDA, determined as mean of a panel of listed comparable values; - interest rate curve btp 3 years as of December 31, 2017; - historical volatility AT 260 days, observed as of December 31, 2017; - dividend yield equal to zero for the stock grant measurement; - historical series of logarithmic yields for the securities involved; - liquidity discount equal to 20%; - strike price equal to Euro 42.15, contractually determined. The fair value of options granted in the first pool amounted to Euro 12.18 per option. The fair value at the assignment date was determined independently and based on the following parameters for the options granted: - options are granted free; - options accrued are exercisable; - the exercise price is Euro 0; - the concession time is 4 years; - the exercise price for each share at the assignment date is Euro 42.15.

The Group has adopted the IFRS International Accounting Standards since the 2005 financial year. Pursuant to Article 2409-septies of the Italian Civil Code, the Board also states that they exchanged information with the Group’s Independent Auditors, Deloitte & Touche S.p.A The financial statements of each subsidiary are reported as regularly approved by the related Boards and audited within the limits and pursuant to modalities envisaged by the audit plan defined by the Independent Auditors.

The criteria adopted by the Board of Directors, duly described in the Explanatory Notes on the consolidated financial statements, as well as in the financial statements valuations and value adjustments, are based on the general and usual criteria adopted on a going concern basis.
