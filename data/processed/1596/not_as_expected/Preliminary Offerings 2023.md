The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission
and consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls any Initial Purchaser, the
Issuer, the Guarantors (each as defined in the Offering Memorandum) or any of their respective

any version that will be provided to you at a later date upon your request from any Initial Purchaser.

**MiFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for**
the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process of the Notes, the target market assessment
in respect of the securities described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the
target market for such securities is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each
as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of
such securities to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to the Issuer’s obligations in
accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA Retail Investors: The securities described in the Offering Memorandum**
are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold, distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129 (as amended or superseded, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the securities or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the securities
or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in any
Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from
the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities. The Offering Memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target** **market: Solely for**
the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the securities described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target
market for such securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of
Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients only, as defined in Regulation (EU) No
600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
(“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such
securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance
Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to UK Retail Investors: The securities described in the Offering Memorandum**
are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,


-----

sold, distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”).
For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined
in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive
(EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA;
or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK
PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the securities or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering, selling or distributing
the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under
the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will
be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK
Prospectus Regulation.

**The Offering Memorandum is being distributed for information purposes only and is subject to**
**completion and amendment (which may be material) without notice. The definitive terms of the**
**transaction will be described in the final version of the Offering Memorandum. The Offering**
**Memorandum shall not, and is not intended to, constitute or contain any offer or invitation to sell**
**or the solicitation of any offer to buy and may not be used as, or in connection with, any offer or**
**invitation to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy any of the securities described therein.**

**€385.0 million    % Senior Secured Notes due 2028**

Centurion Bidco S.p.A., a joint stock company (società per azioni) incorporated under the laws of Italy (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) €      million in aggregate principal amount
of its    % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Notes”). The gross proceeds from the Offering will be used, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i) repay in full and cancel the indebtedness
incurred under the Bridge Facility (as defined herein), including accrued interest thereon, and (ii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Offering and the Bridge Facility Refinancing (as
defined herein). The amounts drawn under the Bridge Facility were used by the Issuer, together with a portion of the proceeds from the Sellers’ Reinvestment (as defined herein) and cash on
balance sheet, directly or indirectly, to fund the Be Acquisition (as defined herein) and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the Be Acquisition and the entry into and drawing of the
Bridge Facility, as described in more detail herein. See “Summary—The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.”
The Notes will bear interest at a rate of % per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on each of and, commencing on, 2023. The Notes will mature on     , 2028.
Prior to, 2025, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or any portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to,
but excluding, the date of redemption, and Additional Amounts, if any, plus a “make whole” premium. In addition, prior to, 2025, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes originally issued (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Notes issued) in each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued
and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, and Additional Amounts, if any. Furthermore, prior to, 2025, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the original principal amount
of the Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this Offering Memorandum, provided that, inter alia, at least 50% of the original principal amount of the
Notes remains outstanding. At any time on or after, 2025, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum.
In addition, in the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may elect to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any. In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for any series of Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw the Notes of such series in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in
lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders of Notes, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that
remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes in such offer. See “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption.” Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase all the outstanding Notes, at a purchase price equal to_
101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”
The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and
will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Existing Notes (as defined herein), the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility (as defined herein) and the Existing Term Loan (as defined herein). Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein)
and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Notes will be guaranteed (the “Guarantees” and, each a “Guarantee”) on a senior secured basis by the Company (as defined
herein) and Overlord Bidco (together, the “Guarantors”). The Guarantees will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the relevant Guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness that is not
subordinated to such Guarantee, and will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that does not guarantee the
Notes. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Company also guarantees the Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Notes,
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Term Loan, and Overlord Bidco guarantees the Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, in each case, on a senior
secured basis. Upon completion of (x) the Engineering Merger (as defined herein), if any, MergerCo (as defined herein) will assume the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Guarantee
of the Notes by the Company is expected to be released and (y) the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger (as defined herein), if any, the Guarantee of the Notes by Overlord Bidco will be released.
In addition, upon completion of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, Overlord Bidco will no longer be a separate legal entity, and therefore the Overlord Funding Loan II (as defined herein),
and any security interest granted in respect of it, will cease to exist. The pledge on the shares of Overlord Bidco held by the Company (or MergerCo, following the Engineering Merger) will also
cease to exist as a result of such merger, and the Notes will instead be secured by a pledge to be granted within ten Business Days of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger on all the shares of
Be or the entity resulting from the Be-Be Opco Merger (as the case may be) held by the Company (or MergerCo, following the Engineering Merger).
On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Initial Collateral (as defined herein). Within 30 days
from (and excluding) the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Post-Issue Date Collateral; provided that if
the Engineering Merger becomes effective prior to the date on which the Post-Issue Date Collateral has been granted, the Notes (x) will not be secured by the Post-Issue Date Collateral and (y)
will instead be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral within the later of 30 days from (and excluding)
the Issue Date and ten Business Days from (and excluding) the Engineering Merger Date. Within ten Business Days from (and excluding) the Engineering Merger Date (as defined herein), the
Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral (as defined herein). Subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, the Initial Collateral and the Post-Issue Date Collateral also secure, and following the Engineering Merger, the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral will secure, the Issuer’s obligations
under, the Existing Notes, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations (if any) and the Existing Term Loan on a pari passu basis. Each of the Initial Collateral, the PostIssue Date Collateral and the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral is further described under “Description of the Notes—Security.” Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined
herein) and subject to applicable laws, the holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral (x) only after the lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full and (y) on a pari passu basis with the holders of the Existing Notes and the lender under the Existing Term
Loan. In addition, subject to applicable laws, the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, and to applicable laws, the Collateral may be pledged to secure future indebtedness. The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain material limitations
pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” See
also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Once granted, the Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and
_may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility_
_Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_
This Offering Memorandum includes more detailed information on the terms of the Notes and the Guarantees, including redemption and repurchase prices, security, covenants, events of default
and transfer restrictions. Subject to and as set forth in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer will not be liable to pay any Additional Amounts to holders of the Notes in
relation to any withholding or deduction required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996, as amended or supplemented from time to time (“Decree No. 239”), if the Notes
are held by a person resident in a country that is not included in the list issued under Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239, and otherwise in the circumstances as described in “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes.”_
There is currently no market for the Notes. This Offering Memorandum constitutes a prospectus for purposes of Part IV of the Luxembourg law on prospectuses for securities dated July 16,
2019. Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and to admit the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market.

not constitute an offer of any securities other than those to which it relates or an offer to sell, or a
solicitation of an offer to buy, to any person in any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation would
be unlawful.

This Offering Memorandum contains summaries, believed to be accurate, of some of the terms of
specific documents, but reference is made to the actual documents, copies of some of which will be
made available upon request, for the complete information contained in those documents. By receiving
this Offering Memorandum, investors acknowledge that they have had an opportunity to request for
review, and have received, all additional information they deem necessary to verify the accuracy and
completeness of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Investors also acknowledge
that they have not relied on the Initial Purchasers in connection with their investigation of the accuracy
of this information or their decision whether to invest in the Notes. The contents of this Offering
Memorandum are not to be considered legal, business, financial, investment, tax or other advice.
Prospective investors should consult their own counsel, accountants and other advisors as to legal,
business, financial, investment, tax and other aspects of a purchase of the Notes. In making an
investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the
Company and any of their respective affiliates, the terms of the Offering and the merits and risks
involved.

In addition, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules and regulations of the
Exchange so require, the Issuer will also provide a copy of the foregoing information and reports to the
Exchange.

This Offering is being made outside the United States in reliance upon exemptions from registration
under the Securities Act for an offer and sale of securities that does not involve a public offering. The
Notes have not been registered with, recommended by or approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission or any other U.S. federal, state or foreign securities commission or regulatory authority,
nor has any such commission or regulatory authority reviewed or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy
of this Offering Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw this Offering at any time and to reject any
commitment to subscribe for the Notes, in whole or in part. The Initial Purchasers also reserve the right
to allot less than the full amount of Notes sought by investors. The Initial Purchasers and certain related
entities may acquire a portion of the Notes for their own accounts. Persons into whose possession this
Offering Memorandum or any of the Notes come must inform themselves about, and observe any
restrictions on, the transfer and exchange of the Notes. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Notice to
_Investors.”_

The laws of certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and the
offer and sale of the Notes. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum or any of the
Notes come must inform themselves about, and observe, any such restrictions. None of the Issuer, the
Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Security Agent, the Transfer Agent
or their respective representatives are making any representation to any offeree or any purchaser of the


-----

Notes regarding the legality of any investment in the Notes by such offeree or purchaser under
applicable laws or regulations. For a further description of certain restrictions on the Offering and sale
of the Notes and the distribution of the Offering Memorandum, see “Notice to Investors.”

To purchase the Notes, investors must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any
jurisdiction in which investors purchase, offer or sell the Notes or possess or distribute this Offering
Memorandum. Investors must also obtain any consent, approval or permission required by such
jurisdiction for investors to purchase, offer or sell any of the Notes under the laws and regulations in
force in any jurisdiction to which investors are subject. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Security Agent, the Transfer Agent or their respective
affiliates will have any responsibility therefor.

Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers are making an Offering in any jurisdiction where the
Offering is not permitted. No action has been taken by the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer, the Guarantors,
or any other person that would permit an Offering or the circulation or distribution of this Offering
Memorandum or any offering material in relation to the Issuer, the Guarantors, or any of the Notes in
any country or jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required.

The Notes will only be issued in fully registered form and in denominations of €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be
deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear SA/NV
(“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) and registered in the name of the nominee
of the common depositary. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

The information contained under the headings “Summary,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry and Market Overview” and “Business”_
includes extracts from information and data, including industry and market data, prepared by third
parties. While the Issuer accepts responsibility for the accurate extraction and summarization of such
information and data, the Issuer has not independently verified the accuracy of such information and
data and accepts no further responsibility in respect thereof. However, as far as the Issuer and the
Company are aware, no information or data has been omitted which would render reproduced
information inaccurate or misleading.

The information set forth in those sections of this Offering Memorandum describing clearing and
settlement is subject to any change or reinterpretation of the rules, regulations and procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream currently in effect. Investors wishing to use these clearing systems are
advised to confirm the continued applicability of their rules, regulations and procedures. None of the
Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will have
any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of,
book-entry interests held through the facilities of any clearing system or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing any records relating to such book-entry interests.

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Exchange and to admit them for trading on the
Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application for admission of the Notes on the Exchange
will be approved or that such listing will be maintained and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned
on obtaining this listing.

MANAGER”) (OR PERSONS ACTING ON ITS BEHALF), MAY OVER-ALLOT NOTES OR

NOTES AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT WHICH MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE PREVAIL FOR
A LIMITED PERIOD AFTER THE ISSUE DATE. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO OBLIGATION ON


-----

THE STABILIZATION MANAGER (OR PERSONS ACTING ON ITS BEHALF) TO DO THIS.
SUCH STABILIZATION, IF COMMENCED, MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME AND
MUST BE BROUGHT TO AN END NO LATER THAN THE EARLIER OF 30 CALENDAR DAYS
AFTER THE ISSUE DATE AND 60 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THE

**NOTICE TO U.S. INVESTORS**

None of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission or any other
regulatory authority has approved or disapproved the Notes or the Guarantees, and none of the foregoing
authorities have passed upon or endorsed the merits of the Offering or the accuracy or adequacy of this
Offering Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary could be a criminal offence in certain
jurisdictions.

The Notes may only be offered and sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. Each
purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and
acknowledgements that are described in this Offering Memorandum under “Notice to Investors.” The
Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any
state of the United States, and the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on transfer. For a description
of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer of the Notes, see “Notice to Investors.”

**CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING SALES INTO CANADA**

The Notes may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal, that
are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection
73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the
Notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
prospectus requirements of applicable securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with
remedies for rescission or damages if this Offering Memorandum (including any amendment thereto)
contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the
purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or
territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the
purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights, or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to Section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the Initial
Purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding
underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this Offering.

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**European Economic Area**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to produce a prospectus
for offers of the Notes. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as
amended or superseded), and includes any relevant implementing measure in each member state (“EU
Member State”) of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”).

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should
only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a
prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do authorize, the


-----

making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial
Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering
Memorandum.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor”
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a
“qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

For the purposes of this section, the expression an “offer of notes to the public” in relation to any Notes
in any EU Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide
to purchase or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that EU Member State by any measure
implementing the Prospectus Regulation in that EU Member State.

Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of each
manufacturer’s approval process of the Notes, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has
led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and
professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes
to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target
market assessment; however, and without prejudice to our obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a
distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect
of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels.

**United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to, and is directed solely at, persons who (i) are
outside the United Kingdom, (ii) are investment professionals, as such term is defined in Article 19(5)
of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the
“Financial Promotion Order”), (iii) are persons falling within Articles 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Financial
Promotion Order or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment
banking activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the
“FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise be lawfully communicated
or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This
Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by
persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering
Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant
persons. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this Offering Memorandum
or any of its contents.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will
be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK
Prospectus Regulation.


-----

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point
(8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive
(EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA;
or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK
PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible
counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product
Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**Italy**

No action has been or will be taken which could allow an offering to the public in the Republic of Italy
within the meaning of Article 1(1)(t) of Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 1998, as subsequently
integrated and amended (the “Italian Financial Act”) and, in particular, the Offering has not been
submitted to the clearance of the Commissione Nazionale per la Società e la Borsa (“CONSOB”) (the
Italian securities exchange commission), pursuant to Italian securities legislation and will not be subject
to review or clearance by CONSOB. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered, sold or delivered,
directly or indirectly, in the Republic of Italy, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other
offering memorandum, prospectus, form of application, advertisement, other offering material or other
documentation relating to the Notes may be issued, distributed or published in the Republic of Italy,
either on the primary or on the secondary market, except: (a) to qualified investors (investitori
_qualificati) as referred to in Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation; or (b) in any other circumstances_
which are exempted from the rules on public offerings pursuant to Article 1 of the Prospectus
Regulation and Article 34-ter, first paragraph of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of May 14, 1999, as
amended (the “Issuer Regulation”) and any other applicable Italian laws and regulations.

The Notes may not be offered, sold or delivered and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other
material relating to the Notes, may be distributed or made available in the Republic of Italy unless such
offer, sale or delivery of Notes or distribution or availability of copies of this Offering Memorandum or
any other offering material or other documentation relating to the Notes in the Republic of Italy is made
in compliance with the selling restrictions above and must be made as follows: (a) by soggetti abilitati
(including investment firms, banks or financial intermediaries, as defined by Article 1, Paragraph 1(r)
of the Italian Financial Act), permitted to conduct such activities in the Republic of Italy in accordance,
as applicable, with Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Italian Banking Act”) as
subsequently integrated and amended, the Italian Financial Act, the Issuer Regulation, CONSOB
Regulation No. 20307 of February 15, 2018, as amended and any other applicable laws and regulations;


-----

and (b) in compliance with all relevant Italian securities, tax and exchange control and other applicable
laws and regulations and any other applicable requirements or limitations which may be imposed from
time to time by CONSOB, the Bank of Italy (including, the reporting requirements, where applicable,
pursuant to Article 129 of the Italian Banking Act and the implementing guidelines of the Bank of Italy,
as amended from time to time) and/or other competent Italian authority. For a further description of
certain restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes and the distribution of this Offering Memorandum
in the Republic of Italy, see “Notice to Investors.”

Any investor purchasing the Notes is solely responsible for ensuring that any offer or resale of the Notes
by such investor occurs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements, including statements about our
strategy, investment program, future operations, industry forecasts, expected acquisitions, transactions
and investments (including the Engineering Acquisition and the Be Acquisition), and target levels of
leverage and indebtedness. Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations, intentions or
forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements include statements about expectations, beliefs,
plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical fact.
Words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,”
“ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” or similar words or phrases, or the
negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these
words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based
on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from
those expected in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in
“Risk Factors.” In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements
contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results
or developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary
from projected future results include, but are not limited to:

- competition from existing or future players in our markets;

- global economic conditions, political events and geopolitical conflicts;

- political and economic uncertainty in Italy;

- technological change;

- regulation of our customers’ industries;

- personal data breaches;

- provision of services to government entities;

- pandemics and other diseases;

- delays in payments by our customers, increase in accounts receivable and in provisions for bad

- failure to protect our intellectual property;

- infringement of intellectual property owned by others;

- investment required by sales efforts;

- ineffectiveness of our cost-saving measures;

- comparability of our results of operation;

- financial information of the Be Group being limited and not subject to review or audit;

- realization of the adjustments to our Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA;

- failure to attract and retain skilled employees and executives;

- loss of members of our senior management;

- insufficient insurance coverage;

- labor disruptions;

- risks associated with operating in several jurisdictions;

- tax laws;

- changes to accounting standards;

- value of our goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets;

- non-controlling shareholders of our subsidiaries;

- revenue generation, cash collection and billing partners;

- inability to obtain or enforcement of bid bonds securities or guarantees required for
participation in public tenders;

- liabilities owed under post-employment benefits;


-----

- other risks associated with the Transactions, our capital structure, the Notes, the Guarantees
and the Security Interests; and

- other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.”

These risks and others described under “Risk Factors” are not exhaustive. Other sections of this
Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our financial position,
results of operations and liquidity. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us
to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to
which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction
of actual results.

Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, and we do
not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set out in this
Offering Memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements
attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in
this Offering Memorandum. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

Statements in this Offering Memorandum regarding the market environment, market developments,
growth rates, market trends and the competitive situation in the markets and segments in which we
operate are based on market data, statistical information, sector reports and third-party studies as well
as on our own estimates. Unless otherwise stated, all industry and market data (including our market
share and market positioning) are to the Issuer and its subsidiaries, and exclude the Be Group.

We operate in an industry in which it is difficult to obtain precise industry and market information. In
drafting this Offering Memorandum, we used industry sources, market research, publicly available
information, industry publications and sources of market data, such as reports prepared by Gartner, Inc.
(“Gartner”), the Anitec-Assinform Italian Association for Information and Communication Technology
(“Anitec-Assinform”), NetConsulting Cube, the Italian National Institute of Statistics (“ISTAT”), the
Statistical Office of the European Union (“EUROSTAT”) and the World Bank and reports prepared by
industry consultants. To the extent that information was taken from third parties, such information has
been accurately reproduced by us in this Offering Memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to
ascertain from the information published by these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would
render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Market studies and analyses are, however,
frequently based on information and assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct, and
their methodology may be forward-looking and speculative. We have not verified the figures, market
data and other information used by third parties in the studies, publications and financial information
reproduced herein, or the external sources on which our estimates are based. We therefore assume no
liability for and offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data from studies and third party sources
contained in this Offering Memorandum or for the accuracy of third party data on which our estimates
are based. Unless otherwise specified, data from studies and third party sources contained or used in
this Offering Memorandum speaks as of its original publication date (and not as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum), and the opinions expressed in any such data are subject to change without
notice.

The Gartner content described herein (the “Gartner Content”) represents research opinion or viewpoints
published, as part of a syndicated subscription service, by Gartner, and are not representations of fact.
Gartner Content speaks as of its original publication date (and not as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum), and the opinions expressed in the Gartner Content are subject to change without notice.
Gartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does
not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.
Gartner research publications consist of the opinions of Gartner’s research organization and should not
be construed as statements of fact. Gartner disclaims all warranties, expressed or implied, with respect
to this research, including any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
GARTNER is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S.
and internationally and is used herein with permission. All rights reserved.

This Offering Memorandum also contains estimates of market data and information derived from such
data that cannot be obtained from publications by independent sources. Such information is partly based
on our own market observations, the evaluation of industry information (such as from conferences and
sector events) or internal assessments. We believe that our estimates of market data and the information
we have derived from such data helps investors to better understand the industry in which we operate
and our position within it. Our own estimates have not been checked or verified externally. While we
assume that our own market observations are reliable, we give no warranty for the accuracy of our own
estimates and the information derived from them. They may differ from estimates made by our
competitors or from other independent sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding
the industry or similar data presented herein, such data involves risks and uncertainties and are subject
to change based on various factors, including those discussed under “Risk Factors” in this Offering
Memorandum.

the initial issue price in the Offering. See “Certain Taxation Considerations.”

**TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES**

The Group owns or has rights to certain trademarks, trade names or service marks that it uses in
connection with the operation of its business. The Group asserts, to the fullest extent under applicable
law, its rights to its trademarks, trade names and service marks. Each trademark, trade name or service

**General**

The Issuer was incorporated on March 20, 2020, in connection with the Engineering Acquisition. As of
the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer is a holding company with no revenue-generating
activities of its own, and no business operations, material assets, other than the shares it holds in the
Company and its receivables under the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loan I, or
material liabilities, other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation, the Engineering
Acquisition and the transactions related thereto, including the Existing Notes, the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility, the Existing Term Loan, the €210.0 million deeply subordinated shareholder loan
granted by TopCo to the Issuer in 2020 in connection with the Engineering Acquisition, and the Bridge
Facility.

As the Company has only been consolidated within the Issuer’s results since July 23, 2020, which was
the Engineering Acquisition Closing Date, in this Offering Memorandum, we present historical
financial information for the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods prior to such date,
and for the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods following such date. Accordingly, unless
otherwise stated, all references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Group” in respect of historical financial
information in this Offering Memorandum are to (i) the Issuer and its subsidiaries, for each of the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and (ii) the Company and its subsidiaries, for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

In particular, this Offering Memorandum includes the English translation of the Issuer’s audited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, which include
comparative unaudited financial data for the year ended December 31, 2021, which have been prepared
in accordance with IFRS (the “2022 Audited Financial Statements”). The 2022 Audited Financial
Statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche S.p.A. and are the only financial statements that
are included in this Offering Memorandum.

This Offering Memorandum also includes certain references to, and financial information derived from,
(i) the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2020, which include comparative financial data for the year ended December 31, 2019, which have
been prepared in accordance with IFRS (the “Company’s 2020 Financial Statements”) and (ii) the
Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021,
which include comparative financial data for the year ended December 31, 2020, which have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS (the “2021 Financial Statements”). The Company’s 2020 Financial
Statements and the 2021 Financial Statements are available on the Issuer’s reporting website but not
included in this Offering Memorandum. The Company’s 2020 Financial Statements, the 2021 Financial
Statements and the financial figures derived therefrom included in this Offering Memorandum are
affected by certain accounting errors, as further described under “—Accounting Errors” below, and
therefore the comparability thereof with financial figures derived from the 2022 Audited Financial
Statements is limited.

Given the different scope of consolidation, the financial results of the Company and the Issuer are not
directly comparable. In particular, the 2021 Financial Statements are not directly comparable to the
Company’s 2020 Financial Statements due to the different scope of consolidation, which resulted,
among other things, in the 2021 Financial Statements also including indebtedness and cash at the level
of the Issuer (including indebtedness under the Existing Notes, the Existing Term Loan, the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, the €210.0 million deeply subordinated shareholder loan granted by TopCo
to the Issuer in 2020 in connection with the Engineering Acquisition, and associated interest payments,
and the Bridge Facility). In addition, we have accounted for the Engineering Acquisition using the
acquisition method of accounting under IFRS 3 - “Business Combinations” and applied purchase
accounting adjustments in connection with the Engineering Acquisition to the Issuer’s consolidated
financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Engineering Acquisition Closing Date.


-----

However, our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the Engineering Acquisition Closing
Date have not been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the impact of any changes to the income
statements, statements of financial position or cash flow statements that occurred as a result of purchase
accounting adjustments applied to the Engineering Acquisition. For a discussion of the most material
differences between the Issuer’s financial information included in the 2021 Financial Statements as
compared to the Company’s financial information included in the Company’s 2020 Financial
Statements, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—The Engineering_
_Acquisition in 2020.” See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Certain_
_line items contained in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the 2021 Financial Statements are_
_not comparable to the corresponding line items included in the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements.”_

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this
Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult
your own professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP
and how those differences could affect the financial information contained in this Offering
Memorandum.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires the board of directors to exercise its judgment in the process of
applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to our financial statements, are disclosed in our 2022
Audited Financial Statements. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations—Accounting Policies.”_

**Accounting Errors**

In September 2022, we became aware of certain discrepancies between budgeted and final financial
data as of August 2022 relating to the Company’s Finance industry vertical and its subsidiary Nexen
(which is part of the Finance industry vertical). As a result of such discrepancies, we initiated a process,
with the assistance from external advisors, in order to verify the accounting methods used for specific
jobs within the Company’s Finance industry vertical and Nexen.

This verification process, which was completed at the end of the fiscal year 2022, identified certain
accounting errors relating to the 2022 fiscal year and previous fiscal years, which resulted in an
overstatement of the Company’s consolidated balance sheet assets and operating profits. On this basis,
management determined that it was necessary to make certain corrections to the financial statements
and applied IAS 8 (Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors), which governs,
among other things, how to recognise and represent errors, including those from previous years.

The verification process concluded that the accounting errors resulted from the allocation of costs in
our internal management system, which mainly led to the recognition of revenues:

(i) relating to jobs that were not supported by any underlying contract, including by allocating to

such jobs costs that were unrelated to them (e.g., costs relating to other existing jobs), and by
recognizing corresponding revenues on our accounting systems; and

(ii) in advance of their accrual period.

As a result of such errors, the Company recorded non-recoverable balance sheet assets in the form of
invoices to be issued and work-in-progress (recognized in the financial statements under current assets
in the item “Customer contract assets”), which could not be and were not invoiced to customers.

Based on the results of the verification process, we quantified the following accounting effects:


-----

(i) an overstatement of the Group’s operating profit and EBITDA for the year ended December

31, 2022, of €10.9 million; and

(ii) an overstatement of the balance sheet assets as of January 1, 2022 of €46.0 million.

Both effects were corrected in our 2022 Audited Financial Statements.

While it was possible to allocate the effects of the accounting errors that occurred during 2022 to the
financial year ended December 31, 2022 due to the availability of current information on the progress
of the Finance industry vertical’s contracts, we were not able to allocate with certainty the €46.0 million
overstatement of balance sheet assets as of January 1, 2022 to any prior periods because of the way our
management systems close out jobs and of the lack of traceability inside the system for such an
accounting error.

With respect to these accounting errors relating to fiscal years prior to 2022, we applied paragraphs 42
to 47 of IAS 8 as it was not possible to accurately and reasonably determine the impact of such errors
relating to such fiscal years. The Company therefore concluded that it was appropriate to adjust the
opening balance of assets and shareholders’ equity as of January 1, 2022, in order to reflect the lower
value of the assets of €46.0 million, by setting up a specific adjustment provision with the opening
shareholders’ equity as of January 1, 2022, as a balancing entry.

As a result of these events, the independent auditors’ report for the consolidated financial statements of
the Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 included in this Offering Memorandum,
contains an emphasis of matter paragraph in relation to the accounting errors due to the inability of the
Issuer to allocate the effects of such errors to periods prior to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
See also Note 1.1 to our 2022 Audited Financial Statements describing the correction of major errors
under IAS 8.

With respect to the accounting treatment of the correction of errors relating to fiscal year 2022, these
were corrected prior to the approval of the 2022 Audited Financial Statements, as required by IAS 8
(par. 5), according to which “potential errors of the current financial year discovered in the same
_financial year shall be corrected before the publication of the financial statements is authorised.”_
Therefore, we corrected the relevant items in the income statement for the year ended December 31,
2022, generating a corresponding impact on the operating profit and EBITDA, which was rectified by
€10.9 million.

These accounting errors were the result of intentional misconduct by certain members of the
management of our Finance industry vertical. As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, such
members of management of the Finance industry vertical are being or have been replaced and these
accounting errors did not result in a material impact on the relationship with our customers.

Following completion of the verification process carried out with respect to the Finance industry
vertical, we deemed it prudent to carry out further verification processes on all the other verticals of the
Company with the assistance of external advisors whose work was completed by the end of 2022. As
of the date of this Offering Memorandum, no incorrect accounting practices similar to those uncovered
in the Company’s Finance industry vertical and Nexen were identified. However, as a result of such
verification process, we prudentially made specific provisions of approximately €7.0 million (of which
€6.1 million relating to contract work in progress and €0.9 million to invoices to be issued) in our
balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, in respect of some positions relating to assets accrued mainly
in previous years and not invoiced, exclusively attributable to technical/commercial issues that emerged
during the execution of the jobs. Such €7.0 million provisions did not impact our consolidated EBITDA
for the year ended December 31, 2022.

As a result of the correction of the accounting errors in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements as
summarized above and the inability of the Issuer to quantify the above-mentioned corrections on net


-----

income and shareholders’ equity for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the consolidated
financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 contained in the 2022 Audited
Financial Statements included in the Offering Memorandum is not fully comparable with (i) the
financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the 2022 Audited
Financial Statements and the 2021 Financial Statements, and (ii) the financial information as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2020 derived from the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements. For the
same reasons, the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 derived from
the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements is also not fully comparable with the financial information
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and
the 2021 Financial Statements. Neither the 2021 Financial Statements nor the Company’s 2020
Financial Statements are included in the Offering Memorandum.

This Offering Memorandum also includes certain financial information as of and for the two months
ended February 28, 2022 under “Summary—Recent Trading,” which is compared to corresponding
financial information as of and for the two months ended February 28, 2023. Such information as of
and for the two months ended February 28, 2022 was impacted by the accounting error described above
due to our inability to allocate the impact of the accounting error on the 2022 Audited Financial
Statements on a quarter or monthly basis through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. As a result,
the financial information as of and for the two months ended February 28, 2022 presented herein is not
fully comparable with the financial information as of and for the two months ended February 28, 2023
(which was not impacted by the accounting error), and therefore you should not place undue reliance
on such information.

As a consequence of the foregoing, throughout this Offering Memorandum, we have either marked any
such consolidated financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021,
including any related averages, ranges and growth rates, with an asterisk (“*”) or we have included
appropriate footnotes to the relevant financial tables as a reminder that each such financial information
may be affected by accounting errors. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing our
results of operations and balance sheet assets among the periods under review in this Offering
Memorandum, and in particular those relating to our Finance industry vertical.

Following the identification of the accounting errors described above, we have implemented what we
believe to be adequate changes to reinforce our internal control systems as well as oversight mechanisms
to prevent the implementation of similar accounting errors. The measures we deployed include: (i) an
intensified monitoring of our invoice cycle, (ii) the enhanced supervision of sales functions at each
industry vertical, (iii) the implementation of a new credit monitoring procedure, and (iv) the
centralization of internal control and risk functions previously performed by each industry vertical
independently. We also created a new “order management” function and strengthened our internal
control team, including by appointing a new credit manager.

See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We identified certain accounting
_errors relating to 2022 and previous fiscal years, which resulted in an overstatement of the Company’s_
_consolidated balance sheet assets and operating profits, and the independent report to the 2022 Audited_
_Financial Statements included in the Offering Memorandum includes an emphasis of matter paragraph_
_in relation to such errors due to our inability to allocate their effects to periods prior to the year ended_
_December 31, 2022. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing our results of_
_operations and balance sheet assets among the periods under review in this Offering Memorandum,_
_and in particular those relating to our Finance industry vertical.”_

**Impact of Acquisitions and Disposals Carried Out by the Group in the Periods under Review**

Our operating results and their comparability for the periods under review are impacted by the effects
of certain acquisitions and disposals made by the Group. Between January 1, 2020 and December 31,
2022, we acquired majority stakes in, or the entire capital stock of, nine companies and business units
(excluding transactions in which we only increased our stake in previously consolidated companies). In


-----

particular, we completed one acquisition in 2020, five acquisitions in 2021 and three acquisitions in
2022 (including the Be Acquisition). In 2020 and 2021, we also completed the spin-offs of our
subsidiaries Sofiter Tech S.r.l. and OverIT S.p.A. (“OverIT”), which have exited the consolidation
perimeter of the Group with effect from December 31, 2020 and December 1, 2021, respectively. The
financial results of acquired entities are consolidated into our results of operations since the date of their
acquisition (September 26, 2022 for the Be Group), while the results of disposed entities are no longer
consolidated into our results of operations since the date of their disposal. As a consequence of each of
such acquisitions and disposals, our results of operations in the periods under review may not be entirely
comparable. Moreover, our operating results going forward will not be comparable with our historical
operating results presented herein. See _“—General,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our_
_Results of Operations—The Engineering Acquisition in 2020” and “Management’s Discussion and_
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of_
_Operations and Financial Condition—Acquisitions and Disposals.”_

**Our Industry Verticals, Activities and Technologies**

We report our results across six industry verticals in accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments) as
follows: (i) Finance, (ii) Health, (iii) Industry & Services, (iv) Telco & Media, (v) Energy & Utilities,
and (vi) Public Administration.

Our Finance industry vertical comprises services to banks, insurance companies and financial
institutions. Through our Health industry vertical, we serve public and private entities operating in the
healthcare sector. Through our Industry & Services industry vertical we serve large and medium-sized
corporations operating in various industries, including the retail, fashion, manufacturing, and process
agriculture industries, as well as public and private operators in the transportation sector. Our Telco &
Media industry vertical comprises services to customers in the telecommunications industry as well as
media services. Our Energy & Utilities industry vertical comprises services to customers in the energy
industry as well as utilities. Lastly, through our Public Administration industry vertical we serve central
and local public administration customers.

We believe that the organization and reporting of the results of our business along these industry
verticals properly reflects the positioning of our business across our key industries and provides
investors with a detailed understanding of the nature of our customers and the industries that drive our
results of operations. Please refer to “Summary—Summary Historical and Certain Other Financial
_Data,” “Business—Our Business—Industry Verticals” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a presentation of our revenues and Adjusted_
EBITDA by industry vertical for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.
Additionally, the period-to-period discussion of our results of operations set forth under “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” includes a discussion of_
our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA split by industry vertical. Following a strategic review of our
business operations and positioning, beginning on January 1, 2022, we also report our results by the
following activity types through which we offer our IT services, software and digital platforms to our
customers: Proprietary Solutions, Digitech and System Integration. This Offering Memorandum
presents and discusses our results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 by retrospectively
grouping our results by activity types even if implemented beginning on January 1, 2022. Previously,
until December 31, 2021, we reported our results by the following activity types: Proprietary Solutions,
Application Transformation and Managed Services. Compared to our former activities split, our
Proprietary Solutions portfolio has remained substantially unchanged (the main difference being the
impact of the spin-off of our subsidiary OverIT in 2021) and encompasses all solutions embedding
software products for which we retain exclusive ownership (regardless of whether such solutions related
to high-technological or traditional products), while our previous allocation of services and products
between Application Transformation and Managed Services has been further refined to reflect our new
strategy in targeting customers by well-defined activity types, in order to achieve competitive
advantages. In particular, through our new Digitech activities we aim to consolidate our entire portfolio


-----

of professional IT solutions for high-technology third-party products into a comprehensive hub. In
addition, our Digitech activities include day-to-day management services and end-to-end operation
services for the infrastructure of our customers (which also comprise hosting and desktop management
solutions). Following the acquisition of Atlantic Technologies in 2022, we offer its services as part of
our Digitech portfolio. Moreover, through our new System Integration activities we aim to focus on
offering solutions for the management and maintenance of more traditional IT systems, thereby
enhancing our support capabilities. Moreover, following the completion of the Be Acquisition, we offer
a large portion of Be’s products and solutions portfolio (mainly comprised of Be’s business consulting,
information technology and digital business services) through a new fourth separate activity type,
Consulting, while the remaining portion of Be’s portfolio has been allocated to, and is offered as part
of, our existing three activity types. We expect that the allocation of Be’s products and solutions
portfolio by activity types will evolve as the integration of Be into our business operations progresses.

Our activities related to Proprietary Solutions cover a wide range of industry-specific, innovative
vertical software as well as professional services directly related to such software. Typically, our
Proprietary Solutions relate to software products for which we retain exclusive ownership and which
we make available to our customers on the basis of individually negotiated licensing agreements. Our
activities relating to Digitech include the development and customization of high-growth digital
enabling solutions using advanced analytics, cloud, cybersecurity, customer experience, IoT, robotic
process automation, AR / MR / VR, digital twin and blockchain technologies in cooperation with our
partners including, among others, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, SAS, IBM and Oracle. In addition,
Digitech includes activities related to strategic partnerships with major software vendors including,
among others, Salesforce and SAP. Our System Integration activities comprise integration services
related to the implementation, management and maintenance of traditional IT solutions. Our Consulting
activities will comprise the business consulting, information technology and digital business services
offered by the Be Group. See “Business—Our Business—Activities.” Please refer to “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting_
_Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Sales Mix across Activities and Industry Verticals” for_
a presentation of our revenues by activity type.

The financial information presented for each of our activity types described above does not represent
accounting segment information under IFRS 8 (Operating Segments) and has been prepared solely for
purposes of this Offering Memorandum, is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily
indicative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.
Despite these limitations, we believe such information is a helpful tool to present and discuss our results
of operations and strategic focus. The financial information relating to our activity types set forth in this
Offering Memorandum has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors, is based on our
management accounts and relies on management judgment.

**Financial Information of the Be Group**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain limited historical consolidated financial information of Be
for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022. This financial information has been extracted
or derived from the financial statements (prepared in accordance with IFRS) and other information of
Be and has not been prepared by us or audited or reviewed by our auditors. The historical consolidated
financial information of Be contained in this Offering Memorandum is being been presented for
illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent, or be indicative of our own historical financial
information as if Be had been fully consolidated by us for each relevant period. We cannot guarantee
that Be’s historical financial information that we present in this Offering Memorandum has been
prepared on a comparable basis to our own financial information and accounting policies. We also
cannot guarantee its accuracy and completeness, and we have not independently verified or reviewed
such information and such information should not be relied upon in making, or refraining from making,
any investment decision. Accordingly, the historical financial information of Be presented in this
Offering Memorandum should be treated with caution. Any use of or reliance on such financial
information without taking into account the limitations referenced above could lead you to make an


-----

incorrect, non-advisable or inadequate investment decision. Any reliance you place on this information
should fully take this into consideration. The financial information of Be for the period from its
consolidation into our results (i.e., September 26, 2022) through December 31, 2022 is reflected in the
2022 Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—
_The financial information of Be included in this Offering Memorandum, on a stand-alone basis and_
_combined with the financial information of the Group, has been derived from Be’s financial statements_
_and has not been prepared by us or audited or reviewed by our auditors; reliance on such information_
_without understanding the limitations described below could lead you to make an incorrect, non-_
_advisable or inadequate investment decision.”_

**Certain Aggregated Data**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain unaudited aggregated financial information and other data
of the Group, for the year ended December 31, 2022, as if the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the
Group of certain other companies completed in 2022 had occurred on January 1, 2022. In particular,
this Offering Memorandum contains breakdowns of the aggregated Group revenues by geography,
industry verticals and activity types for the year ended December 31, 2022. This data has been
calculated as the sum of the relevant corresponding metrics for each of the Group, the Be Group and
such companies acquired in 2022 (in each case, to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results
for the relevant period in such year) without making any eliminations and/or adjustments for the relevant
periods. In addition, for purposes of such calculations, we have assumed that we, the Be Group and the
other acquired companies have identical accounting policies.

Aggregated revenues of the Group by industry vertical for the year ended December 31, 2022, have
been calculated as follows: (i) Finance, by adding the relevant portion of Be’s revenues to the Finance
industry vertical revenues generated by the Group for the same period, (ii) Public Administration, by
adding the relevant portion of Be’s revenues to the Public Administration industry vertical revenues
generated by the Group for the same period, (iii) Industry & Services, by adding the revenues of the
acquired companies PluSure, Atlantic Technologies, and a portion of Be’s revenues to the Industry &
Services industry vertical revenues generated by the Group for the same period, and (iv) Health, Energy
& Utilities and Telco & Media, by reflecting the revenues generated by the Group for each such vertical,
respectively, over the same period.

Aggregated revenues of the Group by activity type for the year ended December 31, 2022, have been
calculated as follows: (i) Proprietary Solutions, by adding the relevant portion of Be’s revenues to the
Proprietary Solutions revenues generated by the Group for the same period; (ii) Digitech, by adding the
revenues of the acquired companies Atlantic Technologies and PluSure, and the relevant portion of Be’s
revenues to the Digitech revenues generated by the Group for the same period; (iii) System Integration,
by adding the relevant portion of Be’s revenues to the System Integration revenues generated by the
Group for the same period; and (iv) Consulting, by allocating the relevant portion of Be’s revenues and
the revenues of our subsidiary Nexen to this newly created activity type.

These unaudited aggregated financial information and other data have not been audited, are not required
by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles, and
have not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities
Act of 1933, as amended. These unaudited aggregated financial information and other data contained
in this Offering Memorandum are being been presented for illustrative purposes only and they are not
intended to represent, or be indicative of our own historical financial information as if Be and the other
acquired companies had been consolidated into our results from January 1, 2022. See “Forward_Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The financial_
_information of Be included in this Offering Memorandum, on a stand-alone basis and combined with_
_the financial information of the Group, has been derived from Be’s financial statements and has not_
_been prepared by us or audited or reviewed by our auditors; reliance on such information without_


-----

_understanding the limitations described below could lead you to make an incorrect, non-advisable or_
_inadequate investment decision” and “—We may not realize any or all of the adjustments to Pro Forma_
_Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA included in the Offering Memorandum.”_

**As Adjusted Financial Information**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited as adjusted financial information for the
Issuer, which is based on our consolidated financial information, on an as adjusted basis to reflect
certain effects of the Offering and the Bridge Facility Refinancing on the indebtedness, cash position
and interest expense of the Group as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022. See “Summary
_Historical and Certain Other Financial Data—Other Financial Information and As Adjusted Data” and_
“Capitalization.” This as adjusted financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only
and does not represent what our actual interest expense would have been had the Offering and the
Bridge Facility Refinancing occurred on January 1, 2022 or what our actual cash position or
indebtedness would have been had the Offering and the Bridge Facility Refinancing occurred on
December 31, 2022, nor does it purport to project our indebtedness, cash position or interest expense at
any future date. The as adjusted financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any
generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the
resulting adjusted financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally
accepted auditing standards.

**Non-IFRS Measures**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS
or any other generally accepted accounting principles. We refer to these measures as “non-IFRS
measures” as they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the
most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, or are calculated
using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with IFRS. In particular, we present
certain financial measures of the Group and ratios related thereto in this Offering Memorandum,
including: organic revenue growth, organic Adjusted EBITDA growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA
Margin, capital expenditure, net working capital, adjusted net working capital, free operating cash flow
and cash conversion and other measures and ratios that are not recognized by, or presented in
accordance with, IFRS (collectively, the “Non-IFRS Measures”). We use such measures to assess the
financial performance and liquidity of our business. We believe that these and similar measures are
used widely by the investment community, securities analysts and other interested parties, as
supplemental measures of performance and liquidity and are intended to assist in the analysis of our
results of operations, profitability and ability to service debt.

Non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies
and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
analysis of the Group’s operating results as reported under IFRS.

An explanation of the relevance of each of the Non-IFRS measures, a reconciliation of the Non-IFRS
measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS
and a discussion of their limitations is set out in this Offering Memorandum. See “Summary Historical
_and Certain Other Financial Data.” We do not regard these non-IFRS measures as a substitute for, or_
superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS or those
calculated using financial measures that are calculated in accordance with IFRS.

Our primary Non-IFRS Measures are defined as follows:

- “Organic revenue growth” and “Organic Adjusted EBITDA growth” are defined as the
percentage growth in Group revenue or Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, between two periods


-----

(the later of such periods, the “subsequent period”), excluding from the subsequent period the
contribution to the Group’s revenues or Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, by entities that were
acquired by the Group during such period;

- “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net profit from continuing operations before income taxes,
income (expenses) from investments, financial income, financial expense (excluding interests
on lease liabilities), interest on lease liabilities, depreciation of right-of-use assets, depreciation
of property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of assets, and
further adjusted for the effects of certain events and transactions that management considers to
be unrelated to our underlying trading performance, including stock option costs, retirement
incentives, audit costs, non-ordinary charges related to the OverIT spin-off, charges for
corporate transactions, non-income tax assessment costs and corporate strategic assessment
expenses. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it is widely used by securities analysts,
investors and other interested parties to evaluate the profitability of companies. Adjusted
EBITDA eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital
structures (affecting net finance costs), tax positions (such as the availability of net operating
losses against which to relieve taxable profits), the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting
relative depreciation expense), the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting
relative amortization expense) and other items not considered by management to relate to the

The Non-IFRS Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS
and should not be considered as alternatives to performance or liquidity measures derived in accordance
with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. An explanation of the relevance of
each of the Non-IFRS Measures, a reconciliation of the Non-IFRS Measures to the most directly
comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and a discussion of their
limitations is set out in this Offering Memorandum under “Summary Historical and Certain Other
_Financial Data.”_

The Non-IFRS Measures are not measures of financial performance recognized under IFRS and they
should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as measures of operating performance,
operating cash flows, the basis for dividend distribution or as measures of liquidity. Consequently, the
methodology used for their calculation may not be consistent with that adopted by other companies and,
therefore, the Non-IFRS Measures we present herein may not be comparable with those of others. Some
of the limitations of Non-IFRS Measures are that:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or
contractual commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service
interest or principal payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

- they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our
consolidated income statement;

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider
not to be indicative of our ongoing operations;

- assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be
replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such
replacements; and


-----

- other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we
do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, the Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will
be available to us to meet our obligations or as measures of performance in order to assist in the analysis
of our operating results and profitability. You should compensate for these limitations by relying
primarily on our 2022 Audited Financial Statements and using these Non-IFRS Measures only as a
supplement to evaluate our performance. Please see “Summary Historical and Certain Other Financial
_Data,” “Selected Historical Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the 2022 Audited Financial Statements (including_
the related notes), included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this Offering
Memorandum are derived from management estimates, are not part of our 2022 Audited Financial
Statements or our accounting records, and have not been audited or otherwise reviewed by outside
auditors, consultants or experts. Our use or computation of these measures may not be comparable to
the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Any or all of these
measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of performance under IFRS.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data presented in
millions or in thousands, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the
data in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such
information. In addition, as a result of such rounding, the totals of certain financial information
presented in tabular form may differ from the information that would have appeared in such totals using
the unrounded financial information.

**Overview**

We are a leading specialist provider of IT services, software and digital solutions in Italy, with a market
share of approximately 13% in Application & Infrastructure Implementation and 8% in Application
Managed Services, ranking first in three of the five industry verticals under Implementation services in
which we operate, in each case calculated in terms revenue (constant currency basis), in 2022, according
to Gartner® research (Gartner Inc., Market Share: IT Services Worldwide 2022, April 2023). We
provide a holistic suite of leading software and digital solutions to more than 2,750 customers, including
companies and public administration entities, and focus on supporting our customers in digital
transformation projects through a portfolio of integrated ICT solutions, products and consultancy
services. We couple new and advanced digital enabling capabilities, including artificial intelligence
(“AI”) and advanced analytics, cloud-based services, cybersecurity, customer experience, IoT, robotic
process automation, AR / MR / VR, blockchain and digital twin platforms, with a strong know-how of
traditional technological solutions and an intimate knowledge of our broad client base’s core processes.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenues of €1,422.6 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of €207.8 million (representing an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 14.6%). In addition,
following settlement of the Mandatory Offer on December 22, 2022 and completion of the SqueezeOut on December 28, 2022, we successfully completed the Be Acquisition, and as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, we wholly own the Be Group. The Be Group is one of the leading Italian
players in the IT consulting sector and provider of business consulting, information technology and
digital business services to major financial and insurance institutions in Europe, including Italy. The Be
Group also showcases distinctive capabilities in specialized areas such as services for corporate
investment banking and capital markets (including process design solutions, back-office systems, and
capital markets accounting and brokerage platforms), as well as the payments sector (including card
based products, value-added services and open banking models, as well as services for payment systems
and schemes). After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other
companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had
occurred on January 1, 2022, we estimate that the aggregated revenues of the Group for the year ended
December 31, 2022 would have been €1,636.8 million. In addition, after adjusting our Adjusted
EBITDA to include the Adjusted EBITDA of the Be Group and the Adjusted EBITDA of certain
companies acquired in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for
the year ended December 31, 2022), the expected run rate impact from certain ongoing cost saving
activities that we started implementing in 2022, and the impact of certain cost savings synergies
expected to be generated from the integration of the Be Group into our business, in each case, as if such
acquisitions were completed, and such initiatives, actions and cost savings synergies were fully
implemented, as of January 1, 2022, we estimate that our Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA for
the year ended December 31, 2022 would have been €256.9 million.

We operate in the attractive and growing Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets which
proved resilient against the COVID-19 pandemic and, according to Anitec-Assinform, grew at a CAGR
of approximately 4.4% between 2019 and 2021. In 2021, these markets were worth approximately €21.8
billion. The Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets benefit from strong ongoing
digitalization across the Italian public and private sectors and increasing spending in transformation
projects from traditional IT to new digital enabling technologies, which further increased underpinned
by the 2021 National Recovery and Resilience Plan (“PNRR”) adopted by the Italian government in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our leading position in the Italian ICT Services and Software &
Solutions markets, which has been further consolidated following the successful completion of the Be
Acquisition, coupled with our deep local and regional market knowledge and long-lasting relationships
with our customers and partners, uniquely positions us to capitalize on the strong growth in demand for
IT transformation services in Italy, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% between 2021 and
2025, according to Anitec-Assinform.

We offer our IT services, software and digital platforms and solutions to our customers by engaging in
four distinct activity types: Proprietary Solutions, Digitech, System Integration and Consulting:


-----

- **Proprietary Solutions: We offer a wide range of cutting-edge customized, end-to-end IT**
services such as industry-specific, innovative vertical software and related services, primarily
to customers in our Finance, Energy & Utilities, Public Administration, Telco & Media and
Health industry verticals. Our Proprietary Solutions relate to four main software suites, and a
longer tail of approximately 20 smaller products, all developed in-house and owned by us. Our
Proprietary Solutions comprise end-to-end service partnerships with certain of our customers
through which we provide tailored digital service packages which also include System
Integration services. We estimate that, in 2021, we were one of the leading providers of
governance, risk and compliance reporting software for financial institutions, CRM solutions
and billing platforms for utilities providers and healthcare ERP solutions for hospitals in Italy
based on revenue. We generated 26.6% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022
from our activities related to Proprietary Solutions. Following the Be Acquisition, we have
integrated a portion of Be Group’s products and solutions into our Proprietary Solutions
portfolio (including, among others, Be Group’s proprietary digital platforms). After giving
effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies
completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had
occurred on January 1, 2022, we estimate for the year ended December 31, 2022 we would
have generated 24% of the aggregated revenues of the Group from activities related to
Proprietary Solutions.

- **Digitech: We develop and customize high-growth, state-of-the-art digital enabling solutions**
for third-party software, and, in particular, using advanced analytics, cloud, cybersecurity,
customer experience, IoT, robotic process automation, AR / MR / VR, digital twin and
blockchain technologies in cooperation with our partners, including, among others, Microsoft,
Google, Amazon, SAS, IBM and Oracle. In addition, we are also a leading service provider and
system integrator in Italy, customizing and developing third-party digital-enabled IT solutions
through strategic partnerships with major software providers such as Salesforce and SAP. We
provide our Digitech activities on the basis of software and other technological products that
are non-proprietary, with the aim of offering highly customized solutions capable of being
integrated with both third-party and client-owned applications. In addition, as part of our
Digitech portfolio we support, maintain and update third party applications and offer projectbased system integration services for customers as well as software providers. Following the
acquisition of Atlantic Technologies, an international ICT consultancy firm with three offices
worldwide and more than 200 specialized and certified professionals, in 2022, we offer its
services as part of our Digitech portfolio. We generated 36.0% of our revenues in the year ended
December 31, 2022, from our activities related to Digitech. Following the successful
completion of the Be Acquisition, we have integrated a portion of Be Group’s solutions into
our Digitech portfolio (including, among others, certain of Be Group’s ICT solutions). After
giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies
completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had
occurred on January 1, 2022, we estimate for the year ended December 31, 2022 we would
have generated 33% of the aggregated revenues of the Group from activities related to Digitech.

- **System Integration: Our System Integration services comprise integration services related to**
the implementation, managing and maintenance of traditional IT solutions, as well as day-today management and operation services of our customer’ end-to-end infrastructure, including
hosting and desktop management. In addition, our System Integration portfolio comprises other
specialized services we offer to our customers, such as complex information systems,
customized system architectures and applications integration services (for new or existing
hardware and software). Our System Integration portfolio is also supported by our strong knowhow legacy. We generated 32.4% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022 from
our activities related to System Integration solutions. Following the successful completion of
the Be Acquisition, we have integrated a portion of Be Group’s solutions into our System
Integration portfolio (including, among others, the activities of Be’s subsidiary Be Digitech
Solutions S.p.A.). After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of


-----

certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s
results) as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022, we estimate for the year ended December
31, 2022, we would have generated 28% of the aggregated revenues of the Group from activities
related to System Integration.

- **Consulting: Our Consulting activities comprise the business consulting, information**
technology and digital business services offered by the Be Group, mainly to major financial
and insurance institutions in Europe, including Italy. We generated 5.0% of our revenues in the
year ended December 31, 2022 from our activities related to Consulting, representing the
portion of Be’s revenues relating to business consulting, information technology and digital
business services for the period from its consolidation into our results (i.e., September 26, 2022)
until December 31, 2022. After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the
Group of certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the
Group’s results) as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022, we estimate for the year ended
December 31, 2022, we would have generated 14% of the aggregated revenues of the Group
from activities related to Consulting.

We operate in Italy as well as in 20 countries worldwide including major European countries (such as
Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), the United States and Latin
American countries, such as Brazil. For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues generated from
customers outside of Italy accounted for 18.3% of our total revenues. Moreover, following the
completion of the Be Acquisition, we strengthened our international operations, as we offer Be Group’s
products and services in three additional new countries (Poland, Romania and Albania), and increased
our presence in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the
acquisition by the Group of certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already
reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022, we estimate that
approximately 21% of aggregated revenues of the Group would have been generated outside of Italy
for the year ended December 31, 2022. In Italy, we are present in all regions and most metropolitan
cities (including Milan, Rome and Turin) and operate across several sectors of the economy, including
public administration, financial services, utilities, telecommunications, transportation, infrastructure
and healthcare. In particular, we operate our activity types with industry-specific process knowledge
across six industry verticals, which correspond to our reporting segments under IFRS 8 (Operating
_Segments) and represent the verticals or strategic markets in which we operate, with industry-specific_
knowledge supported technologies and competences. Our six industry verticals are Finance, Health,
Industry & Services, Telco & Media, Energy & Utilities and Public Administration. In addition, for
internal reporting purposes, in 2022 we implemented a strategic initiative focusing on the consolidation
of our Energy & Utilities, Industry & Services and Telco & Media industry verticals into a new business
unit, “Enterprise,” and, in 2023, of our Health and Public Administration industry verticals into our new
“Public Sector” business unit. We believe that our new “Enterprise” business unit will increase our
ability to effectively respond to our customers’ needs, with the aim to deliver high-performing solutions
and strengthen our role in rapidly evolving markets. In particular, we believe that through “Enterprise”
we will increase the coordination between our industry verticals, while unlocking the ability to develop
high-quality digital systems for the delivery of cross-domain solutions.

The following charts show our revenues by activity type and industry vertical and geography for the
year ended December 31, 2022, giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of
certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results)
as if they had been completed on January 1, 2022:

______________

_(*) Aggregated figures for the year ended December 31, 2022, giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the_

_Group of certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they_
_had been completed on January 1, 2022._

Our customers include more than 2,750 entities, including large private and blue chip companies and
public sector bodies, among which are six of the largest Italian banks (including Intesa Sanpaolo,
UniCredit and Banco BPM), major telecommunications and media companies (including Vodafone and
Telecom Italia (“TIM”)), utilities companies (including Enel and Eni), manufacturing companies
(including Stellantis)), healthcare organizations (including the Veneto Region healthcare system and
many other large hospitals in Italy), local public administrations (including the municipalities of Rome
and Milan, as well as the IT services arm of the Lombardy region and the Emilia Romagna and
Campania regions) and transportation and infrastructure companies (including _Ferrovie dello Stato_
_Italiane). In 2022 we worked on approximately 36,600 individual IT services, software and digital_
solutions contracts, which were distributed amongst our customers. We seek to create long-term,
strategic relationships with our customers, and aim to be viewed as an integral part of their businesses.
We have historically been able to achieve long-lasting, integral customer relationships by creating
significantly customized and highly specialized products and services that we integrate into our endcustomers’ IT systems. Our average relationship tenure with customers is approximately ten years. Our
business benefits from low customer concentration and significant customer diversification across all
of our industry verticals, with no customer accounting for more than 6.0% of our revenues and no
industry vertical accounting for more than 26.4% of our revenues for the year ended December 31,
2022. In the same period, our top ten customers generated 30% of our revenues.

We believe our success and leading position in the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions
markets is largely dependent on our strong focus on R&D, and we invested approximately €25 million
in R&D in the year ended December 31, 2022. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we are
involved in more than 100 research projects, and our R&D Lab department relies on a team of over 500
professionals, which includes researchers and data scientists (both directly part of our R&D Lab
department) and employees in our Development Labs, Competence Centers and Products Labs, who
cooperate closely with our R&D Labs.

We believe that the Be Acquisition enabled us to create a strong industrial combination and to further
consolidate our strong position in the markets served by our Finance industry vertical as well as our
end-to-end capabilities, given Be Group’s large addressable market, underpinned by strong underlying
market trends. Following the completion of the Be Acquisition, we believe we have further increased
potential cross-selling opportunities, by leveraging both our and Be Group’s brand recognition and
strong reputation across our wide platform of customers, while coupling our broad offer of IT services,
software and digital platforms and solutions with top tier consulting services. For example, we have
been deploying an end-to-end platform of solutions aiming to address all of our customers’ IT needs,


-----

by covering the design of their IT architecture as well as the implementation and integration of
proprietary solutions and/or third-party solutions into their systems. Moreover, following completion
of the Be Acquisition, our customer base includes Be Group’s customers, which comprise major
financial and insurance institutions, such as UniCredit, Nexi, MasterCard and Poste Italiane S.p.A.,
along with Italian industrial players, some of which are already customers of the Group. After giving
effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies completed in
2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on January 1,
2022, we estimate that the Be Group would have comprised approximately 16% of the aggregated
revenues of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2022.

**Our Strengths**

**_Leading player in the attractive Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets with strong_**
**_growth driven by digital transformation secular trend_**

The Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets grew at a CAGR of approximately 4.4%
between 2019 and 2021, and were worth approximately €21.8 billion in 2021. In addition, the Italian
ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets are forecast to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% between 2021
and 2025, mainly driven by (i) increasing penetration of the Italian ICT Services and Software &
Solutions markets, which has further accelerated as a result of the growing reliance on remote working
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) digitalization across all private and public clients, and
increasing spending in transformation projects from traditional IT to new digital enabling technologies
and (iii) increasingly mission critical nature of IT services spending.

The Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets have historically been, and remain,
underpenetrated compared to certain equivalent markets in other European countries, according to
management estimates, which we believe provides us with opportunities for significant further growth,
including in connection with the implementation by the Italian government and regulators of policies
that favor digitalization through IT investments, such as the Industry 4.0 plan and the PNRR,
particularly with respect to its “Mission 1”, which allocates a budget of approximately €30 billion to
investments in digitalization, innovation, competitiveness, culture and tourism, and its “Mission 6”,
which allocates a budget of approximately €11 billion to investments in innovation, research and
digitalization of the national healthcare system. These policies are aimed at increasing the penetration
of IT services in Italy and supporting the digital transition in the country, with expected additional
information and communication technology investments, particularly in the areas of connectivity,
digital transition and enhanced digitalization. The following chart shows a breakdown of the PNRR’s
expected investments across its six missions by the end of 2026, along with an overview of certain key
initiatives addressable by the Group included under its “Mission 1” and “Mission 6:”


-----

______________

_Source: Anitec-Assinform for the expected allocation of the PNRR resources by mission, Management analysis for the_

_addressable initiatives under “Mission 1” and “Mission 6” by the Group._

We believe that our strategic positioning and clear focus on innovation and digital transformation
represents a naturally close match to the objectives of PNRR’s “Mission 1” and “Mission 6.” Growth
in the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets is mainly driven by strong ongoing
digitalization across the Italian public and private sectors, with increased IT services spending on and
diversified growth of new digital enabling technologies, such as (i) IoT (which is expected to grow by
approximately 8.8% between 2022 and 2025), (ii) cloud (which is expected to grow by approximately
24.5% between 2022 and 2025), (iii) big data (which is expected to grow by approximately 12.7%
between 2022 and 2025), (iv) cyber security (which is expected to grow by approximately 14.0%
between 2022 and 2025), (v) AI (which is expected to grow by approximately 21.7% between 2022 and
2025 and (vi) blockchain (which is expected to grow by approximately 26.5% between 2022 and 2025),
according to Anitec-Assinform. See “Industry and Market Overview.”

Additionally, growth in IT services spend is also driven by the increasingly mission-critical nature of
IT services in business operations, which we expect to result in IT services spend in Italy becoming
more resilient in the face of future market downturns and less correlated to macroeconomic trends. We
are also seeing an increasing focus on cost efficiency and specialization of IT services, which is leading
companies to rely on external providers rather than developing IT in-house. For example, we have
recently been awarded a multi-vendor tender by CONSIP relating the provision of IT cloud services to
certain Italian public administrations, aimed at driving a migration from on-premises IT services to
cloud. We believe that our size and expertise in complex software, solutions and IT services compared
to some of our smaller competitors and competitors focusing on less complex products and services,
position us well to benefit from such trends, which we expect to be confirmed in the mid- to long term
and that digitalization will increase and accelerate, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In
addition, we believe that our combination with the Be Group enhances our positioning and our ability
to capitalize from increased IT investments by both the Italian government and the private sector.

**_Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets have strong protected local characteristics,_**
**_which advantages local players like us and creates significant barriers to entry for international_**
**_players_**

The Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets are characterized by high barriers to entry,
especially with respect to international competitors, mainly due to cultural and local commercial
complexities, such as language, local regulatory constraints in most markets including banking, energy,
and healthcare, the importance of local relationships and proximity to customers. As a result, we believe
that these barriers favor local players, thus allowing us to capitalize on our leading positioning in the
market for both traditional technologies and digital enabling technologies in Italy, given our deep
knowledge of the domestic market and long-lasting relationships with a wide cross-section of Italian
customers and partners. Italian customers have also shown to prefer software and IT services suppliers
with whom they share a common language, that have extensive operations in Italy and that have an indepth know-how of the applicable Italian legal and regulatory framework, which we believe makes
entering the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets more challenging for international
players.

**_Leading ICT Services and Software & Solutions provider in Italy with strong positions across all_**
**_industry verticals supported by deep technology expertise, strong business process knowledge and_**
**_well-established customer relationships_**

We are a leading ICT Services and Software & Solutions provider in Italy. In 2022, we were the largest
provider of Application & Infrastructure Implementation services in Italy, with a market share of
approximately 13% in terms of revenues compared to the market shares of approximately 11% and 8%
of our two closest competitors, Accenture and Reply, respectively, according to Gartner. Additionally,
in 2022, we were also one of the largest providers of Application Managed Services in Italy, with a
market share of approximately 8% in terms of revenue, compared to the market shares of approximately
24% and approximately 9% of Accenture and Reply, respectively, according to Gartner (see chart
below). We are one of the largest local players in a fragmented market where scale increasingly matters,
and we have a consistent history of market share gain. The addition of the Be Group into our business
has further consolidated this position, particularly in the markets served by our Finance industry
vertical. We believe that the Be Group is a strong player with unique and distinctive capabilities,
extending to both core areas (such as payments and CIB/capital markets), as well as emerging areas of
focus (such as data, analytics, cyber and insurance). The Be Group also provides highly defensible
consulting activities through a combination of proprietary solutions software, digital projects and endto-end vertical projects, which we expect will enable us to expand the breadth of our solutions portfolio
and enrich our Proprietary Solutions and Digitech offerings, while also allowing us to operate through
our new Consulting activities portfolio. We believe that due to a trend among our customers to
consolidate around key partners, large IT service providers such as ourselves are able to absorb a large
portion of IT spend from returning customers.

We hold leading positions across our industry verticals, which are underpinned by our broad offering
of technology solutions, local and regional regulatory knowledge, long-standing relationship with our
customers and partners, reputation for reliable delivery and cost competitiveness. The following table
provides an overview of our market share and positioning for the Application & Infrastructure
Implementation segment across our industry verticals for the year ended December 31, 2021, according
to Gartner:

_____________

_Chart created by the Group based on Gartner research. Source: Gartner Inc. Market Share: IT Services, Worldwide 2022,_
_April 2023._

_(1)_ _Market includes only Implementation. Selected verticals include: Finance-Banking & Investment Services and_
_Insurance; Energy & Utilities -- Power and Utilities; Industry & Services -- Manufacturing & Natural Resources,_
_Retail, and Transportation; PA & Municipalities, Healthcare -- Education, Government and Healthcare and Life_
_Sciences; Telco & Media -- Communications, Media & Services._

**_Verticalized offerings underpinned by leading niche proprietary software solutions, strong_**
**_technology and digital enabling capabilities, and deep understanding of business core processes_**

We believe that our solutions portfolio, by covering the full spectrum of digital enabling technologies,
is well-placed to address the digitalization trends characterizing the markets in which we operate. In the
year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 26.6% of our revenue from our activities related to
Proprietary Solutions, resulting in solid year-on-year revenue visibility as our proprietary solutions
could neither be implemented nor managed by other IT providers. Compared to the year ended
December 31, 2021, our Proprietary Solutions revenues in 2022 recorded a resilient performance. The
vast majority of revenues generated from our activities related to Proprietary Solutions is now strongly
driven by the sale of software and product-related services following the initial sale of the software
license. Our Proprietary Solutions portfolio enables us to benefit from strong competitive positions in
specific niches, particularly within the Finance, Energy & Utilities, Public Administration, Industry &
Services and Health industry verticals. Our proprietary software solutions portfolio includes four
software suite and 20 smaller products, including (i) _Grace, the leading compliance and risk_
management software program developed for financial institutions, servicing most major banks in Italy,
with a market share estimated to be double that of its closest competitor, (ii) AREAS, one of the largest
digital platforms for the digitalization and integration of clinical and administrative healthcare processes
in the hospital ERP markets and the second largest in the Italian healthcare IT market, (iii) Net@Suite,
the leading cloud-based platform for billing and CRM for all types of sales and distribution operators
in the gas and electricity markets, (iv) JEnte, one of the leading software programs for the digitalization
of processes of Italian municipalities and (v) Ellipse, a software program enabling the total digitalization
of healthcare systems by assisting clinicians in real-time diagnostics, decision and treatment activities
of their patients. Our Proprietary Solutions portfolio targets specific niches across all of our industry
verticals that are highly attractive in light of their regulated nature, the need for highly tailored solutions
and the elevated costs that customers must bear for switching providers. Furthermore, we believe that
the strong reputation of our Proprietary Solutions also allows us to up-sell and cross-sell our System
Integration and Digitech services, although we do not primarily carry out these activities in relation to
proprietary technology. In addition, our Proprietary Solutions also feature digital products including (i)


-----

_Knowage, an open source suite for modern business analytics initiatives from data visualization to deep_
analysis, (ii) _Digital Enabler, a digital platform providing a single point of data knowledge used to_
develop new value added services as well as digitally enabling older technologies and applications and
(iii) Cloudesire, our brokering and monetization platform that enables the immediate distribution of
cloud and digital services, aimed at covering a full end-to-end sell and operate capability model.
Following the completion of the Be Acquisition, our Proprietary Solutions offering has been enriched
by the Be Group’s proprietary solutions for the insurance market (including, among others, its Universo
solution for the life insurance market).

As a result of a strategic review of our business operations and positioning, we now supplement our
strong Proprietary Solutions software offering with our Digitech activities, which are aimed at providing
a cutting-edge portfolio of services for the professional customization of third-party product solutions
and, represented 36.0% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. As part of Digitech, we
offer new and advanced high-growth digital enabling capabilities designed for efficiently interacting
with the relevant third-party software, including advanced analytics, cloud-based services,
cybersecurity, customer experience, IoT, robotic process automation, AR / MR / VR and digital twin
and blockchain platforms. In addition, revenues for both our Proprietary Solutions and Digitech
portfolios are supported by our digital enabling capabilities. Moreover, through our digital services
offering, we have worked on projects including “city-as-a platform” solutions in Italy, with the aim of
increasing the degree of digitalization of the services being offered by private companies and public
entities on integrated technological platforms. We believe that our digital enabling capabilities for both
Proprietary Solutions and Digitech projects have been strengthened as a result of the integration of Be
Group’s digital division into our business, as the Be Group features an engagement hub dedicated to
the development of cutting-edge web, mobile and social media applications for customers, with a focus
on the creation and distribution of digital content and vertical digital solutions.

**_Strong focus on R&D and a highly qualified, digitally-skilled workforce_**

Innovation has always been a key element for our competitiveness and long-term sustainability. We
continuously invest in R&D and innovation to support the ongoing improvement of our organization in
increasing our competitive capacity and fulfilling the needs of a fluid, rapidly changing market. Our
investment in R&D to develop and maintain our research and project management activities has
amounted to approximately €25 million, in the year ended December 31, 2022 and, as of the date of
this Offering Memorandum, we are involved in more than 100 research projects, and our R&D Lab
department relies on a team of over 500 professionals, which includes researchers and data scientists
(both directly part of our R&D Lab department) and employees in our Development Labs, Competence
_Centers and Products Labs, who cooperate closely with our R&D Labs. We also partner with more than_
150 universities globally and have strategic alliances with several research centers globally.

We believe we are among the most active ICT research companies in Europe, attracting funds from
national and EU research programs, being ranked among the top 10 European private for profit
companies (and the first in Italy) in terms of EU funding under the European Union’s Horizon 2020
Programme for Research and Innovation. While, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, no
official documentation has been made available yet by the European Commission, we have been
awarded research funding under the new Horizon Europe 2021-2027 Programme for over 30 initiatives
and are finalizing the grant signature process for further ten initiatives. This confirms our ability to
submit high-quality research projects, and to maintain a strong position within the European research
landscape. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we received €23 million in research funding from
Italian and European research programs.

We also deploy a significant amount of resources for the training of our technology engineers, core
process specialists and digital scientists who support our entire production cycle. Our internal “Enrico
Della Valle” IT & Management Academy, which is considered one of the leading Italian corporate
schools for IT, provides over 500 different course editions, resulting in approximately 32,000 training
days in the year ended December 31, 2022. Our academy issued approximately 1,500 certifications and


-----

trained approximately 6,000 of our employees in the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that
our strong focus on R&D as well as the resources deployed to train our technology engineers, core
process specialists and digital scientists, coupled with our strategic acquisitions, will allow us to
continue to attract and retain skilled employees, despite the constantly increasing talent shortage in the
IT industry, which represents the key challenge in the IT sector.

**_Large and diversified customer base with highly recurring revenues and high levels of customer_**
**_satisfaction_**

We are present in all regions and most metropolitan cities in Italy (including Milan, Rome and Turin)
and operate across several sectors of the economy, including public administration, financial services,
utilities, telecommunications, transportation, infrastructure and healthcare. We have a customer base of
more than 2,750 customers, including large private and blue chip companies and public sector bodies,
among which are six of the largest Italian banks (including Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit and Banco
BPM), major telecommunications and media companies (including Vodafone, TIM and BT), utilities
companies (including Enel and Eni), manufacturing companies (including Stellantis), healthcare
organizations (including the Veneto region healthcare system and other large hospitals in Italy), local
public administrations (including the municipalities of Rome and Milan, as well as the IT services arm
of the Lombardy region, and the Emilia Romagna and Campania regions) and transportation and
infrastructure companies (including Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane). Following the completion of the Be
Acquisition, we believe we have further increased potential cross-selling opportunities, by leveraging
both our and Be Group’s brand recognition and strong reputation across our wide platform of customers,
while coupling our broad offer of IT services, software and digital platforms and solutions with top tier
consulting and digital services. For example, we have been deploying an end-to-end platform of
solutions aiming to address all of our customers’ IT needs, by covering the design of their IT
architecture as well as the implementation and integration of proprietary solutions and/or third-party
solutions into their systems. In addition, we benefit from a high level of exposure to medium and large
enterprise customers compared to other businesses operating within the Italian ICT sector. For the year
ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that approximately 95% of our top 50 customers are large
enterprises or public sector entities and generated 48% of our revenues, in each case after giving effect
to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies completed in 2022
(to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022.
Our business benefits from low customer concentration and significant customer diversification across
all of our industry verticals, with no customer accounting for more than 6.0% of our revenues and no
industry vertical accounting for more than 26.4% of our revenues for the year ended December 31,
2022, in each case after giving effect to the Be Acquisition as if it had been completed on January 1,
2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our top three customers generated approximately 16% of
our revenues, our top five customers generated approximately 22% of our revenues, and our top ten
customers generated approximately 30% of our revenues, in each case after giving effect to the Be
Acquisition as if it had been completed on January 1, 2022.

The following chart provides an overview of our customer concentration and a breakdown of our
customer base by size for the year ended December 31, 2022:

**Customer Concentration and Customer Base by Size**

______________

_(1) Aggregated figures for the year ended December 31, 2022, giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the_

_Group of certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they_
_had been completed on January 1, 2022._

_companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on_
_January 1, 2022._

Our customers value our reliability and excellent track record of delivery, local presence and local and
regional regulatory knowledge, cost effective solutions and highly-personalized, best-in-class offering
of proprietary software solutions and digital capabilities, which we believe has contributed to our
consistently high customer retention rates. In particular, our top ten customers by revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2022, have been with us for more than ten years. We are consistently recognized
as one of the best partners in terms of product personalization and contractual terms in Italy and 96%
of our customers were “very satisfied,” “satisfied” or “neutral” about our product offering and services
in 2022, according to a customer satisfaction survey that we perform every year on approximately 170
customers across all of our industry verticals. The following chart provides an overview of our customer
surveys for the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022:

_____________

_(1) “Satisfied” category includes “Very satisfactory”, “Satisfactory” and “Neutral”._
_(2) “Unsatisfied” category includes “Very unsatisfactory” and “Unsatisfactory”._

In addition, a large share of our revenues across each of our activity lines is highly recurring. In
particular, the revenues we generate from our activities related to Proprietary Solutions, accounted for
26.6% of total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022, are highly recurring and demonstrate our


-----

long-lasting relationships with our Proprietary Solutions customers primarily as a result of the local,
highly specialized and customized nature of our Proprietary Solutions as well as their integration into
our end-customers’ IT systems, which also limits competition for our products and services in respect
of those customers. In addition, we consider the revenues we generate from our activities related to
System Integration and relating to the day-to-day management and operation services of our customers’
end-to-end infrastructure to also be recurring, as they are secured by long-term contracts. While
contractual frameworks for managed services provided as part of System Integration are usually three
to five years in length, we generally have long-term relationships with our System Integration customers
and record high levels of contract renewals. In addition, these customers display high retention rates
also due to the difficulty of switching to a different provider. Lastly, a significant portion of revenues
we generate from our activities related to Digitech is backed by high levels of contract renewals and
therefore we consider them to be recurring, also in light of our successful track record of service delivery
and our knowledge of complex IT systems.

The high share of recurring contracts with our existing customers across all of our industry verticals has
allowed us to maintain a stable revenue performance. Moreover, our ability to sell additional valueadded services to existing customers allowed us to increase spending of our existing customers over
time, thus increasing our revenue generation. After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the
acquisition by the Group of Atlantic Technologies as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022, between
January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022, revenues generated from our top five and top ten customers
increased at CAGRs of approximately 18.4*% and 11.7*%, respectively.

**_Strong financial profile with consistent, resilient growth and cash flow generation, with further_**
**_potential to improve margin performance through cost saving initiatives_**

Over the past 20 years, our revenue expansion has been driven by mid- to high single digit organic
growth supported by continuous investments in R&D and training as well as growth from selective
value accretive acquisitions of attractive IT services assets, including, among others, our acquisitions
of Atos Origin Italia in 2008, T-Systems Italia, in 2013, Infogroup in 2017 and the Movilitas group,
Design Automation Associates, C Consulting in 2021, and PluSure S.p.A. and Atlantic Technologies
in 2022. Additionally, our revenues have remained resilient through volatile macroeconomic cycles
during the past 20 years, including through the COVID-19 pandemic, with our revenues’ organic growth
outperforming Italian GDP growth on a year-over-year basis since 2003. For the year ended December
31, 2022, we generated revenues of €1,422.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €207.8 million. In
addition, for the year ended ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a 10.0%* organic growth of our
revenues and, for the same period, a 19.2%* organic growth of our Adjusted EBITDA, in each case
excluding the results of our Finance industry vertical from 2021 to 2022.

_as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 extracted from the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and presented_

_accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors,” and_
_therefore you should not place undue reliance on such information. See also Note 1.1 to our 2022 Audited Financial_
_Statements describing the correction of major errors under IAS 8, and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business_
_and Industry—We identified certain accounting errors that occurred prior to 2022, which resulted in an overstatement_

_Group of certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if_
_they had been completed on January 1, 2022._

Our business has historically benefitted from high cash conversion (defined as the ratio of Adjusted
EBITDA _less capital expenditure to Adjusted EBITDA, expressed as percentage), which averaged_


-----

approximately 84.5%* annually between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022, as a result of our
robust margin profile and limited capital expenditures from our asset-light model.

Historically, we have also been able to increase our margins as a result of continued operational
improvements and operating leverage, and we believe there is further potential to improve our margins
through operational initiatives. In particular, we have deployed several cost savings initiatives,
including (i) an initiative to streamline and optimize our workforce by facilitating turnover and filling
vacant positions with young, highly-skilled personnel coupled with an increased nearshoring presence,
(ii) the renegotiation of services and utilities contracts relating to our facilities and offices to improve
the terms thereof and (iii) other cost-saving efficiencies resulting from our company-wide transition to
smart working. Several of these measures have now been implemented in our business structure
(including, among others, few initiatives related to our procurement processes).

In addition, in 2022, as part of our ambition to implement a solid cost optimization plan, we started
implementing a comprehensive range of further cost savings and efficiency initiatives aimed at
enhancing our operations and improving our ability to respond to changes in the demand for our
products and solutions, by further increasing the flexibility of our cost structure. In the aggregate, we
expect these cost savings and efficiency initiatives to generate €16.2 million of annual run rate cost
savings by the end of 2023 (€9.8 million of which have been already achieved for the year ended
December 31, 2022), with further room for potential upside. Once achieved, we expect that these cost
savings will structurally reduce the Group’s cost base going forward. Our key cost savings and
efficiency initiatives include: (A) procurement initiatives, consisting of: (i) the streamlining of our
contractual relationships with external IT consultants through the introduction of competitive tender
procedures and a structured supplier qualification process, and (ii) the reduction of costs related to the
procurement of software products, primarily by consolidating our current software providers base into
a limited number of distributors and resellers, and consolidating our IT spend with certain selected
original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”); (B) optimization initiatives targeting the reduction of
utilities, maintenance and rent costs related to our real estate portfolio, including the reduction of our
square footage at multiple locations and office closures in up to three out of 13 non-strategic locations
in Italy as well as the opening of a new flagship office in Milan (Italy); and (C) a broad range of other
cost saving initiatives including the outsourcing of payroll activities, the implementation of headcount
optimization and reduction projects including nearshoring in Serbia and adjacent countries,
rationalization projects aimed at consolidating our legal structure, and vendor rebate management
activities.

**_Attractive consolidation platform with track record of creating value through integration of bolt-on_**
**_acquisitions_**

We believe we are a natural consolidator in the fragmented Italian ICT Services and Software &
Solutions markets and have a strong track-record of successfully integrating acquired entities, allowing
us to expand our product offering and geographic reach, generate significant cross-selling opportunities
into our existing customer base and realize synergies, while fostering future growth. Between January
2020 and December 31, 2022, we completed 9 acquisitions (including the Be Acquisition). Our M&A
strategy also relies on our ability to leverage an enhanced level of competences and stronger R&D
capabilities following the integration of acquired businesses, with the aim of reinforcing our digital
capabilities.

We constantly evaluate opportunities for prudent, highly targeted and strategic bolt-on acquisitions,
with fair acquisition prices typically funded through organic cash flow generation. Over the past five
years, we completed more than 20 bolt-on acquisitions. Past bolt-on acquisitions include (i) Cybertech
Group in 2019, which allowed us to expand our cybersecurity offering and consolidate our leadership
position in the rapidly expanding cybersecurity segment, (ii) Deus Technology in 2019, which allowed
us to expand our finance expertise with wealth management fintech solutions, (iii) Digitelematica in
2019, which allowed us to increase our e-commerce offerings to retail customers, (iv) FDL Servizi in
2020, which allowed us to expand our software solutions for smart-grid management services, (v) C


-----

Consulting in 2021, which allowed us to strengthen our portfolio of proprietary solutions for the
reinsurance market, (vi) Movilitas group in 2021, which consolidated our position in the United States
by expanding our offering of smart solutions for the manufacturing industry, (v) PluSure S.p.A. in 2022,
which allowed us to expand our product design solutions portfolio for our industry 4.0 customers, and
strengthened the positioning of our eXcellence global division on the European markets, and (vi)
Atlantic Technologies S.p.A. in 2022, which allowed us to expand our presence in the cloud technology
area of CRM, ERP and analytics. In particular, these acquisitions enabled us to significantly strengthen
our digital product and service offering in the United States, which resulted in a €56.3 million increase
in revenues generated in the United States, from €15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020,
to €71.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In addition, following completion of the Be Acquisition, we wholly own the Be Group, one of the
leading Italian players in the IT consulting sector and provider of business consulting, information
technology and digital business services to major financial and insurance institutions in Europe,
including Italy. As a result of the Be Acquisition, we expanded our international operations into three
new countries (Albania, Poland and Romania), while also strengthening our presence in the DACH
region (i.e., Germany, Austria and Switzerland). The successful completion of the Be Acquisition
further consolidated our leadership position in the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions
markets, in particular by enabling us to further broaden our best-in-class portfolio of consulting and
digital transformation services to customers in the markets served by our Finance industry vertical.

Through our M&A-focused team, we have developed a disciplined and clear approach to M&A activity,
targeting best-in-class specialized IT services providers with a focus on increasing our higher margin
Proprietary Solutions and Digitech portfolios, complementing our service offering and digital
capabilities by strengthening our industry-vertical specific product portfolio and thus consolidating our
leading positions across our industry verticals in order to strategically support our organic growth.

**_Strong leadership team with proven track record of delivery supported by committed Sponsors_**

Our business is supported by the experience of our senior management team, which benefits from the
experience and knowledge of our Sponsors. Following the Engineering Acquisition, highly experienced
and reputable professionals who are widely recognized for their international track record of operational
excellence and capacity to deliver have joined our senior management team. In 2021, we welcomed our
Chairman, Gaetano Miccichè, who contributes his wide knowledge of the Italian financial landscape,
our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Maximo Ibarra, who brings a wealth of significant experience in
running high profile businesses, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Massimo Cunico, who has a strong
background in the manufacturing business in Italy and internationally. Under their leadership, we have
continued to consolidate our position as one of the leading independent Italian specialist provider of IT
services, software and digital platforms through both organic growth and successful add-on acquisitions
(including the recent acquisition of the Movilitas group in 2021 and the acquisition of Atlantic
Technologies S.p.A. in 2022). Our key management team also includes our industry vertical leaders
and other corporate executives such as our Executive Vice President Digitech Fabio Momola, our Vice
President for the “Enterprise” business unit Guido Porro, our Chief HR Officer Alessia D’Addario, our
Chief Procurement and Strategic Officer Fabio Francalancia, our General Counsel Sabrina delle Curti,
and our Head of M&A Francesco G. Schininà. Our senior management team is supported by a highly
capable, committed and specialized second level management, with a proven track records of
developing and marketing innovative products and solutions, and by our project management office,
which stages 566 certified project management professionals, who ensure solid and innovative
management of our customers’ and our own projects, while enabling us to provide skilled project
management and project management office specialists across all of the markets that we service. We
also benefit from an average of 12,474 highly productive, well-trained employees as at December 31,
2022 (including the Be Group). Our constant priority is to maintain our competitiveness by
strengthening our skillset and the quality of our talent pool. To this end, in 2022 we accelerated the
intake of talent into the Group. Following completion of the Be Acquisition, the Be Group’s day-to-day
operations continue to be managed by Mr. Stefano Achermann (Be’s founder and current Chief


-----

Executive Officer), in order to ensure continuity. Since November 2022, Mr. Achermann also leads our
Finance industry vertical, and is supported by a team that was further strengthened through the addition
of certain managers of the Be Group. We believe that our highly experienced management team will
continue to focus on delivering growth and development of our operations, while ensuring the efficient
integration of the Be Group into our business.

**Our Strategies**

**_Continue to grow and build on our leading market position_**

We are a leading ICT services and Software and Solutions provider in Italy, with a market share of
approximately 13% in Implementation and 8% in Application Managed Services in terms of revenue in
2022, according to Gartner. Our revenues grew at a CAGR of 8.0%* (and at a CAGR of 9.5%, excluding
the results of our Finance industry vertical) between 2020 and December 31, 2022, despite the COVID19 outbreak, thereby contributing towards consolidating our market share in Italy. Excluding the results
of our Finance industry vertical, our organic revenue growth would have would have been 10.0%* in
2022. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to continue to grow our market share by capturing
the future growth of the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets, benefitting from
increasing penetration, digitalization across all private and public sectors, and increasing spending on
new digital enabling technologies. We believe the successful completion of the Be Acquisition has
enabled us to consolidate our leadership market position in the Finance industry vertical and to grow
our market share in the Italian market and abroad. In particular, following the successful completion of
the Be Acquisition, we are operating from offices in various new countries, including in Central and
Eastern Europe, such as Albania, Poland and Romania, while also strengthening our presence in the
DACH region (i.e., Germany, Austria and Switzerland). We intend to continue to leverage our strong
technological capabilities and broad range of digital solutions which we have successfully implemented
across our activity types, industry verticals and customers to further capture opportunities to cross-sell
and up-sell our products and services. In particular, we believe that the continuing demand for our
digital enabling technologies will present us with an opportunity to further grow our market share in
Italy. Additionally, we plan to continue to center our business around the needs of our loyal customer
base, which we believe will allow us to maintain our track record of growing our digital offerings among
our top customers.

**_Strengthen our advanced technological platform, unrivalled digital capabilities and industry_**
**_partnerships complemented by the Be Group’s proprietary platforms_**

We have a strong track record of product innovation and strive to continuously develop new and tailored
digital offerings to meet our customers’ latest digital needs. Our R&D Lab, which is the core driver of
our products and services innovation process works closely with other units of the company, including
our _Innovators Network, consisting of several innovation experts who analyze market trends and_
weaknesses and translate them into ideas for innovative solutions and products, our Development Labs,
comprising a dedicated group of professionals who develop state-of-the art marketable digital
technologies, and our Products Labs, comprising a dedicated group of professionals who are devoted
to designing, developing and maintaining our proprietary solutions. Leveraging our R&D capabilities,
we intend to further strengthen our technological platform by continuing to invest in key areas, spanning
across all of our industry verticals: cybersecurity, digital industry, smart transportation, smart city, smart
government, smart energy, digital media, cloud, big data, blockchain and AI. For example, in September
2022 we started a strategic collaboration with Leonardo S.p.A., a global leader in the aerospace, defence
& security sector, to identify projects and business opportunities to be developed jointly in the field of
Digital Transformation and Cybersecurity with a particular focus on the defense, healthcare, finance,
public administration and infrastructure sectors, including through joint R&D initiatives. In addition,
following the successful completion of the Be Acquisition, we have enriched our portfolio of proprietary
solutions, strengthening in particular our positioning as a key provider of services to the broader finance
industry.


-----

We also intend to further capitalize on our strong, long-standing relationships with key strategic
partners, who comprise next-generation technology vendors and service providers and include
worldwide leaders in public cloud and SaaS services, such as Amazon Web Services, Google and
Microsoft, ERP and CRM solutions, such as SAP, Oracle, Salesforce and Microsoft, as well as a large
pool of digital technologies providers, such as Adobe, Cisco, RedHat and VMware. We believe that our
focus on strong relationships with key industry partners will continue to allow us to provide our
customers with access to cutting-edge digital platforms and solutions. To that end, in April 2023, we
entered into a binding commitment for a partnership in respect of the digital platform of Illimity Bank
S.p.A. (“Illimity”), an established banking digital platform, including exclusive distribution rights
relating to such platform for our Finance industry vertical until 2032. This partnership is currently
expected to generate contractual revenues of €15 million per year until 2032 for the professional
services that we are expected to provide in connection with the distribution of Illimity’s platform to
third parties, while also unlocking potential upsides driven by our exclusive distribution rights, all of
which remains subject to the finalization of the long-form partnership terms, which is expected by the
end of June 2023. The total consideration for the partnership is €55.5 million (which may be increased
by €4.5 million between 2024 and 2032), which will be paid in the period from 2023 to 2026, with
approximately €10.0 million paid in 2023 and funded by cash on hand.

**_Increase our offering of Proprietary Solutions and Digitech_**

We believe that our large portfolio of leading, niche vertical proprietary solutions and services supports
our strong reputation as a leading ICT services and Software and Solutions provider in Italy and acts as
a catalyst for our broad service offerings across our industry verticals. Our portfolio of Proprietary
Solutions, which primarily targets customers in our Finance, Energy & Utilities, Public Administration,
Industry & Services and Health industry verticals, has also historically contributed to our strong margins
and highly sticky, recurring revenue from long-term, strategic customer relationships.

In addition to our Proprietary Solutions portfolio, we believe that our reputation and market positioning
are complemented by our portfolio of highly customized Digitech solutions, which we believe allows
us to cover the full spectrum of digital enabling technologies and continue to deliver cutting-edge highsolutions to our customers, capable of being integrated with both third-party and client-owned
applications.

We also intend to continue leveraging our in-house R&D capabilities and developing digital enabling
proprietary solutions to the activities we conduct in relation to Proprietary Solutions. Among others,
our existing portfolio includes Eng-DE4Bios, a system empowered by digital enabling technologies to
integrate and harmonize data available to local government and healthcare systems in Veneto, allowing
for the identification of incidences of COVID-19 infections across a defined territory. We are also
developing selected proof-of-concept (“POC”) projects to be deployed in the metaverse space, focusing
on the following areas: government, healthcare, retail, tourism and education. In addition, at the end of
2022, we signed a strategic partnership agreement with Novartis Italia, leader in the medical-scientific
research, for the development of initiatives and solutions aimed at responding to the challenges of
“Mission 6” of the PNRR by accelerating the digital transition of the Italian healthcare system through
the introduction of cutting-edge technologies in care services, patient care and healthcare facility
management. Moreover, in early 2023, we won, as part of temporary business grouping, a 10-year
concession by AGENAS for the design, implementation, and management of the National Telemedicine
Platform (“PNT”) as the lead contractor. The platform will be entirely cloud-based and will ensure
interoperability and integration. In particular, the PNT aims to connect the central administration with
local administrations, favoring the centralized governance and monitoring of telemedicine processes
implemented at the regional level, in line with “Mission 6” of the PNRR.

**_Increase profitability and cash generation, including through the implementation of cost savings and_**
**_efficiency initiatives_**

We intend to continue leveraging our diversified operating platform and realizing economies of scale
to improve our margins. We intend to increase the share of proprietary software and related services,
which typically generate comparably higher margins due to the significant customization of our
products and services and often result in long-term customer relationships and recurring business.

Our business has historically benefitted from high cash conversion, which averaged approximately
84.4%* annually between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022, as a result of our robust margin
profile from underlying operating leverage and limited capital expenditures from our asset-light model,
as well as stable revenue and consistent Adjusted EBITDA (which grew at a CAGR of 8.0%* and
8.3%* between the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2022, and at a
CAGR of 9.5%* and 15.1%* over the same period, in each case excluding the results of our Finance
industry vertical). Our organic revenue growth was 6.7%* in the year ended December 31, 2021 and
4.0%* in the year ended December 31, 2022 (from €1,298.0* million in 2021 to €1,349.5 million in
2022). Excluding our Finance industry vertical from 2021 to 2022, our organic revenue growth would
have been 10.0%* (from €1,018.9* million in 2021 to €1,120.3 million in 2022). While our organic
Adjusted EBITDA growth was a negative 0.4% in 2022 (from €198.3* million in 2021 to €197.5 million
in 2022), excluding our Finance industry vertical from 2021 to 2022, our organic Adjusted EBITDA
growth would have been 19.2%* (from €125.1* million in 2021 to €149.2 million in 2022). To increase
our cash generation, we intend to continue implementing a disciplined approach to working capital
management and capital expenditure, which averaged approximately 2%* of revenues annually
between 2020 and 2022.

To further increase our profitability and leverage the potential to further improve our margins, we also
plan to continue focusing on implementing cost-savings measures and improve operational efficiency
across the Group. To this end, in 2022 we started implementing a comprehensive range of cost savings
and efficiency initiatives aimed at enhancing our operations and improving our ability to respond to
changes in the demand for our products and solutions, by further increasing the flexibility of our cost
structure. In the aggregate, we expect our cost savings and efficiency initiatives to generate €16.2
million of run rate cost savings by the end of 2023 (€9.8 million of which have been already achieved
for the year ended December 31, 2022). Our key cost savings and efficiency initiatives include: (A)
procurement initiatives, consisting of: (i) the streamlining of our contractual relationships with external
IT consultants through the introduction of competitive tender procedures and a structured supplier
qualification process, and (ii) the reduction of costs related to the procurement of software products,
primarily by consolidating our current software providers base into a limited number of distributors and
resellers, and consolidating our IT spend with certain selected OEMs; (B) optimization initiatives
targeting the reduction of utilities, maintenance and rent costs related to our real estate portfolio,
including the reduction of our square footage at multiple locations and office closures in up to three out
of 13 non-strategic locations in Italy as well as the opening of a new flagship office in Milan (Italy);
and (C) a broad range of other cost saving initiatives including the outsourcing of payroll activities, the
implementation of headcount optimization and reduction projects including nearshoring in Serbia and
adjacent countries, rationalization projects aimed at consolidating our legal structure, and vendor rebate
management activities.

In addition, we believe that our combination with the Be Group will deliver significant value generation,
creating an established player with strong end-to-end capabilities in the financial services sector. By the
end of 2024, we expect to generate approximately €9.5 million of further cost savings in connection
with the integration of the Be Group into our business, which we expect will structurally reduce our
cost base going forward. In connection with the achievement of these synergies, on the basis of
management estimates, we expect that we will incur one-off costs of approximately €5.0 million in
2023 and €10.0 million in 2024. We expect to realize these cost savings through initiatives related to
(i) the optimization of our subcontractor and procurement relationships, the optimization of external
workforce utilization rates and the deployment of near-shoring initiatives, (ii) the optimization and


-----

consolidation of the Group’s and Be’s combined real estate footprint and costs, (iii) the consolidation
of the Group’s and Be’s staff and administrative functions, and (iv) the reduction of compliance
expenses following the Delisting of the Be Group upon completion of the Be Acquisition.

**_Continue to pursue targeted and opportunistic acquisitions to expand capabilities and grow the_**
**_business_**

The Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets remain highly fragmented, and we intend
to further strengthen our leading position and broaden our product portfolio by continuing to consolidate
smaller players. We have developed a disciplined and systematic approach to M&A activity, targeting
best-in-class specialized IT services providers with a focus on increasing our Proprietary Solutions
portfolio, consolidating our leading positions across our industry verticals and strategically
complementing our organic growth. We execute our M&A strategy through our dedicated and
experienced in-house M&A team, who have completed 9 M&A deals between January 1, 2020 and
December 31, 2022, including the Be Acquisition. We believe that this continued focus on acquiring
and integrating best-in-class providers of IT services will allow us to further cross-sell acquired
solutions into our existing customer base and strengthen our R&D capabilities.

We will continue to evaluate opportunities for highly targeted, strategic bolt-on acquisitions, in Italy
and abroad, with a view to expanding our existing product offerings, strengthening our industry-vertical
specific product offerings and increasing our share of revenues from IP and digital capabilities. Key
recent, targeted acquisitions that have allowed us to grow our portfolio and address customers’ needs
include FDL Servizi in 2020, which allowed us to expand our software solutions for smart-grid
management services, C Consulting in 2021, which allowed us to strengthen our portfolio of proprietary
solutions for the reinsurance market, Movilitas group in 2021, which consolidated our position in the
United States by expanding our offering of smart solutions for the manufacturing industry, PluSure
S.p.A. in 2022, which allowed us to expand our product design solutions portfolio for our industry 4.0
customers, and Atlantic Technologies S.p.A. in 2022, which allowed us to expand our presence in the
cloud technology area of CRM, ERP and analytics and increase our exposure to high digital growth
platforms, while strengthening our consulting capabilities. Specifically as a result of recent bolt-on
acquisitions in the United States, we significantly strengthened our local footprint and solutions
portfolio breadth, which resulted in a €56.3* million increase in revenues generated in the United States,
from €15.2* million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €71.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022.

In addition, following completion of the Be Acquisition, we wholly own the Be Group, one of the
leading Italian players in the IT consulting sector and provider of business consulting, information
technology and digital business services to major financial and insurance institutions in Europe,
including Italy. We believe that the successful completion of the Be Acquisition has further consolidated
our leadership position in the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets, in particular by
enabling us to further broaden our best-in-class portfolio of consulting and digital transformation
services to customers in the markets served by our Finance industry vertical. We expect that the ongoing
combination of our business with the Be Group will provide potential upside opportunities for revenue
and profitability growth, including by unlocking revenue synergies and by enabling us to serve as a
one-stop-shop for top-tier ITC and consulting services. In particular, we expect opportunities for
revenue synergies to arise from the cross-selling of both our and Be Group’s products, the integration
of our and Be Group’s end-to-end systems and the increase of our share of captured customer spending,
through a joint new approaching strategy aimed at tier 2 banks and insurance companies.

We continue to see interesting acquisition opportunities across verticals and consider as highly
complementary to our business strategy targets that can contribute to the even development of our
verticals, in particular industrials, finance, utilities and healthcare, as well as add to our delivery
capabilities outside of Italy.

**The Transactions**

**_The Be Acquisition Agreement and the First Be Acquisition Closing Date_**

On June 19, 2022, the Company entered into the Be Acquisition Agreement with the Sellers relating to
the indirect acquisition of 58,287,622 ordinary shares of Be, representing approximately 43.209% (or
45.630% fully diluted) of its share capital (the “Initial Be Shares”), at a unit price of €3.45 per share
(the “Purchase Price”). In addition, on June 30, 2022, the Company formally accepted the unilateral
conditional undertakings submitted on May 3, 2022 by certain shareholders of Be, other than the Sellers
(the “Additional Sellers”), to sell additional ordinary shares of Be, representing approximately 7.998%
(or 8.446% fully diluted) of its share capital (the “Additional Be Shares”), to the Company, for a price
equal to the Purchase Price, on the First Be Acquisition Closing Date. Although the Be Acquisition
Agreement includes certain customary representations, warranties and indemnities given by the Sellers
as to, _inter alia, capacity, title and disclosure, as well as certain other business representations,_
warranties and indemnities by one key Seller, the Issuer may not be able to enforce claims against the
Sellers relating to breaches of these representations, warranties and indemnities. In addition, the Sellers’
liability for any breach of the abovementioned warranties is subject to certain thresholds and limitations.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Be Acquisition—We may not be able to enforce claims relating
_to a breach of the representations and warranties that the Sellers have provided to the Issuer under the_
_Be Acquisition Agreement.”_

On September 26, 2022 (the “First Be Acquisition Closing Date”), Overlord Bidco successfully
completed the Initial Acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of €238 million, which was funded
with, inter alia, a portion of the proceeds from the Bridge Facility, as further described under “—The
_Financing of the Be Acquisition” below. Following completion of the Initial Acquisition, Overlord_
Bidco held approximately 51.2% of Be’s share capital.

**_The Sellers’ Reinvestment_**

On June 19, 2022, the Company, the Issuer, TopCo, Centurion HoldCo and certain other direct and
indirect holding companies controlled by our Sponsors, entered into a reinvestment and shareholders
agreement with, among others, the Sellers (as subsequently amended from time to time, the “Be
Reinvestment and Shareholders Agreement”), pursuant to which the Sellers and certain key managers
of Be and other investors agreed to invest, through Roll-Over Holdco, an aggregate maximum amount
of up to €67.1 million (the “Sellers’ Reinvestment Amount”) in the share capital of TopCo, by way of
a severable reserved capital increase to be subscribed in one or more tranches by Roll-Over Holdco,
which was approved on August 2, 2022 by the extraordinary shareholders meeting of TopCo (the
“Sellers Reinvestment”) and subscribed in three separate tranches.

On or about the First Be Acquisition Closing Date, €65.1 million of proceeds from the Sellers’
Reinvestment, funded in two separate tranches, and received by the Issuer from TopCo via an equity
contribution provided by TopCo to the Issuer, were used, together with the relevant portion of the
proceeds from drawings under the Bridge Facility and cash on balance sheet, to fund the payment the
purchase price for the Initial Be Shares and the Additional Be Shares and pay fees and expenses in
connection therewith and in relation to the entry into and drawing of the Bridge Facility, as further
described under “—The Financing of the Be Acquisition.” The third tranche of the Seller’s
Reinvestment (€2.0 million) was funded on January 13, 2023 and such proceeds (net of fees) were
contributed through a series of equity contributions from TopCo to the Issuer and from the Issuer to the
Company.

Following completion of the Sellers’ Reinvestment, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, RollOver Holdco holds approximately 5% of TopCo’s fully diluted share capital. See “Principal
_Shareholders—Be Reinvestment and Shareholders Agreement.”_

The Be Reinvestment and Shareholders Agreement sets forth certain provisions concerning, among
other things, (i) certain corporate governance rules applicable to Be and its subsidiaries and (ii) certain


-----

rules concerning the transfer of TopCo’s shares and the potential divestment of the current direct and
indirect shareholders of the Company. See also “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure” and
“Principal Shareholders.”

In addition, pursuant to the Be Reinvestment and Shareholders Agreement, following the successful
completion of the Initial Acquisition, once commercially and operationally feasible we agreed to (i)
transfer certain ICT business activities of Be to the Group by carving out Be’s subsidiary Be Digitech
Solutions S.p.A. (excluding its advisory business unit) and integrate such activities into our Digitech
portfolio and (ii) identify a new possible “Digital Engagement Activities” commercial unit as part of
the integration of Be’s digital activities into our digital portfolio. As of the date of the Offering
Memorandum, these transactions have not yet been completed.

**_The Market Purchases, the Mandatory Offer, the Squeeze-Out and the Delisting_**

Following completion of certain additional purchases of Be’s shares pursuant to Articles 41, second
paragraph, and 42, second paragraph, of the Issuer Regulation, for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately €118 million (the “Market Purchases”) and the mandatory tender offer (the “Mandatory
Offer”) that we launched upon completion of the Initial Acquisition pursuant to Articles 102 and 106
of the Italian Financial Act on all of the then remaining outstanding shares of Be (the “MTO Be
Shares”), which we settled for an aggregate purchase price of €65 million, on December 22, 2022, i.e.,
the settlement date of the Mandatory Offer (the “MTO Settlement Date”), Overlord Bidco held a total
of 121,936,226 ordinary shares of Be which, together with Be’s 7,157,460 treasury shares, equalled to
95.7% of Be’s fully diluted share capital.

As a result of holding at least 95% of Be’s fully diluted share capital, Overlord Bidco, pursuant to
Article 111, paragraph 1, of the Italian Finance Law, purchased all of the residual 5,803,586 ordinary
shares of Be (equal to 4.3% of Be’s fully diluted share capital) from any and all minority shareholders
(the “Squeeze-Out Shares”) at a price per share equal to the Purchase Price (the “Squeeze-Out” and
together with the Initial Acquisition, the Mandatory Offer and the Market Purchases, the “Be
Acquisition”), which completed on December 28, 2022, for an aggregate purchase price of €20 million.

On December 20, 2022, the Italian stock exchange (Borsa Italiana) resolved upon the delisting of Be’s
shares from the Euronext Milan market (the “Delisting”), due to the lack of free float.

**_The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Increase_**

On or about September 19, 2022, certain lenders made available an additional facility under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of €35.0 million by way of a
fungible increase of the total commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility to €195.0
million (the “Existing Revolving Credit Facility Increase”).

**_The Financing of the Be Acquisition_**

In connection with the completion of the Initial Acquisition, on September 19, 2022, the Issuer and
Overlord Bidco, as borrowers, and the Issuer, the Company and Overlord Bidco, as guarantors, entered
into the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities Agreement, which provided for, inter alia, the Bridge Facility.
The Bridge Facility was granted by the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates. See “Plan of
_Distribution.”_

We funded the payment of the purchase price for the Initial Be Shares and the Additional Be Shares,
the Market Purchases, the MTO Be Shares and the Squeeze-Out Shares, and the payment of fees and
expenses in connection with the Be Acquisition and the financing thereof, with proceeds from drawings
under the Bridge Facility, together with a portion of the proceeds from the Sellers’ Reinvestment and
cash on balance sheet.


-----

On or around each relevant drawing date, the Issuer on-lent the net proceeds from the drawings under
the Bridge Facility (after payment of a portion of transaction fees and expenses payable by the Issuer)
to the Company, as borrower, under an intercompany funding loan made available on or about the First
Be Acquisition Closing Date by the Issuer, as lender, providing for an aggregate principal amount of
up to €385 million (the “Overlord Funding Loan I”). In turn, on or about the same date, the Company
made corresponding drawings under the Overlord Funding Loan I and on-lent such proceeds (after
payment of a portion of transaction fees and expenses payable by the Company) to Overlord Bidco by
means of a back-to-back intercompany funding loan made available on or about the First Be Acquisition
Closing Date by the Company, as lender, to Overlord Bidco, as borrower, providing for an aggregate
principal amount of up to €385 million (the “Overlord Funding Loan II” and together with the Overlord
Funding Loan I, the “Overlord Funding Loans”). In addition to the Overlord Funding Loans, the
Company made a €61 million contribution for future share capital increase (contribuzione in conto
_futuro aumento capitale) into Overlord Bidco’s equity, using cash on balance sheet. Substantially_
concurrently with the First Be Acquisition Closing Date, the Company received €65.1 million (net of
fees) of proceeds from the Sellers’ Reinvestment (equal to the cash advanced from the Company’s
balance sheet in connection with the First Be Acquisition Closing Date) which were funded to the
Company by means of a series of equity contributions for future share capital increase (contribuzione
_in conto futuro aumento capitale). In turn, on or about the First Be Acquisition Closing and the MTO_
Settlement Date, Overlord Bidco made corresponding drawings under the Overlord Funding Loan II
and used such proceeds, together with a portion of the cash received through the equity contributions
provided by the Company, to pay the purchase price of the Initial Be Shares, and the MTO Be Shares
tendered in connection with the Mandatory Offer and the Squeeze-Out Shares, repay drawings made
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and refund cash on balance sheet used indirectly to finance
the Market Purchases, and to pay the remaining portion of transaction fees and expenses payable by
Overlord Bidco. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Overlord Funding Loans.” As
of the date of this Offering Memorandum, €385 million are outstanding under each of the Overlord
Funding Loans.

**The Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger and the Be-Be Opco Merger**

Overlord Bidco holds 100% of Be’s fully diluted share capital and voting rights and the Delisting has
been achieved. As a result, we intend to (i) consummate a merger by incorporation of Overlord Bidco
into the Company (the “Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger”) and (ii) consummate a separate merger
of Be with Be Opco (the “Be-Be Opco Merger”). While there is no set timeline for either of these
mergers, we expect they will be consummated only after completion of the Engineering Merger, as
described under “—The Whitewash and the Engineering Merger” below. Upon completion of the
Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, Overlord Bidco will no longer be a separate legal entity, and
therefore will no longer be a Guarantor. In addition, the Overlord Funding Loan II, and any security
interest granted in respect of it, will cease to exist. The pledge on the shares of Overlord Bidco held by
the Company (or MergerCo, following the Engineering Merger) will also cease to exist as a result of
such merger, and the Notes will instead be secured by a pledge to be granted within ten Business Days
of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger on all the shares of Be or the entity resulting from the BeBe Opco Merger (as the case may be) held by the Company (or MergerCo, following the Engineering
Merger). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Be Acquisition—The Engineering-Overlord Bidco
_Merger will result in the release of certain security interests and Be or the resulting entity of the Be-Be_
_Opco Merger will not grant security or a Notes Guarantee in favor of the Notes.”_

**The Whitewash and the Engineering Merger**

On February 25, 2022, the Company’s board of directors authorized the Whitewash Procedure.
Subsequently, on March 28, 2022, the Company’s extraordinary shareholders’ meeting resolved upon
the implementation of the Whitewash Procedure and therefore the Company, having set aside
distributable profits and available reserves for this purpose, provided a guarantee, _inter alia, for the_
Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan, in each case, subject to applicable limitations deriving from
the Whitewash Procedure. In addition, on May 9, 2022, the Company granted a security interest over
its shares in EDH securing the Existing Notes, the Existing Term Loan and the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, in each case, subject to certain limitations as described below.

As a result of the Whitewash Procedure, the guarantee and the security interests granted by the Company
in respect of the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan are subject to a limitation with respect to
the amount that can be guaranteed and secured (as applicable) under the security interests and guarantee
in accordance with the Existing Indenture and the Existing Term Loan Agreement, respectively. In
particular, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the amounts of profits and available reserves
set aside, and therefore the amount constituting the limitation on the guarantee and the associated
security interest granted by the Company in connection with the Existing Notes and the Existing Term
Loan under the Whitewash Procedure, is currently equal to approximately €114.4 million in the
aggregate. In addition, on May 9, 2022, the Company agreed to accede as an additional borrower and
additional guarantor to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, and to be bound by the terms of the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein
(which do not include limitations under the Whitewash Procedure. Such limitations under the
Whitewash Procedure will not apply to the Collateral and Guarantees granted by the Company in respect
of the Notes). See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—Italy.”_

On the Issue Date, the Company will also guarantee the Notes. See “The Offering—Collateral.”


-----

The merger between the Issuer and the Company in accordance with Articles 2501-bis and following
of the Italian Civil Code (the “Engineering Merger”) was resolved upon by the board of directors of the
Issuer on February 22, 2023 and the board of directors of the Company on February 23, 2023 and then
resolved upon by the respective extraordinary shareholders’ meetings on March 9, 2023, promptly
thereafter with relevant filings of the required merger documents (including the merger plan, a report
by the directors of the companies involved in the Engineering Merger (relazione dell’organo
_amministrativo) and a report by an independent expert appointed by the Court of Rome, assessing the_
sustainability of debt at the level of MergerCo) with the competent authorities being made promptly
after each relevant approval. We currently expect to complete the Engineering Merger in the first half
of 2023, with retroactive effect (from a tax and accounting standpoint) from January 1, 2023. We refer
to the surviving entity of the Engineering Merger as “MergerCo.” As a result of the Engineering Merger,
MergerCo will assume the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, and the Guarantee of the Notes by the
Company is expected to be released. The Engineering Merger is subject to certain conditions and may
not be completed within the envisaged timeframe or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the Guarantees and the Security Interests—We may be unable to complete the Engineering_
_Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.” Within ten Business Days from (and excluding)_
the Engineering Merger Date, the Existing Notes and the Notes will be secured by the Post-Engineering
Merger Collateral. See also “The Offering—Security” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”

Upon consummation of the Engineering Merger and the granting of the Post-Engineering Merger
Collateral, certain of the security granted under the Initial Collateral and the Post-Issue Date Collateral
(if any) will cease to exist and the Notes will be secured by the security interests in the Post-Engineering
Merger Collateral.

See “Description of the Notes—Notes Guarantees,” “Description of the Notes—Security,” “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Once granted, the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_
_laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” and “Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and the Security Interests.”_

**Recent Developments**

**_Dismissal of the Company’s involvement in proceedings relating to the Investigation by Italian_**
**_Authorities into Tenders Involving Azienda Trasporti Milanesi S.p.A._**

On June 23, 2020, the Company received notice that an investigation was being undertaken by
authorities in Italy involving Azienda Trasporti Milanesi S.p.A. (“ATM”), the company wholly owned
by the municipality of Milan (Comune di Milano) that manages the Milan metro system, as well as eight
other companies, including the Company. The investigation involved allegations that certain public
tenders involving ATM were impacted by improper benefits provided by employees of the companies
under investigation, including seven employees of the Company, including the head of the Company’s
transportation business sub-segment, who was appointed to that position in September 2019. In
connection with the investigation, four of the Company’s employees subject to the investigation were
initially placed under house arrests and were subsequently released following the pretrial hearings for
the gathering of evidence before the beginning of the criminal proceeding (incidente probatorio) that
was held on November 4, 2020. In relation to such events, the relevant authorities have also investigated
the Company as well as the other companies for alleged violations of LD 231/2001, the Italian law on
corporate liability for crimes, and in particular corruption. In December 2021, the prosecutors
announced the completion of the preliminary investigation. On June 23, 2022, the prosecutors issued a
request of indictment (rinvio a giudizio) against certain employees subject to the investigation and
separated the proceeding related to the Company from the proceeding relating such employees pursuant
to a separation decision (provvedimento di stralcio). On November 9, 2022, the general public
prosecutor endorsed the public prosecutor’s decree (issued on September 17, 2022) to dismiss any case


-----

against the Company, thus confirming the dismissal of the Company’s position. As a result, the
Company is no longer involved in this criminal proceeding.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry— _We may incur liabilities, be restricted_
_from participating in public tenders, suffer reputational damage or be prosecuted for the actions of our_
_directors, employees, agents, representatives, advisors and intermediaries who engage in illegal_
_activities, including under LD 231/2001.”_

**Recent Trading**

Based on preliminary results derived from our unaudited management accounts and other information
currently available, we estimate that for the two months ended February 28, 2023, we generated
revenues of €248.5 million, compared to €205.8* million for the same period in 2022.

We estimate that during the two months ended February 28, 2023, demand for our products and services
was strong across all of our activity types and all of our industry verticals, particularly in our Healthcare
and Finance industry verticals. In addition, our revenues for the two months ended February 28, 2023
were driven by the integration of Be into our results following completion of the Be Acquisition, as
well as the quick start-up of the National Telemedicine Platform project, after the Group winning a 10year concession for its development in early 2023. We also estimate that our revenues for the two
months ended February 28, 2023 were impacted by lower revenues in our Public Administration
industry vertical, due to a slow start of certain PNRR projects, although we expect our activity levels
driven by the PNRR to significantly increase compared to 2022.

Furthermore, we estimate that for the two months ended February 28, 2023, we generated Adjusted
EBITDA of approximately €20 million, substantially in line with the same period in 2022*.

Key drivers of our Adjusted EBITDA for the two months ended February 28, 2023 included profitable
growth across all of our industry verticals as a result of the quick start-up of the National Telemedicine
Platform project and the positive trend recorded by Atlantic Technologies, which was offset by lower
performance of our Public Administration industry vertical, due to a slow start of certain PNRR projects,
as described above, and an increase in our overall labor cost base, including as a result of the Be
Acquisition and the general surging inflationary environment. We also estimate that our Adjusted
EBITDA for the two months ended February 28, 2023 benefitted from the cost-saving initiatives we
started to implement during 2022, in addition to those that were already undergoing, such as the rebates
programs and the real estate footprint optimization.

In the two months ended February 28, 2023, our business proved resilient on the back of continued
demand from customers, with sales bookings improving by approximately 49% from approximately
€340 million for the first two months of 2022 compared to approximately €507 million in the same
period of 2023. Our sales bookings consist of (i) revenues that we expect to generate from customer
orders in the relevant reference period, in respect to which we started providing services and which,
therefore, generate backlog in such period, and (ii) the share of revenues that is contractually guaranteed
under our multi-year framework agreements with customers with respect to a reference period,
including in advance of receiving the underlying customer orders.

In addition, we estimate that the net financial indebtedness of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of February 28, 2023 was €1.202 million, an increase of €46.7 million from €1.155
million as of January 1, 2023. These net financial indebtedness amounts reflect, among other things, (i)
the net impact on our cash position as of February 28, 2023 and January 1, 2023, from the sales of trade
receivables in the ordinary course of business we made prior to February 28, 2023 and January 1, 2023,
respectively, and (ii) the amounts of cash for R&D grants collected on behalf of our partners during the
two months ended February 28, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. For a
summary of the net debt position of the Issuer as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, please see

certain key managers of Be and other investors agreed to implement the Sellers’ Reinvestment by way of a severable
reserved capital increase to be subscribed in one or more tranches by Roll-Over Holdco. On or about the First Be
Acquisition Closing Date, €65.1 million of proceeds from the Sellers’ Reinvestment, funded in two separate tranches,
and received by the Issuer from TopCo via an equity contribution provided by TopCo to the Issuer, were used, together
with the relevant portion of the proceeds from drawings under the Bridge Facility and cash on balance sheet, to fund the
payment of the purchase price for the Initial Be Shares and the Additional Be Shares and pay fees and expenses in
connection therewith and in relation to the entry into and drawing of the Bridge Facility, as further described under “—
_The Financing of the Be Acquisition.” The third tranche of the Seller’s Reinvestment (€2.0 million) was funded on January_
13, 2023 and such proceeds (net of fees) were contributed through a series of equity contributions from TopCo to the
Issuer and from the Issuer to the Company. Following completion of the Sellers’ Reinvestment, as of the date of the
Offering Memorandum, Roll-Over Holdco holds approximately 5% of TopCo’s fully diluted share capital. See “Principal

amount of Existing PIK Notes in a private placement. The net proceeds from the offering of the Existing PIK Notes were
on-lent by TopCo to the Issuer in the form of a deeply subordinated shareholder loan to finance a portion of the purchase
price for the Engineering Acquisition. The Existing PIK Notes will mature on July 31, 2028. The Existing PIK Notes are
not guaranteed by, and do not receive any credit support from, the Issuer, the Company or their respective subsidiaries.
Interest payable under the Existing PIK Notes may be paid either through the issuance of additional PIK Notes or in cash,

(4) The Issuer is a holding company incorporated under the laws of Italy as a joint stock company (società per azioni). Since

its date of incorporation, the Issuer has not engaged in any activities other than those related to the Engineering
Acquisition and the management of the Group following the Engineering Acquisition as well as any other transactions
permitted by the Indenture. On March 28, 2022, the Company’s extraordinary shareholders’ meeting resolved upon the
implementation of the Whitewash Procedure and therefore the Company, having set aside distributable profits and
available reserves for this purpose, on April 7, 2022, provided a guarantee for the Existing Notes and the Existing Term
Loan, in each case, subject to certain limitations. As a result of the Whitewash Procedure, the guarantee and the security
interests granted by the Company in respect of the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan are subject to limitations
pursuant to the Existing Indenture and the Existing Term Loan Agreement, respectively. In particular, as of the date of
this Offering Memorandum, the amounts of profits and available reserves set aside, and therefore the amount constituting
the limitation on the guarantee and the associated security interest granted by the Company in connection with the Existing
Notes and the Existing Term Loan under the Whitewash Procedure, is currently equal to approximately €114.4 million in
the aggregate (it being understood that such limitations under the Whitewash Procedure will not apply to the Collateral
and Guarantees granted by the Company in respect of the Notes). The Engineering Merger was resolved upon by the
board of directors of the Issuer on February 22, 2023 and by the board of directors the Company on February 23, 2023,
and then resolved upon by the respective extraordinary shareholders’ meetings on March 9, 2023.We currently expect to
complete the Engineering Merger in the first half of 2023, with retroactive effect (from a tax and accounting standpoint)
from January 1, 2023. See “Description of the Notes—Engineering Merger.” The Engineering Merger is subject to certain
conditions and may not be completed within the envisaged timeframe or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the Guarantees and the Security Interests—We may be unable to complete the Engineering Merger within the_
_anticipated time frame, or at all.”_

(5) On or about September 19, 2022, certain lenders made available an additional facility under the Existing Revolving Credit

Facility Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of €35.0 million by way of a fungible increase of the total
commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, which increased to €195.0 million. See “Summary—The
_Transactions—The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Increase.” On May 9, 2022, the Company acceded as additional_
borrower and additional guarantor under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. For a description of the key terms of the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Revolving Credit
_Facility Agreement.” Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to applicable laws, the holders of Notes_
will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral (x) only after the lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full and (y) on a pari passu basis
with the holders of the Existing Notes and the lender under the Existing Term Loan.

(6) On October 8, 2020, the Issuer issued the Existing Notes pursuant to the Existing Indenture. The Existing Notes are

general, senior obligations of the Issuer and, subsequent to the Engineering Merger, MergerCo. The Issuer’s obligations
under the Existing Notes rank pari passu with the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and the Existing


-----

Term Loan. The Existing Notes are guaranteed and secured, as applicable, on the same basis as the Notes (except for the
Overlord Bidco’s guarantee which will only guarantee the Notes), the Existing Term Loan and the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Notes.”

(7) The Existing Term Loan provides for term loans in an aggregate principal amount of €38.4 million and will mature on

the final maturity date of the Existing Notes (September 30, 2026). The Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Term Loan
rank pari passu with the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the Indenture, the Existing Notes and the Existing Indenture
and is guaranteed and secured, as applicable, on the same basis as the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Term Loan Agreement.”

(8) The Issuer is offering €385.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The gross proceeds from the Offering will

be used, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i) repay in full and cancel the indebtedness incurred under the Bridge
Facility, including accrued interest thereon, and (ii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Offering and the Bridge
Facility Refinancing. See “Summary—The Transactions—The Offering and the Bridge Facility Refinancing,” and “Use
_of Proceeds.”_

(9) The Notes will be general, senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the

Issuer’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of
payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the
Existing Notes, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Term Loan. Upon the initial issuance of the Notes
on the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws,
the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior, joint and several basis by the Company and Overlord Bidco. The Guarantees
will rank _pari passu in right of payment with all of such Guarantors’ existing and future indebtedness that is not_
subordinated to such Guarantees, and will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or
obligations of each of the other subsidiaries of the Issuer that does not guarantee the Notes. Subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Company also guarantees the Issuer’s
obligations under the Existing Notes, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Term Loan, and Overlord
Bidco guarantees the Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, in each case, on a senior secured
basis. None of Be or any of its subsidiaries is expected to guarantee the Notes and, upon completion of (x) the Engineering
Merger, if any, MergerCo will assume the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Guarantee of the Notes by the
Company is expected to be released and (y) the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, the Guarantee of the Notes by
Overlord Bidco will be released. Italian law limits the amount of obligations that may be guaranteed, or in respect of
which security interests may be provided as well as the enforceability of the Guarantees and the rights to the security
securing the Notes and the Guarantees. By virtue of such limitations, the Guarantors’ obligations under the Guarantees
are significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or the Guarantors may have effectively no
obligations under their Guarantees. The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain material limitations
pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the_
Issuer and the Guarantors, before intercompany eliminations, accounted for 59.4% of the revenue and 55.9% of the
consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the Group, after giving _pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had been_
completed on January 1, 2022, and accounted for 68.1% of the consolidated total assets of the Group. As of December
31, 2022, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and the Guarantors would have had €34.5 million of third
party indebtedness (other than the Notes, the Existing Notes, amounts drawn under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
and the Existing Term Loan), none of which was secured over assets other than the Collateral.

(10) On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection

requirements, by the Initial Collateral. Within 30 days from (and excluding) the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Post-Issue Date Collateral; provided
_that if the Engineering Merger becomes effective prior to the date on which the Post-Issue Date Collateral has been_
granted, the Notes (x) will not be secured by the Post-Issue Date Collateral and (y) will instead be secured, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral within the
later of 30 days from (and excluding) the Issue Date and ten Business Days from (and excluding) the Engineering Merger
Date. Within ten Business Days from (and excluding) the Engineering Merger Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to
the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral. Subject
to the Agreed Security Principles, the Initial Collateral and the Post-Issue Date Collateral also secures, and following the
Engineering Merger, the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral will secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Notes,
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations (if any) and the Existing Term Loan on a pari passu
basis. Each of the Initial Collateral, the Post-Issue Date Collateral and the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral is further
described under “Description of the Notes—Security.” Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to
applicable laws, the holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral (x) only after the
lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been
repaid in full and (y) on a pari passu basis with the holders of the Existing Notes and the lender under the Existing Term
Loan. Any remaining proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied pro rata to the
repayment of all obligations under the Indenture and any other senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the
Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by such Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement. The security interests in the Collateral will be limited by applicable law and subject to certain defenses that


-----

may limit their validity and enforceability and may be released under certain circumstances. For further information, see
“Description of the Notes—Security,” “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.” Subject to and as set forth in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the_
Issuer will not be liable to pay any Additional Amounts to holders of the Notes in relation to any withholding or deduction
required pursuant to Decree No. 239, if the Notes are held by a person resident in a country that is not included in the list
issued under Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239, and otherwise in the circumstances as described in “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes.”_

(11) On July 23, 2020, in connection with the Engineering Acquisition, the Issuer, as lender, and the Company, as borrower,

entered into the Existing Funding Loan. A portion of the proceeds from the Existing Funding Loan was used to refinance
certain indebtedness of the Company in connection with the Engineering Acquisition. As of December 31, 2022,
approximately €114.4 million in aggregate principal amount were outstanding under the Existing Funding Loan. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security Interests—The principal amount of the
_Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loans forming part of the Collateral may be less than anticipated as a_
_result of prepayments of certain indebtedness of the Group prior to the maturity date of the Notes” and “Description of_
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Funding Loan.”_

(12) On or about the First Be Acquisition Closing Date, in order to distribute the proceeds from the Bridge Facility, from the

Issuer to Overlord Bidco to be used in connection with the Transactions, we entered into the Overlord Funding Loans,
consisting of (i) the Overlord Funding Loan I, a first intercompany loan agreement by and between the Issuer, as lender,
and the Company, as borrower, providing for an aggregate principal amount of up to €385 million, and (ii) the Overlord
Funding Loan II, a second back-to-back intercompany loan agreement entered by and between the Company, as lender,
and Overlord Bidco, as borrower, providing for an aggregate principal amount of up to €385 million. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Overlord Funding Loans.” On or around each relevant drawing date under the Bridge_
Facility in connection with the Be Acquisition, the Issuer on-lent the net proceeds from such drawings (after payment of
a portion of transaction fees and expenses payable by the Issuer) to the Company, as borrower, under the Overlord Funding
Loan I. In turn, on or about the same date, the Company made corresponding drawings under the Overlord Funding Loan
I and on-lent such proceeds (after payment of a portion of transaction fees and expenses payable by the Company) to
Overlord Bidco by means of the Overlord Funding Loan II. In addition to the Overlord Funding Loans, the Issuer also
funded approximately additional €61 million of cash to the Company, which in turn contributed the funds received to
Overlord Bidco’s equity, using cash on balance sheet. In turn, on or about the First Be Acquisition Closing and the MTO
Settlement Date, Overlord Bidco made corresponding drawings under the Overlord Funding Loan II and used such
proceeds, together with a portion of the cash received through the equity contributions provided by the Company, to pay
the purchase price of the Initial Be Shares, and the MTO Be Shares tendered in connection with the Mandatory Offer and
the Squeeze-Out Shares, and to pay the remaining portion of transaction fees and expenses payable by Overlord Bidco.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Overlord Funding Loans.” See also “Summary—The
_Transactions—The Financing of the Be Acquisition.” As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, €385 million are_
outstanding under each of the Overlord Funding Loans.

(13) Overlord Bidco is a holding company incorporated under the laws of Italy as a joint stock company (società per azioni)

and designated as purchaser pursuant to the Be Acquisition Agreement. Overlord Bidco has no independent business
operations, other than those in connection with its incorporation and the Be Acquisitions, and has no material assets or
any revenue generating assets. Overlord Bidco is currently not expected to engage in any activities other than those related
to the Be Acquisition and any other transactions permitted by the Indenture. Be is a joint stock company organized and
existing under the laws of Italy. Following the successful completion of the Be Acquisition, Overlord Bidco owns 100%
of Be’s share capital. As a result, we intend to (i) consummate the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger and (ii) Be-Be
Opco Merger. While there is no set timeline for either of these mergers, we expect they will be consummated only after
completion of the Engineering Merger. Upon completion of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, Overlord Bidco
will no longer be a separate legal entity, and therefore will no longer be a Guarantor. In addition, the Overlord Funding
Loan II, and any security interest granted in respect of it, will cease to exist. The pledge on the shares of Overlord Bidco
held by the Company (or MergerCo, following the Engineering Merger) will also cease to exist as a result of such merger,
and the Notes will instead be secured by a pledge to be granted within ten Business Days of the Engineering-Overlord
Bidco Merger on all the shares of Be or the entity resulting from the Be-Be Opco Merger (as the case may be) held by
the Company (or MergerCo, following the Engineering Merger). See “Summary—The Transactions—The Engineering_Overlord Bidco Merger and the Be-Be Opco Merger.”_

(14) None of the subsidiaries of the Company other than Overlord Bidco is expected to guarantee the Notes. Upon completion

of (x) the Engineering Merger, if any, MergerCo will assume the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Guarantee
of the Notes by the Company is expected to be released and (y) the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, the Guarantee
of the Notes by Overlord Bidco will be released. As of December 31, 2022, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions,
the subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not guarantee the Notes would have had €62.2 million of third party indebtedness
outstanding, all of which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and the Existing Notes and none of which
was secured by assets other than the Collateral. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Security Interests—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of_
_each of the subsidiaries of Issuer (or MergerCo, as applicable) that does not guarantee the Notes.” Certain subsidiaries_


-----

of the Issuer are not wholly owned (directly or indirectly) by the Issuer. In certain cases, the minority shareholders of
such subsidiaries have contractual arrangements with us pursuant to which they may, following the exercise of put options
under such contractual arrangements and subject to certain conditions and timing requirements, require us to purchase
their minority stake. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of our liabilities in connection with such put options
amounted to €2.6 million. For further information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and_
_Industry—Certain of our subsidiaries have non-controlling shareholders whose interests may differ from ours. In_
_addition, the contractual arrangements with such non-controlling shareholders may require us to purchase shares at_
_predetermined prices under certain put and call options and to make payments under certain earn-out arrangements.”_

the subsidiaries of the Issuer that does not guarantee the

Bidco guarantees the Issuer’s obligations under the


-----

Existing Revolving Credit Facility, in each case, on a
senior secured basis.

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the
Issuer and the Guarantors, before intercompany
eliminations, accounted for 59.4% of the revenue and
55.9% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the
Group, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions
as if they had been completed on January 1, 2022, and
accounted for 68.1% of the consolidated total assets of
the Group. As of December 31, 2022, adjusted to give
effect to the Transactions the Issuer and the Guarantors
would have had €34.5 million of third party
indebtedness (other than the Notes, the Existing Notes,
amounts drawn under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility and the Existing Term Loan), none of which
was secured over assets other than the Collateral.

The Guarantees will be subject to certain contractual
and legal limitations, as described under “Description
_of the Notes—The Notes Guarantees” and “Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests.” By virtue of these limitations, the_
Guarantors’ obligation under their Guarantees will be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to
the Notes, or the Guarantors may have effectively no
obligation under their Guarantees. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the_
_Security_ _Interests—Corporate_ _benefit,_ _financial_

_assistance laws, capital maintenance and other_
_limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may_
_adversely affect the validity and Enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral,” “Risk Factors—Risk_
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral—Once granted, the Guarantees and_
_the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or_
_subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity_
_and_ _enforceability,”_ “Certain _Insolvency_ _Law_

_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests,” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Existing Revolving Credit Facility_
_Agreement.”_

None of the subsidiaries of the Company other than
Overlord Bidco is expected to guarantee the Notes.

Upon completion of (x) the Engineering Merger, if any,
MergerCo will assume the Issuer’s obligations under
the Notes and the Guarantee of the Notes by the
Company is expected to be released and (y) the


-----

Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, the Guarantee of
the Notes by Overlord Bidco will be released.

In addition, the Guarantees may also be released under
the circumstances described in “Description of the
_Notes—The Notes Guarantee—Notes Guarantees_
_Release.”_

As of December 31, 2022, adjusted to give effect to the
Transactions, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not
guarantee the Notes would have had €62.2 million of
third party indebtedness outstanding, all of which
would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and
the Existing Notes and none of which was secured by
assets other than the Collateral.

**Ranking of the Guarantees......................** Each Guarantee will upon its issuance by the relevant

Guarantor:

                    - be a senior obligation of that Guarantor;

                    - rank _pari passu in right of payment with any_
existing and future indebtedness of that
Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in
right of payment to its Guarantee, including
that Guarantor’s guarantee of the Existing
Notes (which will mature on September 30,
2026), the Existing Revolving Credit Facility,
certain hedging obligations related thereto (if
any) and the Existing Term Loan (which will
mature on September 30, 2026);

                    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing
and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that
is expressly subordinated to its Guarantee;

                    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or
future indebtedness or obligation of that
Guarantor that is secured by property and
assets that do not secure its Guarantee, or
which secures such other indebtedness on a
super senior basis (including obligations under
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility

Agreement and certain hedging obligations
related thereto (if any)), to the extent of the
value of the property and assets securing such
other indebtedness or obligation; and

                    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or
future indebtedness or obligations of each of
the other subsidiaries of the Issuer that does not
guarantee the Notes, including obligations
owed to trade creditors of such subsidiary.

**Security .....................................................** On or about the Issue Date, subject to certain perfection

requirements, the Notes will be secured, subject to the


-----

Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection
requirements, by the Initial Collateral.

Within 30 days from (and excluding) the Issue Date,
the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles and certain perfection requirements,
by the Post-Issue Date Collateral; provided that if the
Engineering Merger becomes effective prior to the date
on which the Post-Issue Date Collateral has been
granted, the Notes (x) will not be secured by the PostIssue Date Collateral and (y) will instead be secured,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain
perfection requirements, by the Post-Engineering
Merger Collateral within the later of 30 days from (and
excluding) the Issue Date and ten Business Days from
(and excluding) the Engineering Merger Date.

Within ten Business Days from (and excluding) the
Engineering Merger Date, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles and certain perfection requirements,
the Notes will be secured by the Post-Engineering
Merger Collateral.

Upon consummation of the Engineering Merger and
the granting of the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral,
certain of the security granted under the Initial
Collateral and the Post-Issue Date Collateral (if any)
will cease to exist and the Notes will be secured by the
security interests in the Post-Engineering Merger
Collateral. Each of the Initial Collateral, the Post-Issue
Date Collateral and the Post-Engineering Merger
Collateral is further described under “Description of the
_Notes—Security.”_

Upon completion of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco
Merger, Overlord Bidco will no longer be a separate
legal entity, and therefore the Overlord Funding Loan
II, and any security interest granted in respect of it, will
cease to exist. The pledge on the shares of Overlord
Bidco held by the Company (or MergerCo, following
the Engineering Merger) will also cease to exist as a
result of such merger, and the Notes will instead be
secured by a pledge to be granted within ten Business
Days of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger on all
the shares of Be or the entity resulting from the Be-Be
Opco Merger (as the case may be) held by the Company
(or MergerCo, following the Engineering Merger).

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain
material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the
Initial Collateral and the Post-Issue Date Collateral also
secure (if any), and following the Engineering Merger,
the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral will secure the
Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Notes, the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging


-----

obligations (if any) and the Existing Term Loan on
a pari passu basis.

In the event of an enforcement in respect of the
Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive
proceeds from such Collateral only after lenders under
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and

counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any)
have been repaid in full. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests—Creditors under the Existing Revolving_
_Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging_
_obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be_
_incurred under the terms of the Indenture, the Existing_
_Indenture, the Existing Term Loan Agreement and the_
_Intercreditor Agreement on a “super senior” basis are_
_entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the_
_enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes,_
_the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan,” “Risk_
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral—Once granted, the Guarantees and_
_the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or_
_subject to certain defenses that may limit_ _their validity_
_and enforceability,” and “Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests.”_

The security interests may be limited by applicable law
or subject to certain defenses that may limit their
validity and enforceability. In addition, the security
interests in the Collateral may be released under certain
circumstances. Subject to the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral may be pledged
to secure future indebtedness. For more information on
the security interests granted, see “Description of the
_Notes—Security” and for more information on potential_
limitations to the security interests, see “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to_
_the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**Engineering Merger .................................** The merger between the Issuer and the Company in

accordance with Articles 2501-bis and following of the
Italian Civil Code was resolved upon by the board of
directors of the Issuer on February 22, 2023 and the
board of directors of the Company on February 23,
2023, and then resolved upon by the respective
extraordinary shareholders’ meetings on March 9,
2023. We currently expect to complete the Engineering
Merger in the first half of 2023, with retroactive effect
(from a tax and accounting standpoint) from January 1,
2023. We refer to the surviving entity of the


-----

Engineering Merger as “MergerCo.” See “Description
_of the Notes—Certain Covenants—The Engineering_
_Merger.” The Engineering Merger is subject to certain_
conditions and may not be completed within the
envisaged timeframe or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests—We may be unable to complete the_
_Engineering Merger within the anticipated time frame,_
_or at all.”_

**Use of Proceeds .........................................** The gross proceeds from the Offering will be used,

together with cash on balance sheet, to (i) repay in full
and cancel the indebtedness incurred under the Bridge
Facility, including accrued interest thereon and (ii) pay
fees and expenses in connection with the Offering and
the Bridge Facility Refinancing. See “Summary—The
_Transactions—The Offering and the Bridge Facility_
_Refinancing” and “Use of Proceeds.”_

**Optional Redemption ...............................** Prior to     , 2025, the Issuer will be entitled, at its

option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the date of redemption, and Additional
Amounts, if any, plus a “make whole” premium, as
described under “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption.”_

Prior to     , 2025, the Issuer may redeem up to 10%
of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
originally issued (including the aggregate principal
amount of any additional Notes issued) in each calendar
year at a redemption price equal to 103% of the
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, and
Additional Amounts, if any. In addition, prior to     ,
2025, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, up to 40%

**Additional Amounts .................................** All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any

Guarantor under or with respect to the Notes or the
relevant Guarantee will be made without withholding
or deduction for taxes or other governmental charges,
except to the extent required by law. If withholding or
deduction is required by law in any Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (as defined in “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes”), the Issuer or the relevant_


-----

Guarantor will pay additional amounts so that the net
amount you receive is no less than that which you
would have received in the absence of such withholding
or deduction, subject to certain exceptions (the
“Additional Amounts”). See “Description of the
_Notes— Withholding Taxes.”_

**Tax Redemption .......................................** If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing

Jurisdiction become effective that would impose
withholding taxes or other deductions on the payments
on the Notes, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in
whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price
of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of redemption, and
Additional Amounts, if any. See “Description of the
_Notes— Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”_

**Change of Control ....................................** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a

change of control, the Issuer may be required to make
an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
the purchase. See “Description of the Notes—Change
_of Control.”_

**Tender Offers ...........................................** In connection with certain tender offers for any series

of Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such
series validly tender and do not withdraw the Notes in
such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party
making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer,
purchases all of the Notes of such series validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such holders of Notes,
the Issuer or such third party will have the right to
redeem the Notes of such series that remain outstanding
in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a
price equal to the price offered to each other holder of
Notes in such offer. See “Description of the Notes—
_Optional Redemption—General.”_

**Certain Covenants ...................................** The Indenture limits the ability of the Issuer, its

restricted subsidiaries and, in certain cases, TopCo to:

                    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and
issue certain preferred stock;

                    - pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our
capital stock;

                    - make certain restricted payments;

                    - make certain investments;

                    - create or permit to exist certain liens;


-----

                    - impose restrictions on the ability of our
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other
payments to us;

                    - merge or consolidate with other entities, or
make certain asset sales;

                    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

                    - impair the security interests for the benefit of
the holders of the Notes; and

                    - guarantee certain indebtedness.

Certain of the covenants and events of default will be
suspended if and for so long as we achieve investmentgrade ratings. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Suspension of Covenants and Release of_
_Notes Security Interests on Achievement of Investment_
_Grade Status.”_

Each of the covenants in the Indenture are subject to
significant exceptions and qualifications. See

“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**Original Issue Discount ...........................** If the stated principal amount of the relevant series of

Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount greater
than or equal to a statutorily defined _de minimis_
amount, then the Notes of such series will be
considered to be issued with original issue discount
(“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S.
Holder (as defined in “Certain _Taxation_

_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax_
_Considerations”) generally will be required to include_
such OID in gross income as ordinary income as it
accrues on a constant yield basis for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, generally in advance of the
receipt of the cash payments to which such OID is
attributable and regardless of such U.S. Holder’s
regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. See “Certain Taxation Considerations—
_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**Transfer Restrictions ...............................** Neither the Notes nor the Guarantees have been

registered under the Securities Act or the securities
laws of any other jurisdiction nor will they be so
registered. The Notes are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale. See “Notice to Investors.”
Holders of the Notes will not have the benefit of any
exchange or registration rights.

**Exchange ...................................................** The Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

## SUMMARY HISTORICAL AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL DATA

_The following tables set forth our summary consolidated financial information and other data for the_
_years ended and as of the dates indicated below. Our historical summary consolidated financial_
_information set forth below as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 has been derived_
_from the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022,_
_which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Certain of the performance indicators and_
_ratios shown below were taken from our accounting records and are not included in the 2022 Audited_
_Financial Statements._

_We have also presented summary unaudited as adjusted consolidated financial and other data prepared_
_to give effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022, in the case of summary_
_unaudited as adjusted consolidated income statement information, and December 31, 2022, in the case_
_of summary unaudited as adjusted consolidated balance sheet information. The summary unaudited as_
_adjusted consolidated financial and other data is presented for informational purposes only and does_
_not purport to represent what our actual interest expense actually would have been if the Transactions_
_had occurred on January 1, 2022, or what our actual net debt position would have been had the_
_Transactions occurred on December 31, 2022, or on any other date, and such data does not purport to_
_project our financial results for any future period._

_The summary consolidated financial information below includes certain non-IFRS measures that we_
_use to evaluate our economic and financial performance. These measures are not identified as_
_accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered a substitute for, or superior_
_to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS or those calculated using_
_financial measures that are prepared in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and_
_Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures.”_

_As a result of the correction of the accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and_
_Other Information—Accounting Errors” in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the inability of_

- As a result of the correction of the accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—
_Accounting Errors” in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the inability of the Issuer to allocate the effects of such_
errors to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2022, the consolidated financial information as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2022 is not fully comparable with the financial information as of and for the year ended December
31, 2021, in each case, derived from the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and presented in the table above. In particular,
the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 presented in the table above is impacted by the
accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors,” and therefore
you should not place undue reliance on such information. See also Note 1.1 to our 2022 Audited Financial Statements
describing the correction of major errors under IAS 8, and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—
_We identified certain accounting errors that occurred prior to 2022, which resulted in an overstatement of the Company’s_

(a) These capital expenditure figures are audited.

(1) We define organic revenue growth as the percentage growth in Group revenue between two periods (the later of such

periods, the “subsequent period”), excluding from the subsequent period the contribution to the Group’s revenue by
entities that were acquired by the Group during such period. Organic revenue growth is not a measure presented in
accordance with IFRS. When assessing our operating performance, you should not consider this data in isolation or as a
substitute for our revenue growth that is calculated in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information—Non-IFRS Measures.” If we excluded revenues generated in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022_
in our Finance industry vertical, which recorded a lower performance in 2022 also as a result of the impact from the
accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors,” our 2022
organic revenue growth would have been 10.0%. Furthermore, if from such organic revenue growth we also excluded


-----

revenues generated by Movilitas, which we acquired at the end of 2021, from our revenues for the year ended December
31, 2022, our 2022 organic revenue growth would have been 5.6%.

(2) We define Adjusted EBITDA as net profit from continuing operations before income taxes, income (expenses) from

investments, financial income, financial expense (excluding interests on lease liabilities), interest on lease liabilities,
depreciation of right-of-use assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets,
impairment of assets, and further adjusted for the effects of certain events and transactions that management considers to
be unrelated to our underlying trading performance, including stock option costs, retirement incentives, audit costs, nonordinary charges related to the OverIT spin-off, charges for corporate transactions, non-income tax assessment costs and
corporate strategic assessment expenses. We define Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA for the
year ended December 31, 2022, as further adjusted to include (i) the Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31,
2022 of certain companies acquired in 2022 to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for the
year ended December 31, 2022, based on the respective financial statements and/or management accounts of such entities,
(ii) the expected run rate impact from certain cost saving measures that we started implementing in 2022 and that we
expect to fully realize by the end of 2023 as if such measures had been fully implemented on January 1, 2022, based on
management’s assumptions regarding the impact of such measures, (iii) the Adjusted EBITDA of Be for the year ended
December 31, 2022 to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31,
2022, based on its financial statements presented in accordance with IFRS, as if Be had been fully consolidated in our
financial statements on January 1, 2022, and (iv) the estimated effect on our results of certain cost savings that we expect
to generate following completion of the Be Acquisition through cost savings synergies from the integration of the Be
Group into our business that we expect to fully realize by the end of 2024 as if Be had been fully consolidated in our
financial statements from, and such measures had been fully implemented on, January 1, 2022, based on management’s
assumptions regarding the impact of such synergies, in each case, as if such acquisitions had been completed, and such
initiatives, measures and cost savings synergies had been fully implemented, as of January 1, 2022. Management believes
that adjustments relating to certain expenses and income were necessary in order to ensure a better comparability of the
historical data relating to the financial years in question as these include items not considered by management to be
attributable to the normal operational management of our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful metric for
investors to understand our results of operations and profitability because it permits investors to evaluate our recurring
profitability from underlying operating activities. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors
with a tool to compare the historical performance of our business across different periods as our adjustments to net profit
from continuing operations and the exclusion of certain costs and expenses include items not considered by management
to be attributable to the day-to-day operation of our business. We believe Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA is a
useful metric for investors to understand our results of operations and profitability because it gives pro forma effect to
the Be Acquisition and certain cost savings synergies which we expect to generate from the integration of the Be Group
into our business, in each case, as if they had been completed on January 1, 2022. We also use these measures internally
to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor our business, as well as evaluating our
underlying historical performance. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA
may be different from the presentation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. Adjusted
EBITDA and Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA are Non-IFRS Measures and the terms Adjusted EBITDA and Pro
Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA are not defined under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles.
Consequently, the use of Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations. Adjusted
EBITDA and Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of net income, operating income, operating
performance or liquidity presented in accordance with IFRS. When assessing our operating performance, you should not
consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income, operating income or any other operating performance
or liquidity measure that is calculated in accordance with IFRS. Neither our independent auditors, nor any other
independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the presentation of, Pro
Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance
on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, such
presentation. For a more detailed description of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted
EBITDA as analytical tools, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures.” See also “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We have made and may make acquisitions or enter into_
_transactions that may present risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at_

 - As a result of the correction of the accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting

_Errors” in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the inability of the Issuer to allocate the effects of such errors to periods prior_
to the year ended December 31, 2022, the consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 is not

Audited Financial Statements and presented in the table above. In particular, the financial information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2021 presented in the table above is impacted by the accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and
_Other Information—Accounting Errors,” and therefore you should not place undue reliance on such information. See also Note 1.1_
to our 2022 Audited Financial Statements describing the correction of major errors under IAS 8, and “Risk Factors—Risks Related

_exercise caution when comparing our results of operations and balance sheet assets among the periods under review in this Offering_
_Memorandum, and in particular those relating to our Finance industry vertical.”_

(a) The increase in provisions from 2021 to 2022 primarily relates to certain write-offs related to the accounting errors described under

“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors” and Note 1.1 to our 2022 Audited Financial Statements
describing the correction of major errors under IAS 8.

(b) The decrease in retirement incentives / change of management primarily relates to higher expenses made in 2021 in connection the

changes in the composition of our senior management team, including expenses related to the departure of our former Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer and to the hiring of our new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

(c) Represents (i) one-off charges for the strategic assessment of the Group and capitalized expenses for due diligence activities carried

out by external professional service providers in connection with the acquisition of Design Automation Associates, LiveBox,
Movilitas, Nexera, C Consulting and Movilitas during the year ended December 31, 2021, and the acquisitions of Atlantic
Technologies, PluSure and Be in the year ended December 31, 2022 and (ii) for the year ended December 31, 2022, legal expenses
related to the investigation of the accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting
_Errors” and Note 1.1 to our 2022 Audited Financial Statements describing the correction of major errors under IAS 8._

(d) Represents one-off advisory expenses and charges for due diligence activities carried out by external professional service providers

for the year ended December 31, 2021 incurred in connection with the spin-off of OverIT, which exited the consolidation perimeter
of the Group with effect from December 1, 2021. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition of
_Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Acquisitions and Disposals.”_

(e) Represents one-off charges incurred in connection with the acquisition of non-controlling interests in certain companies. See

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and
_Financial Condition—Acquisitions and Disposals.”_


-----

(f) Represents a positive adjustment reflecting the deconsolidation of the negative adjusted EBITDA of OverIT for the year ended

December 31, 2021, following OverIT’s spin-off in such year.

(g) Represents the estimated Adjusted EBITDA contribution for the year ended December 31, 2022 of the following companies acquired

by the Group in 2022, to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022:
PluSure S.p.A. and Atlantic Technologies S.p.A., derived from their respective financial statements and/ or management accounts,
as applicable, for the periods indicated. This adjustment is presented by management with the purpose of showing, on an illustrative
basis, the operating performance of the Group, as if such companies and business units had been consolidated into the Group’s results
as of January 1, 2022. However, there can be no assurance that the estimated Adjusted EBITDA of such entities was calculated on
the same basis and using the same accounting policies that we do. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties
and may not give an accurate or complete representation of the actual contribution of these acquired and disposed entities to the
Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for the period presented. This adjustment is presented for informational purposes only and does not
purport to project Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA for any future period. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Acquisitions and_
_Disposals.”_

(h) Represents the estimated run rate impact on our Adjusted EBITDA of certain cost savings initiatives that we have started

implementing in 2022 with the aim of further streamlining our operations and achieve annual run rate cost savings, which we expect
to realize fully by the end of 2023 (excluding €9.8 million of cost savings we already achieved for the year ended December 31, 2022
that are therefore not included in this adjustment), based on management’s assumptions regarding the impact of such actions in the
year ended December 31, 2022, as if such actions and initiatives had been fully implemented as of January 1, 2022, consisting of (in
aggregate, including both cost savings already achieved in 2022 and cost savings expected to be achieved in 2023) (A) procurement
initiatives, comprising: (i) €10.0 million of estimated run rate cost savings from the streamlining of our contractual relationships with
external IT consultants through the introduction of (x) competitive tender procedures, and (y) a structured supplier qualification
process, which we started implementing in the first and second quarter of 2022, respectively; (ii) €3.0 million of estimated run rate
cost savings from the reduction of costs related to the procurement of software products, primarily by consolidating our current
software providers base, and consolidating our IT spend with certain selected OEMs, which we started implementing in each case in
the second quarter of 2022 (€4.0 million of which have been already achieved as of December 31, 2022); (B) €1.6 million of estimated
run rate cost savings from optimization initiatives targeting the reduction of utilities, maintenance and rent costs related to our real
estate portfolio, including the reduction of our square footage at multiple locations and office closures in up to three out of 13 nonstrategic locations in Italy as well as the opening of a new Group flagship office in Milan (Italy), which we started implementing in
the second quarter of 2022 (€1.2 million of which have been already achieved as of December 31, 2022); and (C) €4.6 million of run
rate cost savings, all of which have been already achieved for the year ended December 31, 2022) from a broad range of other cost
saving initiatives, including the outsourcing of payroll activities, the implementation of headcount optimization and reduction projects
including nearshoring activities in Serbia and adjacent countries, rationalization projects aimed at consolidating our legal structure,
and vendor rebate management activities, which we started implementing in part in the first quarter of 2022. Once achieved, we
expect that these cost savings will structurally reduce the Group’s cost base going forward. We incurred approximately €2.5 million
of one-off costs in connection with the achievement of these cost savings, primarily related to the involvement of a third party supplier
with proven expertise in technology procurement and supply chain dynamics, and we expect to only incur further de minimis costs
for the achievement thereof. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and may not give an accurate or complete
representation of the financial impact or results of these actions and initiatives for the period presented. The achievement of these
cost savings partly depends on factors that are outside of our control, including the renegotiation of certain contract terms with our
vendors, suppliers and business partners, and we may therefore be unable to implement some or all of such initiatives and/or generate
the expected benefits therefrom within the expected timeframe or at all. For a more detailed description of our cost saving initiatives
please see, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of
_Operations and Financial Condition—Our Cost Structure and Cost Saving Initiatives.” See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to_
_Our Business and Industry—Our cost saving measures may prove to be ineffective” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our_

(i) Represents the Adjusted EBITDA of Be for the year ended December 31, 2022, to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s

Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022, as if Be had been fully consolidated into our results on January 1, 2022,
calculated on the basis of the financial statements of Be presented in accordance with IFRS and aligned to our own accounting policies
in order to ensure comparability with our key financial information. A large portion of Be Group’s revenues is generated from the
same subset of customers targeted by our Finance industry vertical, and certain solutions, consulting services or products currently
offered by the Be Group might overlap with products and solutions part of our Finance industry vertical portfolio. As a result,
combining our Adjusted EBITDA with Be’s Adjusted EBITDA may not provide a reliable indication of our combined results going
forward if sales of certain of Be Group’s products and solutions were to result in decreased sales generated from our Finance industry
vertical or vice versa. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We and the Be Group offer products and
_solutions which may compete with each other.” See also “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Financial Information_
_of Be” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We may not realize any or all of the adjustments to Pro_
_Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA included in the Offering Memorandum.”_

(j) Represents the estimated future impact on our Adjusted EBITDA from certain cost savings that we expect to generate following

completion of the Be Acquisition, through cost savings synergies from the integration of the Be Group into our business that we
expect to fully realize by the end of 2024, based on management’s assumptions, as if the relevant actions and initiatives had been
fully implemented as of January 1, 2022. Once achieved, we expect that these cost savings will structurally reduce the Group’s cost
base going forward. In connection with the achievement of these cost savings synergies, on the basis of management estimates, we
expect that we will incur one-off costs of approximately €5.0 million in 2023 and €10.0 million in 2024. We expect to realize these
cost savings through the following initiatives: (A) initiatives consisting of: (i) the optimization of our subcontractor and procurement
relationships, (ii) the optimization of external workforce utilization rates, and (iii) the deployment of near-shoring initiatives, (B) the
optimization and consolidation of the Group’s and Be’s combined real estate footprint and related costs including initiatives targeted


-----

at (i) the full consolidation of Be’s Rome offices into the Group’s Rome headquarters, (ii) the partial consolidation of Be’s current
Milan offices into the Group’s new flagship Milan office, and (iii) additional optimization initiatives to be implemented in further
locations with potential footprint overlaps, such as Turin and Vicenza, (C) the consolidation of the Group’s and Be’s staff and
administrative functions, and (D) the reduction of compliance expenses following the Delisting of the Be Group upon completion of
the Be Acquisition. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and may not give an accurate or complete picture
of the financial impact or results of these actions and initiatives for the period presented. The achievement of these cost savings partly
depends on factors that are outside of our control, and we may be unable to implement some or all of such initiatives and/or generate
the expected benefits therefrom within the expected timeframe or at all. For a more detailed description of cost savings synergies that
we expect to generate from the integration of the Be Group into our business, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Our Cost Structure and_
_Cost Saving Initiatives.” See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our cost saving measures may prove_
_to be ineffective” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We may not realize any or all of the adjustments_
_to Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA included in the Offering Memorandum.”_

(3) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues, expressed as a percentage.

(4) We define capital expenditure as purchase of property, plant and equipment plus purchase of intangible assets. Capital

expenditure excludes the consideration paid by us for the acquisition of other businesses. Capital expenditure is not a
measure recognized by IFRS. For further information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition of Operations—Capital expenditures.” See also “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS_
_Measures.”_

accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors,” and therefore you should
not place undue reliance on such information. See also Note 1.1 to our 2022 Audited Financial Statements describing the correction
of major errors under IAS 8, and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We identified certain accounting

(5) We define cash conversion as (x) Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure divided by (y) Adjusted EBITDA, expressed

as a percentage. We define Pro Forma cash conversion as Pro Forma free cash flow divided by Pro Forma Run Rate
Adjusted EBITDA, expressed as a percentage. Cash conversion and Pro Forma cash conversion are not measures of net
income, operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with IFRS. When assessing our
operating performance, you should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income, operating
income or any other operating performance or liquidity measure that is calculated in accordance with IFRS. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures.”

(6) We define net working capital as current customer contract assets, inventories, deferred contract costs, trade receivables

and other current assets less current trade payables, other current liabilities, current tax payables and current provisions
for risks and charges. We define adjusted net working capital as net working capital, as adjusted for certain effects that
management does not consider representative of the ongoing operations of the Group.

(a) The following adjustments remove the effects on our net working capital of certain non-cash and other charges, which we do not

believe to be indicative of operational changes in our net working capital. In particular, we have adjusted our net working capital to
remove the effects of our ongoing dispute with Sicilia Digitale and Regione Siciliana on our trade receivables and trade payables,
which we deem not to be representative of the changes in our net working capital as a result of our operations. See also “Business—
_Legal Proceedings.”_

(b) Other adjustments represents non-cash items affecting net working capital for the year ended December 31, 2022, including (i) an

overstatement of balance sheet assets as of January 1, 2022 of €46.0 million, (ii) specific provisions made for €7.0 million on some
positions relating to assets accrued mainly in previous years and not invoiced (both (i) and (ii) being incurred in connection with the
accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors”), and (iii) generic
provisions made for €22.8 million in connection with the adoption of a new receivables policy.

(c) Change in adjusted net working capital represents the difference in adjusted net working capital as of the specified date compared to

adjusted net working capital as of the comparable prior date.

Net working capital and adjusted net working capital are not measures of net income, operating income, operating performance or
liquidity presented in accordance with IFRS. When assessing our operating performance, you should not consider this data in isolation
or as a substitute for our net income, operating income or any other operating performance or liquidity measure that is calculated in

acquired in 2022 to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022),
expressed as a percentage. Aggregated revenues of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2022 were €1,636.8

(10) As adjusted cash and cash equivalents reflects the cash and cash equivalents of the Group as of December 31, 2022

adjusted to remove (i) the amount of cash for R&D grants collected on behalf of our partners (€31.8 million) and (ii) the
amount of cash collected on behalf of factors with respect to trade receivables sold to such factors and other restricted
cash (€25.8 million), which therefore does not belong to the Group, in each case as of December 31, 2022. In addition,
as adjusted cash and cash equivalents reflects the use of the gross proceeds from this Offering assuming issuance at par
(€385.0 million), together with €11.0 million of cash on balance sheet, to (i) repay in full and cancel the indebtedness
incurred under the Bridge Facility, including estimated accrued and unpaid interest on the Bridge Facility through (and
including) the Issue Date (€390.0 million) and (ii) pay estimated fees and expenses in connection with the Offering and
the Bridge Facility Refinancing (€6.0 million). See “Use of Proceeds.” From time to time following the date of this
Offering Memorandum, we may repay a portion of Be’s existing indebtedness using cash on balance sheet and/or
drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. As adjusted cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022
does not include any other adjustments to our cash and cash equivalents due to working capital expansion or contraction
or any other cash generation or utilization since December 31, 2022. As we carry out sales of receivables on a regular
basis both on a spot basis and under the Intesa Securitization Programs, as adjusted cash and cash equivalents includes
amounts received from such sales. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Accounts Receivables, Days Sales_
_Outstanding (“DSO”) and Amounts Overdue” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Revenue generation, cash_
_collection and billing patterns.” As adjusted cash and cash equivalents has been prepared for illustrative purposes only_
and does not represent what our actual cash position would have been had the Offering and the Bridge Facility Refinancing
occurred on December 31, 2022, nor does it purport to project our cash position at any future date. As a result, our cash
and cash equivalents as of the Issue Date or any future date may be higher or lower than the amount of cash and cash
equivalents as shown in the table above. For further information, see “Summary—Recent Developments—Recent Trading”
and “Capitalization.”

(11) As adjusted senior secured net debt represents indebtedness under the Notes, the Existing Notes, amounts outstanding

under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Term Loan less as adjusted cash and cash equivalents, in each
case, after giving effect to the Offering and the Bridge Facility Refinancing. See “Capitalization.”

(12) As adjusted net debt (excluding leases) represents our consolidated total indebtedness, as adjusted to give effect to the

Offering and the Bridge Facility Refinancing less as adjusted cash and cash equivalents. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Existing Company Indebtedness.” As adjusted net debt (excluding leases) is presented_
excluding, in each case as of December 31, 2022, (w) certain other financial liabilities of the Group that do not constitute
indebtedness in the amount of €226.5 million, primarily relating to (i) payables to our partners in respect of research and
development grants that we have collected on their behalf (€31.8 million), (ii) non-current liabilities for payables to factors
under our existing factoring agreements in respect of cash collected from customers on their behalf and other restricted
cash (€25.8 million) as well as, (x) lease liabilities under IFRS 16 of the Group in the amount of €168.9 million (including
€10.4 million of Be’s IFRS 16 liabilities). See also “Capitalization.”

(13) As adjusted net debt (including leases) represents our as adjusted net debt (excluding leases) plus €168.9 million of lease

obligations of the Group recognized under IFRS 16 as of December 31, 2022. See the immediately preceding footnote
and “Capitalization.”

(14) As adjusted cash interest expense (including leases) reflects the as adjusted interest expense of the Group for the year

ended December 31, 2022, as if the Notes had been issued on January 1, 2022 and the proceeds therefrom had been used
as set forth under “Use of Proceeds.” (therefore excluding any interest accrued under the Bridge Facility). This estimate
reflects the issuance of € million % Notes issued at par. As adjusted cash interest expense for the year ended
December 31, 2022 also includes interest on lease liabilities, which lease liabilities are in the amount of €168.9 million
as well as our interest expense in respect of the other existing Company indebtedness (which includes the Existing Notes
and the Existing Term Loan) for such period. See “Capitalization.” As adjusted cash interest expense for the year ended
December 31, 2022 excludes interest and commitment fees payable in respect of our Existing Revolving Credit Facility.
As adjusted cash interest expense is being presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what
our interest expense would have actually been had the issue of the Notes occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport
to project our interest expenses for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

(a) Be’s EBITDA is defined as the algebraic sum of profit for the period before taxes, earnings (including exchange rate

gains and losses), financial expense and non-monetary items, such as amortization/depreciation, write-downs and
allocations to provisions, even if classified under other items of the income statement. In addition, Be’s EBITDA for the
year ended December 31, 2022, has been further adjusted by €20.2 million representing certain extraordinary/nonrecurring costs incurred by Be in connection with the Be Acquisition, including (i) costs incurred as a result of the
acceleration of certain provisions under Be’s 2020-2022 incentive plan originally due in 2023, which resulted in the
implementation of retention and other incentives for certain key persons as well as other personnel costs (approximately

## RISK FACTORS

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors in the Notes should_
_carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this Offering_
_Memorandum before making a decision to invest in the Notes. Any of the following risks, individually_
_or together, could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects,_
_and accordingly the value of the Notes. This section describes the risks and uncertainties that we believe_
_are material, but these risks and uncertainties may not be the only ones that we face. Additional risks_
_and uncertainties, including those of which we are currently unaware or those which we deem_
_immaterial, may also result in decreased sales, assets and cash inflows, increased expenses, liabilities_
_or cash outflows or other events that could result in a decline in the value of the Notes, or which could_
_have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects._
_The order in which the risks are presented does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence_
_or the magnitude of their potential impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and_
_prospects or on the trading price of the Notes. Unless otherwise stated or the context suggests otherwise,_
_all references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Group” are to the Issuer and its subsidiaries, and include_
_the Be Group. However, unless otherwise specified, all historical financial and operating data for the_
_Group presented herein does not include the relevant data for the Be Group for periods prior to_
_September 26, 2022, the date of its consolidation into the Group’s results. Financial and operating data_
_for the year ended December 31, 2022 presented herein only includes Be Group’s data from September_
_26, 2022 until December 31, 2022._

_As a result of the correction of the accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and_
_Other Information—Accounting Errors” in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the inability of_
_the Issuer to allocate the effects of such errors to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2022,_
_the consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 extracted from_
_the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and contained in the following risk factors is not fully_
_comparable with (i) the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 derived_
_from the 2022 Audited Financial Statements, and (ii) the financial information as of and for the year_
_ended December 31, 2020 derived from the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements, in each case,_
_contained in the following risk factors. For the same reasons, the financial information as of and for_
_the year ended December 31, 2020 derived from the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements is also not_
_fully comparable with the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021_
_included in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the 2021 Financial Statements. In particular,_
_the financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 contained in the_
_following risk factors, including any related averages, ranges and growth rates, is impacted by the_
_accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting_
_Errors” and Note 1.1 to our 2022 Audited Financial Statements describing the correction of major_
_errors under IAS 8, and therefore you should not place undue reliance on such information. We have_
_marked any such financial information, including any related averages, ranges and growth rates, with_
_an asterisk (“*”) throughout the following risk factors. Neither the 2021 Financial Statements nor the_
_Company’s 2020 Financial Statements are included in the Offering Memorandum. See “—Risks Related_
_to Our Business and Industry—We identified certain accounting errors relating to 2022 and previous_
_fiscal years, which resulted in an overstatement of the Company’s consolidated balance sheet assets_
_and operating profits, and the independent report to the 2022 Audited Financial Statements included_
_in the Offering Memorandum includes an emphasis of matter paragraph in relation to such errors due_
_to our inability to allocate their effects to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2022. Investors_
_should therefore exercise caution when comparing our results of operations and balance sheet assets_
_among the periods under review in this Offering Memorandum, and in particular those relating to our_
_Finance industry vertical.”_

**Risks Related to Our Business and Industry**

**_The markets in which we operate are highly competitive._**

We operate in the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets, which represent our core
business and accounted for the vast majority of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. We
operate in Italy as well as in 20 countries worldwide including major European countries (such as
Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), the United States and Latin
American countries, such as Brazil. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and subject
to rapid change. We believe that the principal competitive factors in these markets are service quality,
technical and industry expertise, price, innovation, established relationships with key customers, often
on a local level, knowledge of the regulatory framework, rapidity in providing services requested by
the customers and the ability to add value to a customer’s business. We compete for business with a
variety of players, including large multinational firms and local players that provide consulting,
technology and/ or business process services, in-house captives of potential customers, software
services companies that also provide business process services and accounting firms that also provide
IT consulting services. In addition, the trend toward international expansion by IT services providers
and continued technological changes may result in new and different competitors entering our markets.
These competitors may include entrants from other industries, such as the communications, software
and data networking industries or entrants from geographical locations with lower labor and production
costs than in Italy. Our main competitors include Italian and European players, such as Reply, Almaviva
and Capgemini and large American and global multinational companies such as IBM, Accenture, DXC
Technology and NTT Data. In the consulting space, our competitors include BIP, Deloitte, KPMG and
Accenture.

Some of our competitors may benefit from greater economies of scale, have greater financial,
marketing, technological or other resources, larger customer bases and better-established reputations
and customer relationships in our markets than we do. As a result, some of these competitors may be
able to:

- more efficiently or more rapidly develop superior services or solutions, gain greater market
acceptance and expand their service offerings;

- more quickly adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements;

- bundle services with other services they provide at reduced prices;

- adopt more aggressive pricing policies, including in response to cost increases such as those
driven by the surging inflationary environment prevailing since the first quarter of 2022, which
may include lower price increases than those implemented by us in order to avoid customer
attrition, which may in turn limit our ability to increase prices or force us to have to lower prices
for certain products or services to remain competitive in the market;

- devote greater financial, marketing and other resources to the research and development of their
services and solutions, thereby increasing their competitive pressure; and

- better withstand adverse market conditions.

Increased competition may also result in lower prices and volumes, higher costs for resources,
especially personnel, and, as a result, lower profitability. As a result, we may not be able to supply
customers with services that they deem superior at competitive prices and may lose market share to our
competitors. Any inability to face increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects.

**_We may incur liabilities, be restricted from participating in public tenders, suffer reputational_**
**_damage or be prosecuted for the actions of our directors, employees, agents, representatives, advisors_**
**_and intermediaries who engage in illegal activities, including under LD 231/2001._**

Conducting our business in an ethically acceptable manner is important to our reputation, status with
regulators and business prospects. Any contact by our directors, employees, agents or partners with the
public administration (including in the context of participating in tenders, interactions with the public
administration in the process of obtaining or renewing any authorization or license and any possible
public contribution) involves risks associated with fraud, bribery, corruption, incorrect use of public
contributions, inappropriate contact with or influence of public officials in connection with tenders and
other fraudulent or illegal activities by our employees and the cost and management distraction of
related investigations.

In particular, we are subject to Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001 (“LD 231/2001”), which is aimed,
_inter alia, at preventing direct or indirect acts of corruption (including between private individuals),_
bribery, money laundering, anti-competitive behavior, fraud, environmental crimes and other illegal
conduct (all such offences, as specifically defined in LD 231/2001).

Pursuant to LD 231/2001, we may be held responsible for certain crimes committed in Italy or abroad
including, among others, bribery, money laundering, corruption (including among private individuals),
fraud against the state, corporate offenses, market abuse, certain environmental violations, tender
rigging and workplace safety violations in our interest or for our benefit, by individuals having a
functional relationship with us at the time the relevant crime was committed, including third party
agents, partners or intermediaries, unless we were able to prove that such individuals fraudulently
violated such internal control model and it was for us impossible to avoid such violation. In such
circumstances, we may be subject to fines, confiscation of profits or legal sanctions (applied as interim
measures during the investigations), including, subject to certain conditions being met, provisional
measures, the termination of authorization, permits, licenses, concessions and financing arrangements,
including facilitated financing, suspension of our operations, or prohibitions on contracting with public
authorities. The duration of these disqualifications generally ranges from a minimum of three months
to a maximum of two years, although in very serious cases, some of these disqualifications can be
applied permanently. As an alternative to disqualification and suspension of operations, the court may
appoint a judicial custodian to run the company, with the consequence that the profits gained during the
receivership period are automatically confiscated. In addition, pursuant to Article 80 of Italian
Legislative Decree 50/2016, as amended (the “Italian Procurement Code”) as well as pursuant to new
provisions having similar content included in the new Italian procurement code recently approved by
the Italian Parliament and which will become effective on July 1, 2023 and will apply to new tenders,
public contracting authorities can exclude contractors from tender procedures, among other things, in
case they can demonstrate that such contractor has committed serious professional misconduct (grave
_illecito professionale) in Italy or abroad, which include criminal, civil and administrative offences, as_
well as instances in which a contractor did not provide specific information required by the relevant
contracting authority for tenders. If we were found to have committed any such serious professional
misconduct and/or failed to disclose specific information required for tenders, including actions or
events that could be deemed to constitute serious professional misconduct by the relevant authorities,
we could be excluded from participating in the relevant tenders, either automatically or following the
authorities’ assessment, for up to three years from when the relevant misconduct took place. We may
also be subject to allegations from competitors that we have failed to disclose specific information
required for tenders.

We are also subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in
which we operate, including the Italian Royal Decree 1398/1930 and LD 231/2001 and potentially the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, which, among other things, prohibit
giving or offering to give anything of value (such as gifts, payments or any other benefits) with the
intent to influence any officer, employee, agent or advisor or with the intent to award governmental
contract. Violations of such laws or adverse findings in proceedings related thereto, could result in


-----

penalties ranging from exclusion from tenders, to fines (which may be significant) and to other civil,
administrative or criminal sanctions.

Between 2020 and 2022, the Company, together with eight other companies and ATM, the company
wholly owned by the municipality of Milan (Comune di Milano) that manages the Milan metro system,
were subject to an investigation undertaken by authorities in Italy involving allegations that certain
public tenders involving ATM were impacted by improper benefits provided by employees of the
companies under investigation, including seven employees of the Company, including the head of the
Company’s transportation business sub-segment. In connection with the investigation, four of the
Company’s employees subject to the investigation were initially placed under house arrests and were
subsequently released following the pretrial hearings for the gathering of evidence before the beginning
of the criminal proceeding (incidente probatorio) that was held on November 4, 2020. In relation to
such events, the relevant authorities also investigated the Company as well as the other companies for
alleged violations of LD 231/2001, the Italian law on corporate liability for crimes, and in particular
corruption. In December 2021, the prosecutors announced the completion of the preliminary
investigation. On June 23, 2022, the prosecutors issued a request of indictment (rinvio a giudizio)
against certain employees subject to the investigation and separated the proceeding related to the
Company from the proceeding relating such employees pursuant to a separation decision
(provvedimento di stralcio). On November 9, 2022, the general public prosecutor endorsed the public
prosecutor’s decree to dismiss any case against the Company, thus confirming the dismissal of the
Company’s position. As a result, the Company is no longer involved in this criminal proceeding. The
negative effects of the investigation on the Company’s business and operations were limited. However,
on July 9, 2020, ATM terminated its two existing contracts with the Company and one existing contract
with its subsidiary, Engineering 365, which we estimate collectively accounted for approximately €0.7
million of revenues over the last three years. The Company has initiated legal proceedings challenging
the termination of such contracts by ATM claiming, among other things, that (i) ATM failed to carry
out the required evaluation or analysis confirming the Company’s alleged failure to carry out its
contractual obligations, (ii) the termination clause used by ATM to terminate the existing contracts was
not valid, (iii) the conduct of the Company’s employees subject to the ongoing investigation was not
the responsibility of the Company and (iv) ATM failed to take into account the self-cleansing actions
undertaken by the Company as well as the lack of a final judgment against the Company in this
investigation. In May 2022, ATM and the Company reached a final settlement in relation to such
proceedings, providing for the mutual dismissal of their respective claims.

Although we believe that we have adequate policies (including both the management and organizational
model we adopted pursuant LD 231/2001, which is aimed at preventing offences specifically identified
therein and the ISO 370001 anti-bribery management system) and enforcement mechanisms to ensure
legal and regulatory compliance with these and other similar laws and regulations, we cannot rule out
that some of our employees, subcontractors, agents or partners may violate any such legal and regulatory
requirements, which may expose us to criminal or civil investigations and enforcement actions,
including penalties and suspension or disqualification from procurement contracting. If we fail to
comply with legal and regulatory requirements, our business and reputation may be harmed. The
involvement or association of our directors, employees or agents in any fraud, bribery or corruption and
other crimes committed in relation to our activities or otherwise, or allegations or rumors relating
thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations or negatively affect our reputation. The materialization of any of the foregoing risks could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_We may suffer legal civil or criminal sanctions if we are found to have violated IT-related laws or_**
**_rights or committed tortious acts related to IT._**

We are also exposed to the risk that our directors, employees or agents commit IT related crimes, which
may consist of using our infrastructure to violate the IT systems of our competitors, unlawful access to
banking data (including that of our customers) and damage the IT systems and documents. In addition,
we may be subject to claims in connection with accounting fraud, damage to property, business


-----

interruptions, unauthorized use of our property, unauthorized entry or breach of security protocols,
negligence, willful misconduct or other tortious acts by our employees or people who have gained
unauthorized access to premises operated by us through us. Such claims may be substantial and may
result in adverse publicity for us. Our business activities may also involve risks related to possible
accidents, which may be due to our employees’ activities or mistakes and may consist in crimes,
breaches of security measures, damages to third parties or manslaughter. The materialization of any of
the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

**_We identified certain accounting errors relating to 2022 and previous fiscal years, which resulted in_**
**_an overstatement of the Company’s consolidated balance sheet assets and operating profits, and the_**
**_independent report to the 2022 Audited Financial Statements included in the Offering Memorandum_**
**_includes an emphasis of matter paragraph in relation to such errors due to our inability to allocate_**
**_their effects to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2022. Investors should therefore exercise_**
**_caution when comparing our results of operations and balance sheet assets among the periods under_**
**_review in this Offering Memorandum, and in particular those relating to our Finance industry_**
**_vertical._**

In September 2022, we became aware of certain discrepancies between budgeted and final financial
data as of August 2022 relating to the Company’s Finance industry vertical and its subsidiary Nexen
(which is part of the Finance industry vertical). As a result of such discrepancies, we initiated a process,
with the assistance from external advisors, in order to verify the accounting methods used for specific
jobs within the Company’s Finance industry vertical and Nexen.

This verification process, which was completed at the end of the fiscal year 2022, identified certain
accounting errors relating to the 2022 and previous fiscal years, which resulted in an overstatement of
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet assets and operating profits. On this basis, management
determined that it was necessary to make certain corrections to the financial statements and applied IAS
8 (Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors), which governs, among other
things, how to recognise and represent errors, including those from previous years.

The verification process concluded that the accounting errors resulted from the allocation of costs in
our internal management system, which mainly led to the recognition of revenues:

(iii) relating to jobs that were not supported by any underlying contract, including by allocating to

such jobs costs that were unrelated to them (e.g., costs relating to other existing jobs), and by
recognizing corresponding revenues on our accounting systems; and

(iv) in advance of their accrual period.

As a result of such errors, the Company recorded non-recoverable balance sheet assets in the form of
invoices to be issued and work-in-progress (recognized in the financial statements under current assets
in the item “Customer contract assets”), which could not be and were not invoiced to customers.

Based on the results of the verification process, we quantified the following accounting effects:

(iii) an overstatement of the Group’s operating profit and EBITDA for the year ended December

31, 2022, of €10.9 million; and

(iv) an overstatement of the balance sheet assets as of January 1, 2022 of €46.0 million.

Both effects were corrected in our 2022 Audited Financial Statements.

While it was possible to allocate the effects of the accounting errors that occurred during 2022 to the
financial year ended December 31, 2022 due to the availability of current information on the progress


-----

of the Finance industry vertical’s contracts, we were not able to allocate with certainty the €46.0 million
overstatement of balance sheet assets as of January 1, 2022 to any prior periods because of the way our
management systems close out jobs and of the lack of traceability inside the system for such an
accounting error. As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, these accounting errors did not result in
a material impact on the relationship with our customers.

With respect to these accounting errors relating to fiscal years prior to 2022, we applied paragraphs 42
to 47 of IAS 8 as it was not possible to accurately and reasonably determine the impact of such errors
on such fiscal years. The Company therefore concluded that it was appropriate to adjust the opening
balance of assets and shareholders’ equity as of January 1, 2022, in order to reflect the lower value of
the assets of €46.0 million, by setting up a specific adjustment provision with the opening shareholders’
equity as of January 1, 2022, as a balancing entry.

As a result of these events, the independent auditors’ report for the consolidated financial statements of
the Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 included in this Offering Memorandum,
includes an emphasis of matter paragraph in relation to the inability of the Issuer to allocate the effects
of certain accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—
_Accounting Errors” to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2022. See also Note 1.1 to our_
2022 Audited Financial Statements describing the correction of major errors under IAS 8.

With respect to the accounting treatment of the correction of errors relating to fiscal year 2022, these
were corrected prior to the approval of the 2022 Audited Financial Statements, as required by IAS 8
(par. 5), according to which “potential errors of the current financial year discovered in the same
_financial year shall be corrected before the publication of the financial statements is authorised.”_
Therefore, we corrected the relevant items in the income statement for the year ended December 31,
2022, generating a corresponding impact on the operating profit and EBITDA, which was rectified by
€10.9 million.

These accounting errors were the result of intentional misconduct by certain members of the
management of our Finance industry vertical. As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, such
members of management of the Finance industry vertical are being or have been replaced.

Following completion of the verification process carried out with respect to the Finance industry
vertical, we deemed it prudent to carry out further verification processes on all the other verticals of the
Company with the assistance of external advisors whose work was completed by the end of 2022. As
of the date of this Offering Memorandum, no incorrect accounting practices similar to those uncovered
in the Company’s Finance vertical and Nexen were identified. However, as a result of such verification
process, we prudentially made specific provisions of approximately €7.0 million (of which €6.1 million
relating to contract work in progress and €0.9 million to invoices to be issued) in our balance sheet as
of December 31, 2022, in respect of some positions relating to assets accrued mainly in previous years
and not invoiced, exclusively attributable to technical/commercial issues that emerged during the
execution of the jobs. Such €7.0 million provisions did not impact our consolidated EBITDA for the
year ended December 31, 2022.

As a result of the correction of the accounting errors in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements as
summarized above and the inability of the Issuer to quantify the above-mentioned corrections on net
income and shareholders’ equity for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the consolidated
financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 contained in the 2022 Audited
Financial Statements included in the Offering Memorandum is not fully comparable with (i) the
financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the 2022 Audited
Financial Statements and the 2021 Financial Statements, and (ii) the financial information as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2020 derived from the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements. Neither the
2021 Financial Statements nor the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements are included in the Offering
Memorandum. For the same reasons, the financial information as of and for the year ended December
31, 2020 derived from the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements is also not fully comparable with the


-----

financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the 2022 Audited
Financial Statements and the 2021 Financial Statements.

This Offering Memorandum also includes certain financial information as of and for the two months
ended February 28, 2022 under “Summary—Recent Trading,” which is compared to corresponding
financial information as of and for the two months ended February 28, 2023. Such information as of
and for the two months ended February 28, 2022 was impacted by the accounting error described above
due to our inability to allocate the impact of the accounting error on the 2022 Audited Financial
Statements on a quarter or monthly basis through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. As a result,
the financial information as of and for the two months ended February 28, 2022 presented herein is not
fully comparable with the financial information as of and for the two months ended February 28, 2023
(which was not impacted by the accounting error), and therefore you should not place undue reliance
on such information.

As a consequence of the foregoing, throughout this Offering Memorandum, we have either marked any
such financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, including any
related averages, ranges and growth rates, with an asterisk (“*”) or we have included appropriate
footnotes to the relevant financial tables as a reminder that each such financial information may be
affected by accounting errors. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing our results
of operations and balance sheet assets among the periods under review in this Offering Memorandum,
and in particular those relating to our Finance industry vertical.

We have implemented what we believe to be adequate changes to reinforce our internal control systems
as well as oversight mechanisms to prevent the occurrence of similar accounting errors and we will
continue to strengthen them. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, no other incorrect accounting
practices similar to those uncovered in the Company’s Finance industry vertical and Nexen were
identified. In addition, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Company is not aware of any
investigations and/or proceedings of any nature initiated by public authorities in relation to the
accounting errors. If new accounting errors are identified in the future, our business and reputation may
be further harmed. The involvement or association of our employees in the intentional implementation
of similar conducts, or allegations or rumors relating thereto, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations or negatively affect our reputation. The
materialization of any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_Certain line items contained in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the 2021 Financial_**
**_Statements are not comparable to the corresponding line items included in the Company’s 2020_**
**_Financial Statements._**

Given the different scope of consolidation, the financial results of the Company and the Issuer are not
directly comparable. In particular, certain line items contained in the consolidated income statement
and balance sheet included in the 2021 Financial Statements (including the comparative financial data
for the period between March 20, 2020 (the date of incorporation of the Issuer) and December 31, 2020)
are not comparable to the corresponding line items contained in the Company’s 2020 Financial
Statements. In particular, the different scope of consolidation results with respect to the financial
information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in the 2021 Financial Statements
also including, among others, indebtedness and cash at the level of the Issuer (including indebtedness
under the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan, and associated interest payments), which are not
otherwise included in the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements.

In addition, we have accounted for the Engineering Acquisition using the acquisition method of
accounting under IFRS and applied purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the
Engineering Acquisition to the financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the
Engineering Acquisition Closing Date. However, the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements have not
been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statement, statement of


-----

financial position or cash flow statement that occurred as a result of purchase accounting adjustments
applied to the Engineering Acquisition. The most material differences between the financial information
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the 2021 Financial Statements as compared
to the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements relate to amortization and depreciation, financial expenses
and income taxes. For example, amortization and depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2021
included in the 2021 Financial Statements was higher by €35.7* million compared to the Company’s
2020 Financial Statements. This is mainly due to incremental amortization charges of customer lists
and customer relationships recognized by the Issuer following completion of the Engineering
Acquisition. Financial expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the Issuer’s
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 was higher by €55.9*
million compared to the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements. This is mainly due to payment of €24.1
million in interest on the Existing Funding Loan and €37.8 million in interest payments by the Issuer
on the Existing Notes. Income taxes recorded in the audited consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2021 were higher by €94.3* million compared to the Company’s
2020 Financial Statements. This is mainly due to the extraordinary release to the income statement for
the year ended December 31, 2020, of deferred tax liabilities relating to trademarks and other intangible
assets over the same period. Similar differences exist, _mutatis mutandis, with respect to the audited_
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 included in the 2022
Audited Financial Statements. As a result of the differences described above, the audited consolidated
financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 Audited Financial

In addition, as a result of the correction of the accounting errors described under “Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors” in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and_
Note 1.1 to our 2022 Audited Financial Statements describing the correction of major errors under IAS
8, as well as the inability of the Issuer to allocate the effects of such errors to periods prior to the year
ended December 31, 2022, the consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended December
31, 2022 contained in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements included in the Offering Memorandum is
not fully comparable with (i) the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021
included in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the 2021 Financial Statements, and (ii) the
financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 derived from the Company’s
2020 Financial Statements. For the same reasons, the financial information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020 derived from the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements is also not fully comparable
with the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the 2022
Audited Financial Statements and the 2021 Financial Statements. Investors should therefore exercise
caution when comparing our results of operations and balance sheet assets among the periods under
review in this Offering Memorandum. See “—We identified certain accounting errors relating to 2022

**_If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report_**
**_our financial results or prevent fraud._**

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, avoid accounting
errors, and effectively prevent fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud


-----

could harm our business, including through harm to our reputation. This risk is increased as a result of
our frequent acquisitions. In particular, in recent years, we have been expanding the size and scope of
our operations, including most recently with the acquisition of the Be Group, and we intend to continue
such growth in the future. As we expand the size and scope of our Group, including internationally,
there is an increased risk that our internal controls may not mature at the same pace. Certain entities
that we acquired in the past did not have internal control procedures of an effectiveness equivalent to
ours. Furthermore, maintenance of internal controls may become more difficult, burdensome and/or
expensive as certain of the entities we have acquired or may acquire may prepare their financial
statements in accordance with local accounting rules rather than IFRS. As we grow, the required
sophistication of our internal controls and accounting and financial reporting functions will also need
to expand to ensure our internal controls remain adequate. Moreover, complex accounting standards
and interpretations, such as IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, the amendments to IFRS 2 and IFRIC 23,
have created new and more demanding requirements for financial reporting and disclosures, which
require further development of our internal controls. If we fail to maintain, or fail to cause the companies
we acquire to adopt and maintain, adequate internal controls our financial statements may be affected
by accounting errors or other inaccuracies, and more generally may not accurately reflect our financial
condition and results of operations. See also “—We identified certain accounting errors relating to 2022

**_Our business may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, political events and_**
**_geopolitical conflicts, including political and economic uncertainty in Italy and Europe._**

Our business may be negatively affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, such as
general macroeconomic conditions, volatility in the global capital and credit markets, including in the
European sovereign debt market, geopolitical events and other general political and economic
developments globally and in the markets in which we operate, particularly in Italy and other member
states of the European Union. Despite an improvement in global economic conditions in 2021 and 2022
following the sharp global economic downturn in 2020 resulting from the first waves of the COVID-19
pandemic, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum the outlook for the global economy remains
highly uncertain, and certain markets, including Italy, may not achieve the growth rates that they have
forecasted or historically observed. Such uncertainty has been recently exacerbated by the global
turmoil resulting from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has resulted in severe
political, social and economic consequences in the countries directly involved in the conflict as well as
more broadly on the European continent, as tensions between Russia, the European Union, the United
States, the United Kingdom and other countries continue to increase and certain governments (including
Italy’s) collapsed. Among other things, the ongoing war in Ukraine has been a driver behind a
significant surge in energy and transportation prices in 2022, which have been, and may continue to be,
a key factor in driving inflationary pressure and may ultimately adversely affect general economic
conditions as well as our results of operations. For example, our utilities costs and transportation costs
increased from €3.4 million and €2.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021 to
€6.6 million and €3.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The ongoing conflict
in Ukraine has also heightened risks of cyberattacks perpetrated by government and other actors and
may also result in slowdowns or halts in the production of electronic and other critical components for
our business. In addition, in response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine, the United States, the European
Union, the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions have implemented a broad suite of sanctions on
certain Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian economic sectors, entities and persons, have imposed
restrictions on exports of various products and services to and/or from such countries, including
financial services, and may impose increasingly stringent sanctions going forward. While we do not
serve customers or generate revenues in Russia or Belarus, following the completion of the Be


-----

Acquisition we own one of Be’s subsidiaries, which is incorporated and currently operates in Ukraine,
primarily serving customers in such country, with a yearly turnover of less than 1% of our total annual
turnover for 2022, as if the Be Group had been fully consolidated into our results on January 1, 2022.
As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, our operations continue uninterrupted in Ukraine and there
have been no interruptions in payment flows. Historically, the amount of revenues generated in Russia
was immaterial. While we continue to monitor the evolving geopolitical situation, including in respect
of compliance with applicable sanctions, we may not be able to operate and generate future sales in
Ukraine due to, among others, the implementation of further financial and economic sanctions. A
renewed or future economic recession, energy and logistics issues, further political and economic
instability and escalating geopolitical tensions in Europe or globally as a result of any of the foregoing
factors could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our solutions, our business and our
results of operations.

In addition, our revenues are derived in the vast majority from customers located in Italy. In the years
ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, revenues generated from customers in Italy accounted for
86%*, 88%* and 82% of our total revenues, respectively. In addition, in the years ended December 31,
2020, 2021 and 2022, revenues generated from customers in Italy accounted for approximately 63%,
56% and 48.7% of Be’s total revenues, respectively. As a result, macroeconomic conditions, market
trends and customer demand in Italy have a significant impact our results of operations. A downturn in
the Italian economy, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing military
confrontation between Russia and Ukraine and any potential extension thereof, or a protracted
inflationary spike, could negatively affect the labor market, creditworthiness of certain of our customers
and other counterparties, which, among other things, may lead our customers to delay the payments for
our services or postpone their IT projects with us. A declining or stagnating gross domestic product,
increasing or stagnating unemployment rates, and generally unfavorable conditions in the Italian
financial markets may also result in a reduction in customer spending or in demand for our services,
which could negatively impact our results of operations. Additionally, any prolonged political
instability in Italy may make conducting our business more challenging. Following the resignation of
Prime Minister Mr. Draghi in July 2022, early general elections took place in September 2022 and a
new a center-right coalition government was appointed on the back of a parliamentary majority.
However, as future political events are difficult to predict, there can be no assurance on the duration in
office of the new government or that there may not be further political instability, including snap
elections, or politically-motivated protests, strikes or violence, which may result in possible material
adverse effects on the Italian economy and our business, especially in relation to the PNRR. In addition,
the new government may take positions that further exacerbate economic uncertainty in Italy which, in
turn, may give rise to a decrease in prices and profitability levels and have other material impacts on
the ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets. For example, should the new Italian government
decide to decrease, delay, suspend and/or discontinue any programs aimed at encouraging IT spend,
including the “Impresa 4.0” digitalization plan as well as any other IT-related projects to be financed
through the European Commission’s recovery and resiliency funds granted to Italy, any such decision
could reduce our customers’ IT spend, which in turn may give rise to a decrease in prices for our
products and reduce our profitability. Moreover, other macroeconomic or ratings events affecting Italy
could also have a negative impact on our business, and be exacerbated by increasing political instability.
In November 2022, Fitch Ratings affirmed Italy’s sovereign credit rating at BBB while indicating a
stable outlook. Since May 2021, Moody’s Investors Service has not changed Italy’s sovereign credit
rating, which remains at Baa3, while in August 2022 it changed Italy’s rating outlook from stable to
negative. In April 2023, S&P Global Ratings confirmed Italy’s sovereign credit rating at BBB while
indicating a stable outlook.

In addition, the material increases in global inflation since early 2022, reaching double-digit levels not
seen since the 1980s, and expectations that annual inflation may remain high for a long period of time
(driven at least in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting impact on energy markets) has
forced central banks of the major world economies, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the
European Central Bank, to significantly increase market interest rates in a very short timeframe, ending
the lengthy period of low interest rates. As global inflation levels and interest rates continue to remain


-----

high, economic growth may be negatively impacted, which in turn may adversely affect our business,
operations and financial performance. These factors have also led to a collapse in consumer and
business confidence that is negatively impacting the post-pandemic recovery. It is possible that higher
prices will push the industrial sector and the EU economy into a recession over the short to medium
term. These conditions also materially increase the risk of a stagflation scenario taking hold. Partly as
a result of the ongoing interest rate surge, in March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, one of the largest U.S.
banks in the technology sector, collapsed, representing the largest global bank failure since the 2008
financial crisis and requiring immediate government intervention. This collapse caused challenges for
several U.S. regional banks and was shortly followed by the shutdown by U.S. regulators of a smaller
U.S.-based bank, Signature Bank, and the downfall in Credit Suisse’s share price, which was followed,
in turn, by the announced merger brokered by Swiss authorities between Credit Suisse and UBS. The
pressure on U.S. regional banks has continued, leading to the announcement by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation on May 1, 2023, that First Republic Bank, a California based regional bank,
would be taken over by JPMorgan Chase. While the situation continues to develop and the industrywide impact of these events is not yet clear, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, it is not
possible to predict the impact that these events may have on the U.S. and global banking and financial
systems and monetary policy, and any potential associated effect on the Italian economy, the economies
of the other countries where we operate and, in turn, on our customers operating in the financial sector.
In the event of failure or financial distress of any of our lenders or financial counterparties, we may be
unable to access deposits or undrawn amounts under our facilities in a timely fashion or at all, which
could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to fund our ongoing working capital needs
and general corporate purposes. Similarly, if any of our customers were unable to access their funds
with their lenders or financial counterparties, their ability to pay their obligations to us or to enter into
new arrangements requiring additional payments to us could be materially adversely affected. In
addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less
favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and
operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, which could make
it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available
funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our
ability to meet our operating expenses, financial obligations or fulfill our other obligations or result in
breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations.

Any of the foregoing events, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects as well as our ability to perform
our obligations under the Notes.

**_If we are unable to anticipate and develop new services and products, enhance existing services and_**
**_products and keep pace with rapid changes in the technology services and products industries, our_**
**_business could be materially and adversely affected._**

The ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets are characterized by rapid technological changes,
evolving industry standards, increasing regulatory impact, changing customer preferences and the
constant development and introduction of new products and services. Areas of significant change
include mobility, cloud-based computing, AI, digitalization and the processing and analysis of large
and unstructured data (so-called big data analytics). Our future success will depend on our ability to
anticipate these advances and trends and develop tailored new product and service offerings to meet our
customers’ evolving needs. If we fail to anticipate or respond to these advances and trends on a timely
basis, or if we fail to develop services or technologies that fail to meet our customers’ needs or gain
traction in the marketplace, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may
be materially and adversely affected. In addition, while we strive to maintain strong technological
capabilities to remain at the forefront of our industry, the process of developing new, high technology
products and services and improving existing products and services is complex and uncertain. Any
failure to identify, anticipate and keep pace with the changing needs of our customers and emerging
technological trends, as well as to introduce attractive and more innovative products and services, could


-----

lead to a decline in the use of our solutions, which could in turn significantly damage our market share
and results of operations.

We invest in R&D and innovation to support the ongoing improvement of our organization, increase
our competitive capacity and fulfill the needs of a fluid, rapidly changing market. There is no guarantee
that our R&D efforts will be successful and result in significant design or performance improvements
or marketable products or features. Even if successful, such efforts may require us to incur substantial
costs and may result in products and services that are more expensive than anticipated, as a result of
which we may lose all or a portion of our investment. If we are unable to successfully anticipate
technological developments, we may be forced to implement these new technologies at a substantial
cost in order to match technological developments by our competitors. Any such failure to anticipate
market trends and customer preferences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Some of the industries in which our customers operate are subject to extensive governmental_**
**_regulation, and changes in these regulations, or the failure by us or any of our third-party suppliers_**
**_to comply with these regulations, could harm our business._**

Some of the industries in which our customers operate, including the finance, banking, healthcare and
telecommunications industries, are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving laws and
regulations. These regulations govern, among other things, the provisions of some of our services as
well as the development of some of our products, including our Proprietary Solutions, in particular
software solutions, and their utilization by our customers. In addition, in providing software, digital
solutions and IT services to our customers, we often process, collect and store sensitive personal data
of customers, business partners, employees, third parties and others (including, among others, name,
address, age, and bank details) as part of the ordinary course of our business operations. We are
therefore subject to data protection and privacy legislation, including the EU General Data Protection
Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) and the Italian Privacy Code (Legislative Decree No. 196/2003, as
amended by Legislative Decree No. 101/2018, which adapted applicable Italian rules to GDPR). Such
laws and regulations restrict our ability to collect, process and use personal data relating to customers,
potential customers, business partners, and employees, including for marketing purposes.

In particular, the GDPR increased both the number and the restrictive nature of the obligations
applicable to us, with a focus on the collection, processing, use and transfer of personal data. The GDPR
obligates European Union-based companies or companies that process personal data about European
Union subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a large number of
obligations, which relate, for example, to (i) the processing of personal data including transparency,
data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security and confidentiality, (ii) the ability of the
controller to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability), (iii) the obligation to
identify a legal basis before the processing and (iv) the rights of data subjects, such as, among others,
transparency, a right of access, the right to rectification and the right to erasure. The GDPR obligates
companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy
implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies or types of data.
Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in significant penalties including fines of up to 4% of total
annual worldwide turnover or €20 million (whichever is higher), depending on the type and severity of
the breach. The fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures that may be ordered by
supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease processing). Our data security insurance coverage
is limited and we cannot guarantee that our data security insurance coverage or our general liability
insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all or any liabilities in the event of a breach of our data
security systems. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any applicable data protection
laws and regulations could result in proceedings, investigations or other actions (including class actions)
brought against us by governmental entities and agencies or private individuals and entities, which may
result in significant fines, penalties, judgments and reputational damages to our business, and require
us to change business practices and increase the costs and complexity of compliance, any of which
could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover,


-----

evolving regulation relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs
and affect or limit the way through which we collect, process, use, store and transfer personal data.
Compliance with, and monitoring of such laws and regulations is demanding, time consuming and
costly. Further, such laws and regulations, including their interpretation and application, change from
time to time, and such changes could impose new burdens and expose us to further liability, either of
which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and
financial condition. Furthermore, in the aftermath of various personnel initiatives that we have been
implementing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as an increasing reliance on remote working,
as well as an increased amount of employee health data being processed, our exposure to this risk has
been heightened.

Any changes in these laws and regulations or procedural rules, such as those governing public
procurement and tender processes, could reduce the profitability of our products and, in exceptional
circumstances, could render the market introduction of a new product unprofitable. Any failure to
comply with the applicable regulations, including by third-party licensees, partners and customers,
could result in fines, enforcement actions by governments or competent authorities, injunctions or other
measures which could result in reputational harm, reduced sales and market share and, in turn, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For
example, in the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, revenues from our Telco &
Media industry declined due to the significant reduction in volumes generated on Mobile VAS, a
platform enabling mobile operators to sell value-added products and services to customers with
subscriptions, resulting from restrictions imposed by the competent Italian authorities on the use of
services through the _Mobile VAS platform by such mobile operators. In addition, new requirements_
were introduced over the same period by the competent Italian authorities for operators to implement
new control and safety measures in connection with their customer acquisition processes, which
requirements drove a 80% decrease of revenues from our sales of customer acquisition processes
solutions to customers in the Telco & Media industry vertical in 2020 compared to 2019. Such reduction
in revenue has also continued in subsequent periods and while we recorded revenues of €1.5* million
from Mobile VAS solutions in the year ended December 31, 2021, these declined to approximately €0.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result, revenues generated from Mobile VAS are
no longer material. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Sales Mix across_
_Activities and Industry Verticals—Sales Mix across Industry Verticals.”_

**_We face risks related to the services we provide to government and other public entities._**

In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 22% of our revenue through our Public
Administration industry vertical, which primarily includes the sale of products and services to
municipal, local and regional governmental and other public and semi-public entities in Italy. Over the
same period the Be Group generated approximately 1.5% of its revenue through public administration
customers. Projects involving governments or governmental agencies carry various risks inherent in the
government contracting process, including the following:

- government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects
are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the
right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at
their convenience.

- changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or
uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our
projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our
recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the
termination;


-----

- terms and conditions of contracts with public sector entities tend to be more onerous than other
contracts and may include, among other things, extensive rights of audit, more punitive servicelevel penalties and other restrictive covenants;

- contractual non-compliance (including improper billing), failure to comply with procurement
regulations and regulation regarding the protection of classified information, and other
improper or illegal activities, may result in various civil and criminal penalties and
administrative sanctions, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the
government, in addition to other typical remedies for breach of contract, which may include
termination of the relevant contracts, forfeiture of profits and suspension of payments.
Moreover, according to general principles of Italian law on contracting with public entities,
bans from contracting with public agencies/bodies as well as termination of existing contracts
with them may also result from the relevant authorities determining, on a case by case basis (in
compliance with Italian law and within the limits set forth therein), that the relevant company
no longer ensures an adequate level of reliability, as a consequence of the impairment of the
general fiduciary relationship between such company and the relevant public entities;

- government contracts are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other
contracts. Any negative publicity related to such contracts, regardless of the accuracy of such
publicity, may adversely affect our business and reputation;

- participation in government contracts could subject us to stricter regulatory requirements,
which may increase our cost of compliance;

- political and economic factors, such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections,
changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision-makers, revisions to
governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues, can affect the number and terms
of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease
future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid for, shift spending
priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in
enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed;

- government contracts may involve multiple parties in the delivery of services and require
greater project management efforts on our part, and any failure in this regard may adversely
impact our performance and reputation;

- litigation or disputes with government and public entities may lead to us being banned from
contracting with other government and public entities or participating in public tenders, which
would have both an economic and a reputational impact on us; and

- public sector-related customers sometimes follow payment management processes that are
subject to review by other government authorities or other entities, which may cause delays or
adjustments to their own payment schedule. This dynamic creates seasonality in our cash flows,
which could give rise to liquidity problems during the periods when collection associated with
projects are structurally lower.

If one or more of the foregoing risks were to materialize, they could have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and
prospects.

**_Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our_**
**_business and results of operations._**

Significant outbreaks of contagious diseases, including the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic or
other illnesses, may result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and
financial markets of many countries, leading to substantial declines in consumer purchasing power and


-----

resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products, our ability to collect
against existing trade receivables and our operating results. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the measures
implemented by national governments and other authorities to contain or mitigate its effects, including
lockdowns, travel restrictions, mandatory quarantines, the imposition of remote working and, in some
countries including Italy, restrictions on the access to facilities and office buildings, have severely
restricted the level of economic activity globally and have impacted our operations and may continue
to do so in the future.

Since the first outbreak in 2020, the virus has mutated multiple times from its original form and several
different COVID-19 variants have originated, some of which have a much higher infection rate
compared to the original form. Resurgences or further outbreaks of COVID-19, including as a result of
further mutations of the virus, are likely to occur; however, their nature, extent and duration are highly
uncertain and beyond our control. There can be no assurance that COVID-19 or any future outbreak of
another virus or other contagious disease will not have a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations. In particular, new waves of infection, together with renewed or extended lockdown and other restrictive measures implemented in response thereto, if materialized, may cause further
disruption in our business operations, cause delay, or limit the ability of, municipal customers and other
customers to perform under their existing contracts, including making timely payments to us, and cause
other unpredictable events. In addition, our customers may experience significant losses and may
terminate their existing contracts or postpone or ultimately cancel future planned orders and contracts
due to those losses. Both domestic and international travel may be further restricted to certain areas
which may limit our ability to obtain new customers and enter new markets, to provide services in the
areas in which our customers are currently located or otherwise conduct our operations as we would do
under normal circumstances.

To the extent our activities are disrupted by restrictions imposed by governments or other authorities to
address resurgences or further outbreaks of COVID-19 or any other infectious disease, or by changes
in customer behavior, this may result in a loss of customers, and our future rate of growth may slow
compared to the past. The general economic impacts of such restrictions on the communities that we
serve may result in customers not being able to continue to pay for our IT software, services and
solutions or deciding to postpone, cancel or reduce their investment in IT software, services and
solutions. This could result in an increase in bad debts and cancellations, as well as in a reduction or
delay in revenue collection, which could impact our liquidity, cash flow, profitability and attrition rate
negatively. Any further disruption triggered by COVID-19 as well as any other infectious disease in
countries where our suppliers and customers are located, such as Italy, may result in a slow-down of
their production activities and other disruptions, any of which could have a material impact on our
business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic as well as any other infectious disease negatively affects
our business, results of operations and financial condition depends on several factors, such as the
duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of any additional periods of
lockdown and other restrictive measures in Italy and/or the countries in which our customers are located,
and the pace at which demand, pricing and, in general, economic and operating conditions will stabilize
and recover in the countries where we operate, including Italy. Any future developments are highly
uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken
by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.

To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operation, financial
condition and prospects, as well as our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes, it may also
have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.

**_Any delay or failure in payment for our services by customers who represent a large percentage of_**
**_our accounts receivable balance could adversely affect our business. Additionally, an increase in our_**
**_accounts receivable and in our provisions for bad debt, may negatively affect our working capital_**
**_and lead us to experience liquidity constraints._**


-----

From time to time, we carry significant accounts receivable balances from customers that generate a
large portion of our revenues. While we closely monitor timely payment of our accounts receivable, a
customer may become unable or unwilling to pay its balance on time due to, among other reasons, an
economic weakness in its industry or the financial insolvency of its business. In the year ended
December 31, 2022, our average days sales outstanding (DSOs) in trade receivables, excluding the
effect of non-recourse sales of receivables (both on a spot-basis and under the Intesa Securitization
Programs), was approximately 195 days. Any increase in our DSOs due to delays in payments could
negatively impact our liquidity. In addition, we account for possible write-downs of our accounts
receivable from customers through the creation of a bad debt provision. As of December 31, 2020, 2021
and 2022, the amount we allocated to allowance for bad debt with respect to receivables from customers
were €54.7* million, €57.0 million and €81.2 million, respectively. These amounts primarily relate to
unpaid invoices by Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. See “Business—Legal Proceedings” and “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Net Working Capital.” If_
our provisions for bad debt increase significantly, including as a result of the impact of the current
inflationary surge, this may have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows.

Historically, we have engaged in spot sale of trade receivables on a non-recourse basis to manage our
working capital in peak periods. In March 2022, we entered into the First Intesa Securitization Program,
consisting of a new committed framework factoring agreement with a vehicle controlled by Intesa
Sanpaolo S.p.A. providing for non-recourse sales of receivables for an aggregate amount of up to €150.0
million at any time outstanding. The First Intesa Securitization Program is subject to early withdrawal
and termination rights which are triggered, inter alia, in the event of default in the timely payment by
the Group under certain other indebtedness, or a change of control of the Issuer, EDH and, following
consummation of the Engineering Merger, MergerCo, in accordance with the provisions set forth in the
Existing Indenture. As of December 31, 2022, €110.7 million were outstanding under the First Intesa
Securitization Program, while €39.3 million were available for drawing. In addition, in October 2021
we entered into the Second Intesa Securitization Program, which provides for the non-recourse sales of
receivables from Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold €122.6 million
trade receivables under the Second Intesa Securitization Program. See “Description of Certain Other
_Financing Arrangements—Existing Company Indebtedness—Intesa Securitization Programs.” As a_
result of sales of receivables under the Intesa Securitization Programs and other spot sales of
receivables, as of December 31, 2022, as part of our receivables management strategy and to support
our M&A activity we sold €787.8 million of trade receivables on a non-recourse basis, €133.3 million
of which were still outstanding at period end (excluding €121.2 million of trade receivables sold on a
non-recourse basis by Be, €39.6 million of which were still outstanding as of December 31, 2022).

As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, we rely primarily on our operating cash flow and on sales
of receivables under our Intesa Securitization Programs and on a spot basis, as well as our Existing
Revolving Credit Facility to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity needs. There can be no
assurance that our operating cash flow and sales of receivables under our Intesa Securitization Programs
and on a spot basis, together with amounts available under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility, will
be sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements. Furthermore, the potentially impaired credit
worthiness of our customers in light of the worsening macro-economic environment may make it more
difficult or costly for us to do so, which could in turn harm our liquidity position to the extent other
credit lines will not be available at that time for any reasons. More generally, delays in payments by our
largest customers, requests for modifications to their contractual payment arrangements or defaults on
their payment obligations to us could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We are subject to the risk of litigation, tax and regulatory investigations, quality audits by our_**
**_customers and other claims._**

From time to time, we are involved in litigation including, amongst others, product liability claims,
labor law related claims, litigation related to competition law, anti-trust law, tax law and patent law as
well as other legal proceedings with customers, suppliers, distributors, agents, product developers,


-----

external workers, advisors and sales employees and others. In addition, we are currently involved in a
dispute against Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Siciliana for unpaid invoices. As of December 31,
2022, our total exposure to Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Siciliana amounted to €131.1 million.
For a description of these and other material ongoing legal proceedings, see “Business—Legal
_Proceedings.” In the aftermath of public health measures implemented in the jurisdictions in which we_
operate as well as the various personnel initiatives that we implemented since the beginning of the
COVID-19 pandemic, we could be subject to an increase in litigation, in particular in relation to our
vendors and our employees, including with respect to health and safety measures.

In the course of our business, we are also subject to other proceedings, such as regulatory and tax
investigations and audits as well as inspections by tax and other regulatory authorities, which may
expose us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including penalties and suspension or
disqualification from procurement contracting. For example, in July 2021 our subsidiary Nexen
received a tax questionnaire by competent tax authorities, relating to certain tax charges indicated in the
tax declaration for the year 2016. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we did not receive any
tax assessment by the competent tax authorities in connection with this proceeding. In addition, in 2021
our subsidiary Livebox received a claim from Italian tax authorities for approximately €4 million in
connection with VAT credits. We have challenged such claim and, as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the relevant opposition proceeding is still open. In the meantime, we asked the relevant
tax authorities to initiate a settlement procedure of the pending tax dispute pursuant to applicable law,
which will result in the cancellation of interests and penalties, while the relevant amount was already
reimbursed to the Company by the prior owner of Livebox. We expect the opposition proceeding to be
closed by the competent court following such settlement. Furthermore, a general tax audit for direct and
indirect tax purposes related to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was initiated in relation to our
Subsidiary Engineering Sardegna, and is currently pending. While we cannot predict the outcome of
such audit, as of the date of the Offering Memorandum, it has not resulted in any claims from tax
authorities. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the inspection is still ongoing. Changes in the
interpretation of applicable tax laws by the competent tax authorities may result in certain fines and
unpaid taxes becoming payable by us, as a result of non-compliance with such tax laws.

The Be Acquisition Agreement contains a special indemnity from the Sellers providing that, subject to
certain conditions and exceptions and up to an agreed amount, the Sellers will indemnify and hold us
harmless for any taxes that will be paid by Be and/or any of its subsidiaries to the competent authorities
as a consequence of certain voluntary disclosures, settlement procedures, voluntary correction of tax
returns (“ravvedimento operoso”), audits or assessments. However, there can be no guarantee that we
would be able to enforce such indemnity and that any recovery made under the Be Acquisition
Agreement would cover any and all potential losses arising out of any of such proceedings. Even if we
are able to eventually recover any losses resulting therefrom, we may temporarily be required to bear
any such losses ourselves. Notwithstanding the outcome of any ongoing settlement procedure with the
tax authorities, there can also be no assurance that such authorities will not initiate a criminal
enforcement action against Be and its directors. See “—Risks Related to the Be Acquisition—The Be
_Group may have liabilities that are not known to us or greater than anticipated, and any indemnities_
_under the Be Acquisition Agreement or other agreements may be insufficient.”_

In addition, we are typically required to comply with certain quality standards in connection with the
provision of certain services to our customers and, pursuant to some of our contracts, our customers are
entitled to certain audit rights in regards to our compliance with such standards. Any finding of our noncompliance resulting from these audits could result in breach of contract claims and negative publicity
which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. See “Business—Quality Assurance.”

When we determine that a significant risk of a future claim against us exists, we record provisions in
an amount equal to our estimated liability. As of December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, we had set aside
non-current provisions for pending legal proceedings of €3.3* million, €3.5* million and €4.7 million
(including €0.4 million for the Be Group), respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Be


-----

Group had set aside non-current provisions for pending proceedings and for bonus payments of €3.9
million and €7.5 million. There can be no assurance that our provisions will be sufficient to cover our
actual litigation costs. Any failure to prevail in current or future litigation or to accurately predict the
amounts at stake in a litigation or the likelihood of prevailing in any such litigation could result in
unfavorable outcomes that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_We have made and may make acquisitions or enter into transactions that may present risks, and we_**
**_may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction_**
**_and, additionally, there are risks associated with the integration of any acquisitions._**

Pursuing strategic and opportunistic acquisitions of product and service providers is a key component
of our business strategy. Between 2020 and 2022, we acquired 9 business units and companies
(including the Be Acquisition). Some of these acquisitions were material, including the acquisitions of
the Be Group and Atlantic Technologies S.p.A. in 2022 and of Design Automation Associates, C
Consulting and Movilitas Group in 2021. Despite our successful track-record of acquisition and
integration of new businesses into our operations, there can be no guarantee that we will continue to be
able to successfully identify suitable acquisitions or complete any particular acquisition, combination
or other transaction on acceptable terms, which could prevent us from achieving our strategic goals.
Our ability to acquire new businesses may be limited by many factors, including availability of
financing or its conditions, debt covenants, complex ownership structures among potential targets and
government regulation and competition from other potential acquirers. In addition, our debt burden may
increase if we borrow funds to finance any future acquisition, which could have a negative impact on
our cash flows and our ability to finance our overall operations and pay interest on our indebtedness,
including the Notes.

Any integration process may require significant time and resources, which may disrupt our day-to-day
business and divert management’s attention, and we may not be able to manage the integration process
successfully. Even if we are successful in acquiring new businesses, the integration of such businesses
may prove to be more difficult than we initially anticipated and could create unforeseen operating
difficulties and expenditures. Integrations can be difficult and unpredictable also as a result of the
complexity of software and due to the fact that acquired technologies are typically developed
independently and may not have been designed to integrate with our products. Such difficulties are
compounded when the products involved are well-established, as compatibility with the existing base
of installed products must be preserved, and/or when the size of the acquired business is significant as
compared to our size. Successful integration also requires coordination of different development and
engineering teams, which could be difficult and unpredictable due to cultural conflicts and different
opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps. Acquisitions also pose certain other risks, for
example, difficulties or delays in consolidating operations and achieving anticipated synergies, cost
savings, revenues and cash flow enhancements, growth, operational efficiencies and other benefits,
diversion of managerial resources away from our day-to-day business operations, overpayment for the
acquired business, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities to the extent that we issue new
shares to fund an acquisition and the assumption of unexpected liabilities and undisclosed risks.

Certain contracts of the businesses acquired by us contain “change of control” provisions that require
the acquired company to notify the counterparty of a potential change of control, or contain language
that could be interpreted as allowing, subject to certain conditions, the counterparty to terminate the
contract. Although the agreements governing certain of our acquisitions require the target to use
commercially reasonable endeavors to obtain consents or waivers relating to such “change of control”
provisions prior to closing of the acquisitions, such consents and waivers are generally not a condition
to closing. If a substantial number of these contracts have been, are or will be terminated as a result of
our acquisition, we may be forced to enter into new contracts on less favorable terms, or we may be
unable to secure replacements. While we strive to mitigate unexpected liabilities and risks through
contractual protections in our acquisition documentation, we cannot ensure that such protections will
be effective. For example, although the share sale and purchase agreements pursuant to which we


-----

acquire businesses typically contain warranties related to, among other things, compliance with laws,
licenses and consents and financial crime, and provides, subject to certain qualifications and limitations,
for indemnification from the seller in the event of breach of warranties, we cannot guarantee that we
will be successful in any claims that we may bring against the relevant sellers for breach of warranties
based on the relevant agreement or that any recovery made under this agreement would cover the
potential losses arising out of any such breach. In addition, if we enter into an acquisition agreement,
but the acquisition is not consummated, we may be liable for break-up fees or other payments, which
may, in some cases, be material and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

Finally, certain of the businesses we have acquired are operated through strategic partnerships with
other investors who hold a non-controlling interest in the relevant company and might have interests
conflicting with ours.

**_Our cost saving measures may prove to be ineffective._**

In order to support our business model and increase our margins, we launched a number of cost saving
initiatives starting in 2017 with the aim of streamlining our operations and achieve annual run rate cost
savings, including management of vendors’ rates, workforce optimization measures such as the nearshoring of approximately 270 full-time (as at December 31, 2022) employees to Serbia, as well as other
cost-saving initiatives regarding for example the reduction of travel expenses. Starting in 2022, we
began implementing a comprehensive range of additional cost savings and efficiency initiatives aimed
at enhancing our operations and improving our ability to respond to changes in the demand for our
products and solutions, by further increasing the flexibility of our cost structure. In the aggregate, we
expect our cost savings and efficiency initiatives to generate €16.2 million of run rate cost savings by
the end of 2023 (€9.8 million of which have been already achieved for the year ended December 31,
2022). Our key cost savings and efficiency initiatives include: (A) procurement initiatives, consisting
of: (i) the streamlining of our contractual relationships with external IT consultants through the
introduction of competitive tender procedures and a structured supplier qualification process, and (ii)
the reduction of costs related to the procurement of software products, primarily by consolidating our
current software providers base into a limited number of distributors and resellers, and consolidating
our IT spend with certain selected OEMs; (B) optimization initiatives targeting the reduction of utilities,
maintenance and rent costs related to our real estate portfolio, including the reduction of our square
footage at multiple locations and office closures in up to three out of 13 non-strategic locations in Italy
as well as the opening of a new flagship office in Milan (Italy); and (C) a broad range of other cost
saving initiatives including the outsourcing of payroll activities, the implementation of headcount
optimization and reduction projects including nearshoring activities in Serbia and adjacent countries,
rationalization projects aimed at consolidating our legal structure, and vendor rebate management
activities. Once achieved, we expect that these cost savings will structurally reduce the Group’s cost
base going forward.

The achievement of these cost savings partly depends on factors that are outside of our control,
including the renegotiation of certain contract terms with our vendors, suppliers and business partners,
and we may therefore be unable to implement some or all of such initiatives and/or generate the
expected benefits therefrom within the expected timeframe or at all. Furthermore, the costs we incur in
trying to realize these cost savings initiatives and other benefits described herein may be substantially
higher than our current estimates, including due to the impact on the economy and our business of the
current inflationary surge and uncertain macroeconomic environment, and may outweigh any benefit.
As a result we may not be able to achieve some or all of our targeted cost savings or incur additional
unexpected costs.

**_The financial information of Be included in this Offering Memorandum, on a stand-alone basis and_**
**_combined with the financial information of the Group, has been derived from Be’s financial_**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain historical financial information of the Be Group for the
years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022. In addition, in this Offering Memorandum we present
certain unaudited aggregated financial information and other data of the Group for the year ended
December 31, 2022, as if the Be Acquisition and the acquisition of certain other companies completed
in 2022 had occurred on January 1, 2022. The Be Group’s historical financial information has been
derived from Be’s financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, and neither such information
nor the unaudited aggregated financial information of the Issuer and the Be Group included in this
Offering Memorandum and has been prepared by us, or audited or reviewed by the Issuer’s auditors.
The historical financial information of Be and the unaudited aggregated financial information and other
data of the Group included in this Offering Memorandum is being presented for illustrative purposes
only; in addition, the historical financial information of Be is not intended to represent, or be indicative
of, and is not necessarily comparable to, our own historical financial information and may not have

**_We may not realize any or all of the adjustments to Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA included_**
**_in the Offering Memorandum._**

This Offering Memorandum presents certain pro forma adjusted financial data which are based on
various assumptions. See “Summary Historical and Certain Other Financial Data—Other Financial
_Information and As Adjusted Data” for additional details regarding these pro forma adjustments to Pro_
Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA and their underlying assumptions. These assumptions are based on
our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties, further assumptions and other factors that
may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated
future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such pro forma adjusted financial
data. This Offering Memorandum presents estimated Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA figures
that result from certain assumptions and adjustments that we have made for (i) the acquisition of certain
companies and business units in 2022, that are based on the results of such companies as derived from
the financial statements and/or management accounts of the respective targets, as applicable, and that
include certain assumptions and adjustments, (ii) the estimated run rate impact on our results from
certain cost saving initiatives that we have started implementing in 2022 and that we intend to fully
implement by the end of 2023 as if such measures had been fully implemented on January 1, 2022,
based on certain management’s estimates and assumptions, (iii) the Adjusted EBITDA of the Be Group
for the year ended December 31, 2022 to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s Adjusted
EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022, as if the Be Group had been fully consolidated into
our results on January 1, 2022, based on the financial statements of Be presented in accordance with
IFRS, and (iv) the estimated effect on our results of certain cost savings that we expect to generate
following completion of the Be Acquisition, through cost savings synergies from the integration of the
Be Group into our business that we expect to fully realize by the end of 2024 as if Be had been fully
consolidated in our financial statements from, and such measures had been fully implemented on,
January 1, 2022. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and may not give an
accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or results of our actions, initiatives and acquisitions


-----

for the period presented. The pro forma adjustments to Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA include
adjustments for annualized cost savings. In addition, the achievement of cost savings partly depends on
factors that are outside of our control, including the renegotiation of certain contract terms with our
vendors, suppliers and business partners, and we may therefore be unable to implement some or all of
such initiatives and/or generate the expected benefits therefrom within the expected timeframe or at all.
There can be no assurance that we will realize anticipated additional revenue and cost savings in a
timely manner or at all and that the costs to be incurred to realize any expected cost savings synergies
may be substantially higher than our current estimates and may outweigh the benefits. Our anticipated
cost savings synergies are based on assumptions about our ability to implement these measures in a
timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. If one or more of our underlying assumptions
regarding these initiatives proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher
costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated timeframe, the
expected benefits. Some of the factors that could cause our future financial performance to differ
materially from that expressed or implied by such pro forma adjusted financial data include: not
achieving the level of EBITDA and/or the level of revenue and/or cost savings that we expect, increase
in the amount of costs to be incurred to realize the expected cost savings synergies, changes in the
accounting principles or policies that are applied, or if the relevant acquisitions are delayed or not
completed in whole or in part. If any of these or other factors cause our actual financial performance to
differ significantly from that implied by the pro forma financial data presented, they could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

**_Our sales bookings may be subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and are, therefore,_**
**_an uncertain indicator of our future earnings; changes affecting our sales bookings may have a_**
**_significant negative financial impact on our business, financial position and results of operations)._**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present data regarding our sales bookings. Our sales bookings consist
of (i) revenues that we expect to generate from customer orders in the relevant reference period, in
respect to which we started providing services and which, therefore, generate backlog in such period,
and (ii) the share of revenues that is contractually guaranteed under our multi-year framework
agreements with customers with respect to a reference period, including in advance of receiving the
underlying customer orders. Our sales bookings are subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations
by our customers and are, therefore, an uncertain indicator of our future earnings. Since sales bookings
are based on several assumptions and estimates, including assumptions, they are not necessarily
indicative of our expected revenues, cash flows or results of operations. If customers change or cancel
sales that we have in our bookings, our expected revenues would be reduced, and we may be unable to
secure replacement sales from such customers or other customers. Furthermore, there is no certainty
that our sales bookings will generate revenues, cash flows, or other results of operation at the time we
expect. Unforeseen circumstances, including, _inter alia, change of orders, changes to the financial_
position of our customers, increased time required to fill orders, macroeconomic and geopolitical events
or other unforeseen occurrences, may affect orders comprising our sales bookings, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

**_Industry consolidation could affect prices or demand for our products._**

Although the Italian IT industry is still relatively fragmented, consolidation is increasing and our
acquisition of the Be Group confirms such trend. For example, Google and TIM have recently partnered
to provide cloud-based services in Italy, Amazon Web Services has recently expanded its global cloudbased services into Italy, and Microsoft and Poste Italiane have partnered to provide cloud and other
services to Italian companies and public-sector entities. Consolidation trends in our industry may result
in new competitors with greater scale, a broader geographic footprint, better technologies and greater
price efficiencies entering or servicing the markets in which we operate. This trend could create
opportunities for large enterprise software and hardware companies, including our partners, to increase
their market share including through the acquisition of companies that are strong in certain lucrative
market niches or that have broad installed customer bases. In doing so, these competitors may be able
to reduce prices on products or software that compete with our solutions, also by leveraging their larger


-----

economies of scale, which may result in a decrease of the demand for our products and, in turn, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects.

**_Cybersecurity issues could impact our business._**

We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and
store electronic information and to communicate internally and with our customers, partners and
vendors. As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of
the increased use of mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services in recent years, the
potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases. For example, we consider financially
motivated cybercrimes to be among the top current threats to our data, due to their high degree of
sophistication, their ability to exploit system vulnerabilities as well as result in identity thefts. Such
breaches and cyberattacks could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data of, among
others, our employees, customers, contractors, vendors and other business partners, as well as personal
data stored on our products or through our services by our customers, which may result in damage to
our reputation and brand and adversely affect our relationships with our customers. For example, the
Be Group suffered cyberattacks in the past. Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving and have
increased in sophistication and speed in recent years, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and
defending against them. Moreover, geopolitical tensions such as the ongoing military confrontation
between Russia and Ukraine may increase the risk of cyberattack, including cyberattacks by state actors
or others in retaliation against the sanctions imposed by the international community, as well as
cyberattacks by other actors directed against our local operations in Italy, or otherwise seeking to take
advantage of the ongoing crisis. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated
nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, particularly if perpetrated by state actors, as well as
the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or
vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on one of our customers
and its customers.

The risk of such attacks includes breaches and attempted breaches not only of our own products,
services and systems, but also of those of our customers, advisors, employees, contractors, business
partners, vendors and other third parties as well as of third-party systems on which we rely to operate
our digital platforms. Successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error
could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or
destruction of our data or systems or those of our customers or other third parties, theft of sensitive,
regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, loss of access
to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means, and business delays,
service or system disruptions or denials of service. Furthermore, certain industries in which our
customers operate, including the healthcare and finance industries, require heightened standards for the
handling of sensitive data and can be subject to regulatory overview, which can result in an increase in
our compliance expenses and negative publicity for our products and services in case of a breach or
attempted breach. For example, in July 2021 a cyberattack targeted the data center and IT network of
Regione Lazio (one of our customers), affecting the provision of certain services to the public including,
among others, booking systems for COVID-19 vaccinations and other healthcare services. Substantially
simultaneously with such attack, we successfully deflected an unauthorized attempt to breach our
systems, and subsequently, in early August 2021, we recorded a potential breach of VPN access
credentials we manage as part of the services offered to another customer. While investigations by
competent authorities confirmed the absence of any connection between the cyberattack against
Regione Lazio and the two separate cyberattacks that have targeted our systems, our reputation has been
negatively impacted by early media reports mistakenly linking the cyberattack against Regione Lazio
to a successful breach of our IT infrastructure, despite the absence of any connection or responsibility
from our end in such events.

In the event of any such attacks or actions, we, our customers and other third parties could be exposed
to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as to the loss of


-----

existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. In addition,
the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation
measures could be significant. We also experience and respond to cybersecurity threats from time to
time. As our business and the cybersecurity landscape evolve, we may also find it necessary to make
significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. However, there can be no assurance
that such investments will prevent future cyberattacks or other threats from occurring which may result
in material adverse effects on our business and operations. In addition, the trend to publicize
vulnerabilities discovered in our industry increases the risks posed by these attacks and the potential
costs that we, our partners and/or our customers might have to incur to respond and remediate to any of
such attacks. Any of the foregoing, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects. See “—Risks Related to the Be
_Acquisition—Be may have liabilities that are not known to us or greater than anticipated, and any_
_indemnities under the Be Acquisition Agreement or other Agreements may be insufficient.”_

**_Damage or disruptions to our technical infrastructure and facilities could adversely affect our_**
**_customers’ businesses and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results_**
**_of operations._**

Our success largely depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our technical
infrastructure in order to provide services to our customers. Our contracts for the provision of services
often guarantee only minimal downtime of the services that we provide. In particular, we are dependent
on the uninterrupted performance of our three data centers, which are central to the IT infrastructure
and services we offer to our customers and on which we rely for our own operations. We also rely on
uninterrupted access to the wider power and telecommunications network, and any significant failure,
damage or destruction of the basic infrastructure such as power and telecommunications systems in the
locations in which we operate, could affect the quality of our services and cause service interruption.
Our infrastructure may be damaged in natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods or fires, due to wars
or terrorist attacks, or be subject to damage or compromise from human error, technical disruptions,
unauthorized access, power failure, computer glitches and viruses, telecommunications failures, adverse
weather conditions and other unforeseen events. Any of such events may cause disruptions to
information systems for sustained periods, result in system interruptions outages or delays in our
systems or deterioration in their performance, which could impair our ability to operate our business.

As many of our services play a business-critical role for our customers, any damage to or failure of the
infrastructure we rely on (even if temporary), could disrupt our ability to deliver information to and
provide services for our customers in a timely manner. Enhancing our IT systems and applications to
achieve improved stability and redundancy, as well as putting in place remedies to resolve a disruption
or other interruption of our IT services, may be time-consuming and expensive and may require
resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain. If we are unable to invest in maintaining and
improving our IT systems and applications, the likelihood of the occurrence of system interruptions
may increase. While we have developed certain contingency and disaster recovery plans and maintain
backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of these types of events, such plans and systems
might not be fully redundant or sufficient. Our data centers’ redundancy mechanisms could fail,
resulting in damages, data loss, service interruptions and other disruptions of our IT systems and
applications, any of which could severely affect our ability to operate our business. In addition, our
property damage insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the costs of repairing the damage
caused from such disruptive events or such events may only partially be covered under our policies or
not at all. If we are unable to operate our business as a result of any significant or sustained interruption
of our technical infrastructure could have a negative effect on our services and result in damages for
breach of contract, litigation, reputational damage and could ultimately result in the loss of current
and/or potential customers or in reduced business from current customers which, in turn could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.


-----

**_Failure to deliver timely and effective implementation of our services to our customers and maintain_**
**_sufficient levels of support and maintenance services post-implementation could have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business._**

Our services and solutions typically follow a strict timeline for implementation, rely on integration with
existing customer systems and, in some cases, require post-deployment maintenance and support
services. In general, system implementation, migrations and integrations can be impacted by unforeseen
challenges in delivering solutions on time and to budget. Due to the length and complexity of some
implementations and the ongoing evolution of product cycles, we may face unforeseen issues with
service deliveries that can have an adverse impact on customer satisfaction and profitability. If our
customers are dissatisfied with the quality of our services and decide to terminate the integration of our
products with their existing systems, we may incur costs that we would not be able to offset with
revenues we were expecting to generate from such services.

If we do not provide effective or timely ongoing support, our ability to sell additional services to existing
customers or our ability to retain such customers may be adversely affected and our reputation within
the market, including with potential customers, could be damaged. In addition, support for the majority
of our services and solutions can be provided by third-parties, and our failure to meet our clients’
expectations may result in third- parties capturing a portion of revenue streams generated from support
operations on our products and services. In addition, to the extent that we are unsuccessful in hiring,
training and retaining adequate support resources, our ability to provide adequate and timely support
and maintenance services to our customers will be negatively impacted, and our customers’ satisfaction
with our services may be adversely affected. Our failure to provide and maintain high-quality support
and maintenance services could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**_We rely on the reputation of our brand._**

Our business depends in part on a strong brand image, and any negative impact on the reputation of,
and value associated with, our brand name could adversely affect our business. Our brand, image and
reputation represent an important part of our business and are dependent on our top-of-the-market
service offering, our contractual performance, the maintenance of good relationships with our
customers, compliance with applicable laws and successful management of disputes that occasionally
arise in our day-to-day business activities. Furthermore, we operate and provide services to customers
in sensitive environments, such as to our customers in our Finance, Health, Public Administration and
Energy & Utilities industry verticals, the specificities of which continuously expose us to factors outside
of our control that may negatively affect our reputation. Adverse publicity, legal action or other factors
could lead to substantial erosion in the value of our brand, which could lead to decreased demand and
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Successful cyber-attacks or technical issues could also negatively impact the market perception of the
effectiveness of our products and harm our ability to keep existing customers and to attract new
customers.

**_Our profitability may suffer if we are not able to obtain favorable pricing, manage our costs_**
**_effectively, or if we underestimate the scope of work or the cost of performance of our contracts._**

If we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, our revenues and
profitability could be materially and negatively impacted. The rates we are able to charge for our
services and solutions are affected by a number of factors, including:

- general economic, political and market conditions;

- customers’ perceptions of our ability to add value through our services;

- our customers’ desire or need to control or reduce their costs;


-----

- the general competitive environment in our industry (including new competitors entering the
market);

- the introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors;

- public appropriations for IT spending; and

- the procurement practices of customers and their use of third party advisors.

Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is also dependent on our being able to successfully
manage our costs, including personnel costs, which accounted for 50% and 52% of our total operating
expenses in the year ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021. Our cost
management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services
and solutions and our resource capacity, including staff utilization levels. We have implemented and
continue to implement remote-working policies following the first outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic. We have incurred and continue to incur substantial costs in relation to such policies, which
may increase going forward.

In addition, our revenues and profit levels may be negatively affected during periods of rapid inflation
such as the current inflationary spike in the European Union, including Italy, in the United Kingdom
and the United States, as a result of a combination of decreased consumer spending across all of our
industry verticals, and an increase in fixed costs, such as energy and logistics costs, as well as potential
competitive pricing pressure, which may limit our ability to increase prices in order to pass through the
cost of inflation to our customers (while we are planning to include automatic pass-through provisions
in future agreements, to partially offset inflation costs, our current customer agreements do not include
automatic price adjustment mechanisms).

Finally, our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost
necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to
be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our
contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a customer’s satisfaction, our contracts
could generate lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The loss of certain customers or a decrease in business volume from these customers may have_**
**_negative effects on our business._**

Our largest customers represent a significant percentage of our revenues. In the year ended December
31, 2022, our largest customer and our top ten customers accounted for approximately 5.8% and 30.0%
of our revenues, respectively, in each case after giving effect to the Be Acquisition as if it had been
completed on January 1, 2022. In addition, Be’s largest customer and top ten customers accounted for
28.2% and 65.5% of Be’s revenues over the same period, respectively.

We operate our business on the basis of framework agreements with our public sector customers.
Framework agreements with our public sector customers typically have a duration of between two and
five years. Contracts with our private sector customers typically have a duration of between one and
two years and feature renewal clauses. Our customers are generally required to pay us within 60 days
from receipt of the relevant invoice. Moreover, most of our contracts, including our framework
agreements with entities in the public sector, do not require the customer to commit a minimum amount
of revenues.

Our customers typically have no obligation to renew their contracts with us upon expiration, and even
if they do, they may not renew with a similar contract period or with the same or a greater amount of
committed revenues to us. In particular, our customers may decide not to renew their contracts with us
if they are dissatisfied with our services, our prices or the actual or perceived quality, durability or
security of our software or platforms. Additionally, our success also depend on relationships we develop


-----

with our respective customers that enable to understand our customers’ needs and deliver solutions and
services that are tailored to meet those needs. Since we usually provide our customers with products
and services relating to a combination of our Proprietary Solutions, Digitech and System Integration
activities, and given the high share of revenues that our top customers represent of the aggregated
revenues of the Group, the loss of a major customer, or a significant reduction in volume of business
from an existing major customer, for instance as a result of such customer being dissatisfied with the
quality of our work, our failure to meet performance standards under our contracts, or our noncompliance with the provisions of our contractual agreements or applicable regulatory requirements,
may result in our inability to sell additional services to such customer, the loss of business volume from
such customer or the loss of the customer altogether.

In addition, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could cause a reduction in business
volume from a customer or the loss of a customer, including reduced technology spending in response
to a challenging economic or competitive environment, consolidation, business or financial
deterioration or failure and, in the case of public sector contracts, a decrease in public IT spending
appropriations. If any of these events were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects as well as on our ability to
perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_A significant proportion of our revenues is generated from contracts awarded through competitive_**
**_bidding processes, which require substantial time and resource investments and may be challenged_**
**_by losing bidders._**

Our customers (including a very small portion of Be’s customers), include municipal, local and regional
government entities, which often require competitive bidding procedures in order to award contracts.
Competitive bidding imposes substantial costs and presents a number of risks, including: the substantial
cost and managerial time and effort that we spend to prepare bids and proposals, for contracts that may
or may not be awarded to us; the need to accurately estimate the resources and costs that will be required
to implement and service any contracts we are awarded, sometimes in advance of the final determination
of their full scope and design and to consider such estimated resources and costs in the context of a
competitive tender process in order to submit a price quote that is competitive but not so low as to be
loss-making if we win the bid, and the opportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts
that we might otherwise pursue. Over the past few years, and mostly for central government activities,
there has been a shift in the manner public administration and healthcare tenders are run, from a
fragmented approach, whereby the relevant local public administration or other public entity launches
a local tender to satisfy its individual IT services requirements, to a more integrated approach, whereby
centralized purchasing agencies consolidate the purchasing function of the individual public
administrations through the execution of framework agreements. Such agencies, including CONSIP,
function as a centralized purchasing agency on behalf of many public administrations and healthcare
customers and manage any relevant public tenders.

In addition, if any bids are unsuccessful, we may from time to time challenge tender procedures or
outcomes. For example, in 2022 we challenged the awarding to a competitor of a public tender for the
development of the accounting system for the Piedmont Region health system. The challenge was
decided against us by the first instance court, and therefore we have filed an appeal, which is currently
pending. Similarly, competitors frequently challenge contracts awarded to us under competitive public
tenders. For example, in 2022 we won a public tender by AMA S.p.A. as part of a temporary joint
venture, which was subsequently challenged by our competitor Sei Consulting on the basis of the
alleged illegitimacy of the score attributed to them by the tending authority. The administrative court
rejected Sei Consulting’s claim and ruled in our favor by issuing a first instance judgement that is
expected to become definitive on June 8, 2023. In 2021, TIM filed a claim in relation to a tender process
for the awarding by CONSIP of a number of framework contracts governing the procurement of cloud
and project management office (“PMO”) services, which we have settled. In addition, in 2021 the
Company was excluded from a public tender by Consip S.p.A., based on the alleged violation of certain
integrity obligations as a consequence of the protracted investigation involving ATM. Moreover, in


-----

2022, certain competitors challenged the awarding to our subsidiary EDH, as part of a temporary joint
venture, of a public tender for the management of the workstations of the Lombardia Region and of
other governmental bodies. Challenges can be time-consuming for management, and divert their
attention from the day-to-day operation of our business, as well as being costly, and there can be no
guarantee that a challenge will be successful. In addition, any claims for alleged misrepresentations in
our bids and proposals could also result in litigation as well as in our exclusion from awarded tender
procedures and bans from participating in ongoing and future tenders. We may be required to incur
significant costs and divert management’s attention to defend ourselves against these challenges. Such
costs can be material and involve subsequent litigation that can take years to resolve. If any of these
challenges is successful, we may be required to resubmit our bid or the awarded contract may be
terminated or amounts payable thereunder may be reduced, which may result in a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in order to participate
to public tenders or enter into certain contracts with our customers, we may be required to obtain
performance bonds or other similar guarantees. See also “—We may be unable to obtain the bid bonds,
_performance bonds, securities or guarantees we need to compete in certain public tenders or to enter_
_into certain contracts with our private customers, and due to our failure to perform our obligations,_
_counterparties may enforce bid and performance bonds we have posted.”_

**_We rely to a significant extent on the banking and financial services industries and are exposed to_**
**_trends in such industries._**

We rely to a significant extent on customers in the banking and financial services industries, which we
serve through our Finance industry vertical. Following completion of the Be Acquisition, we expect
such reliance to have increased, as approximately 93.4% of Be’s total revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2022, fit in our Finance industry vertical, with the remaining portion of Be’s revenues
for the same period being allocated to our other industry verticals. In the year ended December 31,
2022, after giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other
companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had
occurred on January 1, 2022, we generated 29% of our total revenues from the Finance industry vertical.
Our results of operations rely on our capacity to retain customers in such industries and our capacity to
continue to provide them with software, digital solutions and IT services that they require. Any failure
to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Adverse trends in the banking
and financial services industries, such as an economic downturn, consolidation in the sector granting
certain of our customers increased bargaining power, or increased regulation of the contracts, software,
digital solutions and IT services used in the banking and financial services industry could result in
reduced demand for our software, digital solutions and IT services, resulting in a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We rely in part on third party providers to deliver our services to customers._**

Our ability to service our customers and deliver and implement solutions depends in part on third party
providers such as subcontractors, equipment components manufacturers, utility providers and network
providers meeting their obligations to us and our requirements and expectations in a timely, quality
manner. In particular, large and complex projects often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our
services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure
requirements of other vendors and service providers, including of our partners. Our profitability
depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products
and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our
effective oversight of their performance. In addition, we provide implementation, maintenance and
other services to our clients with respect to software and platforms created or provided by third parties.
Such third parties may disagree with the way we implement, maintain or provide our services with
respect to their products to our customers or may claim that we interfere with their relationship with our
customer, as a result of which we could become liable for damages or our relationship with our customer
could be negatively impacted. Our services to customers rely on both large third party providers such
as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce, RedHat and small third party providers such as


-----

Tibco and VMware. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected and we might incur significant additional liabilities if any of our third party providers ceases
its operations, does not meet its obligations or customer expectations, or if it terminates or refuses to
renew its relationships with us or seeks to renegotiate prices or other terms of our contracts with them
at more onerous terms for us.

**_Our customers may choose to implement or use products, IT services and digital solutions developed_**
**_by our partners rather than products, IT services and digital solutions developed by us._**

We offer products and services of our partners that sometimes compete with our own products and
services. For example, we offer our Proprietary Solutions for billing and CRM NETA to our Energy &
Utilities customers, which are in direct competition with similar products developed by third-party
providers such as SAP that we also sell. If our customers choose to purchase the third parties solutions
of our partners over our products, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected due
to the lower margins that we generate when customers choose to do so.

**_Continued increases in electricity costs may adversely affect our results of operations._**

We are dependent on a constant supply of electricity in order to manage our data centers and our
operations. If, for any reason, certain of our electricity supply contracts were terminated or were not
renewed upon expiration, or if market conditions were to substantially change resulting in a significant
increase in the price of electricity, including as a result of the ongoing inflationary surge as well as the
military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we may not be able to find alternative, comparable
suppliers or suppliers capable of providing electricity on terms or in amounts satisfactory to us. In
addition, since the number of electricity suppliers in Italy is generally limited, we may not be able to
negotiate favorable terms when our energy supply agreements are up for renewal and we may be
required to accept significant increases in the costs of our energy purchases, including as a result of the
ongoing inflationary surge as well as the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In particular,
our utilities costs (including energy, gas and water costs) increased by 122.2%* from €2.7* million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 to €3.4* million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and
increased further by 92.5%* from €3.4* million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €6.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022. Moreover, for the year ended December 31, 2022, our electricity
costs increased by 83.9%* to €6.1 million, compared to electricity costs of €3.3* million for the year
ended December 31, 2021. While we do not maintain a hedging strategy in place for our energy costs,
in light of the current macroeconomic conditions we are reviewing the structure of our customer
contracts and are planning to include inflation pass-through provisions going forward. However, we
may not be able to agree such energy costs-related price adjustments with our customers, in part or at
all, or may only be able to pass them through on a delayed basis, which could reduce our margins, either
temporarily or for an extended period of time. As a result of any of these events, our business, financial
condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.

**_Some of our products and services are developed using third party open source software components_**
**_and any failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source licenses could restrict our_**
**_ability to sell our products or increase our operating expenses._**

We use a limited amount of software licensed by our authors or other third parties under so-called “open
source” licenses. For example, our Digital Enabler software on which we created our Eng-DE4Bios
solutions is developed by using open source software components called generic enablers from
FIWARE. Some open source licenses contain requirements that the licensee make available source code
for modifications or derivative works created based upon the type of open source software used. If our
proprietary software is combined with open source software, we could be required, in certain
circumstances, to release some of our proprietary software to the public, which may result in our
proprietary software becoming generally available. In addition, usage of open source software can lead
to greater risks than use of third party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not
provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. Additionally, the terms of many open source


-----

licenses have not been interpreted by courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in
a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our
solutions.

If we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to
take remedial actions, including by seeking licenses from third parties, continue offering products on
terms that are not commercially viable, re-engineer products or discontinue the licensing of such
products if re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or make generally available some
of the source code of our proprietary software. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property proprietary rights and prevent_**
**_others from making unauthorized use of such rights._**

The success of our business depends on our ability to protect and enforce our trade secrets, copyrights,
patents and other intellectual property rights including through our ability to enforce contractual
arrangements designed to protect such intellectual property rights. Our trademark registrations include,
_inter alia, the signs of Engineering, Engineering IT Works. Ellipse, AREAS, Ipsos, IQC Team, Innodo,_
Grace, infofattura, In4Mef, Qualipso, Bitglue, Movilitas, Trend, spagobi and DEUS TECHNOLOGY.
We have taken steps to protect our intellectual property under trade secret, copyright, trademark and
patent laws, as well as through contractual arrangements, all of which offer protection, provided that all
relevant requirements for protection of each intellectual property assets are satisfied. Despite our efforts
to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may not be deterred from misuse, theft
or misappropriation of them, including trade secrets and information that we regard as proprietary. We
have filed various applications for the registration of our intellectual property in Italy and in certain
other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our applications may not be granted, our existing protections
may expire and we may fail to obtain such protections in the future. Additionally, the process of
obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all
necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.

Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, expensive and timeconsuming. Attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to
assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us, or take unilateral steps to invalidate our
intellectual property rights, which could result in a holding or official action that invalidates or narrows
the scope of our rights, in whole or in part. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights (including
copyrights and trade secrets on our software and technologies), we may be at a competitive disadvantage
compared to others who have not incurred the additional expense, time and effort which may be required
to protect the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date. Any of these events
could materially adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and prospects.

Our patents and other intellectual property, with particular reference to trade secrets, may not prevent
competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to ours. Our
ability to protect our intellectual property could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal
principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of
patents.

**_If our applications or services are found to infringe third parties’ intellectual property rights or_**
**_misuse the confidential information of others, we may become liable for damages and face_**
**_invalidation of our intellectual property rights._**

The technology services industry is characterized by frequent claims and related litigation regarding
patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. These claims may be asserted by operating
companies as well as companies which do not manufacture or sell products and whose sole purpose is
to assert patent rights against third parties in an attempt to collect license fees. Our strategic partners or
our customers. In this respect, most of our customer contracts typically require us to indemnify


-----

customers against claims that our products infringe third parties’ intellectual property rights or misuse
the confidential information of third parties. Such claims, whether with or without merit, are timeconsuming, may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us.

Successful claims of infringement, misuse or misappropriation by a third party against us or a third
party that we indemnify could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain
services or could otherwise require us to pay substantial damages, an accounting of profits, royalties or
other fees. Such claims could also require us to cease making, licensing or using products that allegedly
infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights or misuse the confidential information of
others, to expend additional development resources in an attempt to redesign our products or services
or otherwise to develop alternative technology that does not infringe, misuse or misappropriate such
intellectual property rights, or to enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in
order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, confidential information or intellectual property
rights. For example, in July 2022 a competitor commenced legal proceedings against us and the Italian
Ministry of Justice, which is currently pending, alleging the violation of its own intellectual property
right by a software owned by the Italian Ministry of Justice, in relation to which we provide maintenance
services. The first hearing is scheduled for May 11, 2023. Defending against claims of infringement or
being deemed to be infringing the intellectual property rights or misusing the confidential information
of others, or challenges to the validity of our intellectual property rights, could, in each case, impair our
ability to innovate, develop, distribute and sell our current and planned products and services, which
could materially impact our operations. In addition, even claims of infringement, misuse or
misappropriation that ultimately are unsuccessful could cause reputational harm, result in litigation
costs and divert management’s time and other resources, any of which could materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We and the Be Group offer products and solutions which may compete with each other._**

The Be Group provides business consulting, information technology and digital business services
mainly to major financial and insurance institutions in Europe, many of which are already key customers
of our Finance industry vertical. See “Business—The Be Group” for further details. While, following
completion of the Be Acquisition, we aim to benefit from cross-selling opportunities and enhance our
position in the markets served by our Finance industry vertical, to the extent that the solutions,
consulting services or products currently offered by the Be Group overlap with products and solutions
part of our Finance industry vertical portfolio, these might compete with each other for the same
customers. In addition, given that a large portion of Be Group’s revenues is generated from the same
subset of customers targeted by our Finance industry vertical, there might be a risk of revenue
cannibalization. While we expect that potential cannibalization will not be material, to the extent that
sales of certain of Be Group’s products and solutions result in decreased sales generated from our
Finance industry vertical, our growth may be adversely affected, and our overall revenues and Adjusted
EBITDA levels may be impacted, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our sales efforts require substantial resources._**

Our sales efforts typically involve educating our prospective customers about the uses, benefits and
value proposition of the systems and applications that our products support. Customers often view these
commitments as significant strategic decisions and, as a result, may require time to evaluate, test and
qualify our solutions prior to entering into or expanding a relationship with us. Our sales force develops
relationships directly with our customers, focusing on account penetration, account coordination, sales
and overall market development. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts and there
can be no assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. Purchases of digital platforms are frequently
subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other
delays. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed and when revenue
from such sale will be recognized. In addition, sales to larger customers as opposed to smaller customers
may increase the amount of time and resources spent on our sales efforts and we may face competition


-----

from companies that may have pre-existing relationships or purchase commitments from such
customers, which could decrease our chances of being chosen by such customers. The failure of our
efforts to secure sales after investing resources in a sales process could materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees and managers could harm our business._**

We operate in a rapidly changing technological market and our success depends to a significant extent
upon our ability to identify, attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified technical personnel
and management. Our employees have specialized knowledge that is in high demand, and competition
for suitably qualified individuals with the relevant technical expertise in our industry and in the locations
in which we operate is intense and may increase as the demand for business process outsourcing services
increases. Our research and innovation operations employ a dedicated team of researchers and data
scientists who command high salaries and whose skills are in high demand from competitors. In
addition, as of December 31, 2022 we employed 254 full time employees specialized in cybersecurity,
an area which requires high sophistication and specialized training. If we are unable to identify, attract,
develop, motivate, adequately compensate and retain well-qualified and engaged personnel, or if
existing highly skilled and specialized personnel leave us and successors or adequate replacements are
not readily available, we may not be able to manage our operations effectively, which could cause us
to suffer delays in new product development, experience difficulty complying with applicable
requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our customers’ demands, which would have an adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have entered into noncompete agreements with certain of our managers and employees, such agreements may be deemed
unenforceable by competent courts and tribunals allowing our competitors to hire and contract with
such managers and employees. In addition, as a result of the intense competition for highly qualified
personnel in our industry and a sharp increase in inflation rates, we have recently experienced, and may
continue to experience, wage inflation. Accordingly, our efforts to attract, retain and develop personnel
may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability and
may harm our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees.

**_The loss of members of our senior management team could have an adverse effect on our operations._**

We believe that certain members of our senior management team are key to our business. We have put
policies and remuneration in place designed to retain and incentivize management. However, there can
be no assurance that we will be able to retain and properly incentivize management or to find suitable
replacements should any key members of our management leave us. Should members of senior
management leave in significant numbers or if a critical member of senior management were to leave
unexpectedly, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.

**_Our insurance coverage might not be sufficient and we might be subject to uninsured losses._**

We maintain insurance coverage to protect ourselves against a broad range of risks, including in relation
to property damage, data breaches, business interruptions, directors’ and officers’ liability and product
liability, at levels we believe are appropriate and consistent with current industry practice. Our contracts
with contractors also include provisions requiring such contractors to enter into suitable insurance. We
also maintain general liability insurance coverage, for damage caused by disclosure of confidential
information, system failures, errors or unsatisfactory performance of services to our customers in the
event of a third party claim citing damages or financial loss. However, we may incur losses that may be
beyond the limits, or outside the scope, of coverage of our insurance and that may limit or prevent
indemnification under our insurance policies. In addition, we might not be able to maintain adequate
insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms in the future. Further, certain categories of risks
are currently not insurable at reasonable cost, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Finally, there can be no assurance of the financial abilities
of the insurance companies to meet their claim payment obligations.


-----

**_We may face labor disruptions that could interfere with our operations, and we may be unable to_**
**_efficiently reorganize our workforce in the event of a market downturn._**

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had an average of 12,473 employees, of which 10,406 were
located in Italy. As a result, we are subject to a number of collective bargaining agreements (“CCNL”)
in Italy. In general, the CCNLs include terms that regulate remuneration, minimum salary, salary
complements, extra time, benefits, bonuses and partial disability. Our employees in Italy are subject to
various CCNLs including, among the others, the CCNL for employees in the mechanical engineering
sector, the CCNL for employees in the trade companies sector, the CCNL for employees in the
telecommunications sector and the CCNL for executives in the industrial sector. Trade unions and work
councils exist at many of our premises, and several hundred of our employees are enrolled in one or the
other. While we believe that we have good relations with unions and employees generally, we also
proactively manage our employee base, facilitating turnover from time to time. There can be no
assurance that our relations will not deteriorate (including as a result any such or similar measures) and
that we will not experience labor disputes in the future. Any failure to extend or renegotiate our
collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us, or at all, could have a material adverse effect
on our business. Additionally, the right to go on strike is provided for under Italian law, and we have
historically experienced occasional labor action and cannot guarantee that our employees will not go
on strike in the future, which if they occurred, could, for example, hinder our ability to provide our
ordinary level of customer service, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately
1.2% of our employees, according to management estimates, participated in five nationwide labor
strikes. Furthermore, in the event that we experience a significant or otherwise material increase in labor
costs that we are not able to otherwise relocate within our structure and/or a deterioration in our
relationship with our employees, any such event could result in a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We are subject to risks associated with operating in several different jurisdictions, including risks_**
**_relating to the fluctuations of exchange rates._**

Following completion of the Be Acquisition, we serve our customers through operations covering 20
countries worldwide including major European countries (such as Belgium, France, Germany, Spain,
Switzerland and the United Kingdom), the United States and Latin American countries, such as Brazil.
Our operations in these countries are subject to the local legal, political and economic environments.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 18.3% of our revenues outside of Italy. Moreover,
following the completion of the Be Acquisition, we strengthened our international operations, as we
offer Be Group’s products and services in three additional new countries (Poland, Romania and
Albania), and increased our presence in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Our operations are subject
to local regulations including, among others, employment, tax, reporting and trade regulations. We may
not be in compliance with all regulations in the countries in which we operate and may be subject to
penalties and/or fines as a result. Additionally, political deadlock, economic crises and sovereign debt
crises could affect our countries of operations other than Italy. Moreover, in certain countries in which
we operate, political, security and economic changes may result in political and regulatory uncertainty
and civil unrest. Furthermore, some of the countries in which we operate are emerging economies and
as such are more susceptible to adverse global economic trends and higher inflationary pressure, which
could have a negative effect on the growth of our business or operations, increase our operating costs
or decrease consumer demand and spending power.

Each of these factors could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our
business, reputation, financial conditions or result of operations.

Additionally, currency risk arises in connection with the translation of the financial condition and results
of operations of our international subsidiaries with non-euro reporting currencies. Any of these factors
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

Because we operate in several countries worldwide, a significant portion of our sales, expenses, assets
and liabilities are recorded in currencies other than the euro, our reporting currency, and are exposed to
the foreign exchange risk deriving from the different currencies in which we operate, including foreign
exchange translation and transaction risks. Our primary foreign exchange rate risks relate to the U.S.
dollar and the Brazilian real and, for the year ended December 31, 2022, less than 6.8% of our revenues
were generated in Brazil and the United States, and 10.1% of our revenues were generated in currencies
other than the Euro. While we believe our net exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates is not
significant, our results are subject to foreign exchange translation and transaction risks. Transactional
risk arises when we and our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than our functional
currency. To the extent that we incur expenses in one currency but generate sales in another, any change
in the values of those non-euro currencies relative to euro could cause our profits to decrease or our
services and solutions to be less competitive than those of our competitors. To the extent that cash and
receivables that are denominated in currencies other than the euro are greater or less than our liabilities
denominated in such non-euro currencies, we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations and movements
in the foreign exchange markets. Where we are unable to match revenues and receivables denominated
in foreign currencies with expenses and liabilities denominated in the same currency, our results of
operations are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations.

**_We are subject to complex tax laws, and changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax positions could_**
**_adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition._**

Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax
payments. We often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations.
We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these
laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes
could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the cost of our services
to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations or our effective tax rate
and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. The occurrence
of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Changes to accounting standards may affect our reporting of our financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

Our financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. Any changes in these
accounting standards may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results from
operations. Furthermore, our assumptions, estimates and judgments related to complex accounting
matters could significantly affect our financial results. IFRS and related accounting pronouncements,
implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant
to our business, including, but not limited to, impairment of assets, leases terms, purchase price
allocation, deferred tax assets, receivable from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and fair value of options on noncontrolling interest are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and
judgments by us. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions,
estimates or judgments by us could require us to make changes to our accounting systems to implement
these changes that could increase our operating costs, and could significantly change our reported or
expected financial performance.

**_A substantial portion of our assets are represented by goodwill, trademarks and other intangible_**
**_assets, and we may never realize the full value thereof or we may be required to write down the value_**
**_of our goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets._**

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets. As of
December 31, 2022, our total goodwill, which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the
net assets of the businesses we acquire, was €1,270.6 million, or 38.7% of our total assets, which mainly
relates to the Engineering Acquisition and the Be Acquisition, and the value of our trademarks, which


-----

mainly relates to the Engineering brand, was €515.7 million. We perform goodwill, trademark and other
intangible assets impairment testing on an annual basis, and we did not incur impairment losses on
goodwill, trademark and other intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2022 and in the years
ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill,
trademark or other intangible assets is necessary, we would have to record the appropriate charge, which
could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A write-down of our goodwill,
trademark or other intangible assets may result from, amongst other things, deterioration in our
performance or a decline in expected future cash flows. As of December 31, 2022 we had €58.5 million
of deferred tax liabilities, €5.1 million of which related to the value of our trademark, €15.1 million of
which mainly related to grants which have to be collected but taxable in five years, and €22.4 million
of which related to the allocation of the goodwill of companies that have been consolidated into the
Group. No impact on cash flow and no risk with respect to each deferred taxes.

**_Certain of our subsidiaries have non-controlling shareholders whose interests may differ from ours._**
**_In addition, the contractual arrangements with such non-controlling shareholders may require us to_**
**_purchase shares at predetermined prices under certain put and call options and to make payments_**
**_under certain earn-out arrangements._**

We operate a number of our businesses through strategic partnerships with other investors who hold a
non-controlling interest in the relevant business. Our relationships with these strategic partners are
governed by various contractual arrangements, which regulate, inter alia, the corporate governance,
management and administration of such businesses. In certain circumstances, certain material decisions
regarding such subsidiaries’ operations, such as capital increases, relocation of corporate domicile and
other relevant matters, require the consent of non-controlling shareholders. In selected cases, we have
also undertaken to make yearly dividend distributions. Our strategic partners may not necessarily share
our views on the manner in which the relevant business should operate and may exercise their rights in
a manner which is adverse to us, which, in turn, may adversely affect our business. Moreover, if we are
unable to resolve such conflicts of interest or disputes with strategic partners in an amicable way, we
may be required to initiate legal proceedings, which would require us to incur significant costs and
expose us to substantially uncertain outcomes. As a result, any disputes with our strategic partners could
cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
the contractual arrangements with such non-controlling shareholders may require us to purchase shares
at predetermined prices under certain put and call options and to make payments under certain earn out
arrangements. Our overall liability with respect to such put and call options relating to non-controlling
holdings of certain Group companies (the “Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of
Subsidiaries”) is accounted for as other non-current liabilities in our audited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, and amounted to €2.6 million (on a
discounted basis), in addition to €14.9 million in respect of earn-out liabilities. Moreover, as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2022, Be’s overall liability with respect to put and call options amounted
to €13.5 million (on a discounted basis). The Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of
Subsidiaries reflect our estimate of discounted future disbursements in connection with such options,
based on the applicable contractual provisions. The value of the Contingent Liabilities to NonControlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries is subject to change over time as the exercise price of each put
and call option and earn out arrangement is dependent on, among other things, the performance of the
relevant company in a given future period, which could differ from the performance that we estimate
when determining the Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries for
accounting purposes. If the value of the Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of
Subsidiaries changes, the change is accounted for in our income statement as finance income (if the
value of the Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries decreases) or
finance expense (if the value of the Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of
Subsidiaries increases). If we underestimate the value of the Contingent Liabilities to Non-Controlling
Shareholders of Subsidiaries for any reasons, our financial liabilities would be higher than the ones
reported in our consolidated financial statements and the cash amounts we would be required to pay our
strategic partners would be higher than expected. If we are required to make any such payments, our
liquidity position would be adversely affected. In addition, we may not have available cash on our


-----

balance sheet to acquire the relevant non-controlling interests at the time we are contractually required
to do so and we may otherwise be unable to obtain financing at favorable terms and conditions or at all.
If we do not comply with our contractual obligations to purchase non-controlling interests, we may
become subject to legal proceedings and incur substantial costs and expenses, which, in turn, may have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our operating results may fluctuate from one quarter to the next due to various factors, including_**
**_revenue generation, cash collection and billing patterns._**

Our operating results may differ significantly from quarter to quarter and our business may be affected
by several factors including the timing between the receipt of purchase orders from our customers, the
date of a new contract is entered into and the beginning of the provision of the services or of the launch
of new products and services, the termination of existing contracts, the loss of existing customers,
variations in the volume of business from customers resulting from changes in our customers’
operations or the onset of certain times of the year, the business decisions of our customers regarding
the use of our services, start-up costs, delays or difficulties in expanding our operational facilities and
infrastructure, changes to our revenues mix or to our pricing structure or that of our competitors,
inaccurate estimates of resources and time required to complete ongoing projects, longer customer
payment cycles, currency fluctuation, seasonal changes in the operations of our customers and external
circumstances, including pandemics and other catastrophic events.

Typically, while our cash collection is stable during the first two quarters of each year on the back of
the ongoing fees we receive by customers under all our ongoing contracts, our cash collection usually
peaks during the fourth quarter of each year due to the finalization of accounts and payment of invoices
by our customers in anticipation of the end of the financial year. Our cash collection is typically lowest
during the third quarter of each year due primarily to extended school holidays in Italy during the month
of August. Our billing cycle and the recognition of revenues in our income statement is typically subject
to similar seasonal drivers, with a stable level of revenues recorded in the first two quarters of each
year, when we collect purchase orders from customers, and the highest revenues recorded during the
third and fourth quarter of each year when we typically issue invoices to our customers in connection
with the formalization of purchase orders as binding contracts and the finalization of our yearly
accounts. These drivers cause differences in our revenues among the various quarters of any financial
year, which means that the individual quarters of a year may not be directly compared with each other
or used to predict annual financial results. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial_
_Condition—Revenue generation, cash collection and billing patterns.”_

In addition, the sales cycles across our industry verticals is typically long, with the time between the
receipt of purchase orders, the date a contract is entered into and the beginning of the provision of
services ranging from an average of six months for private sector customers to one to two years for
contracts awarded under public tenders. Customers may terminate their contracts prior to execution
thereof, in which case the costs we incurred prior to termination might not be entirely recoverable, if at
all. Moreover, the internal budget and approval processes of our prospective customers make it difficult
to predict the timing of new client engagements. Also, since we recognize revenues only upon actual
provision of the contracted services and when the criteria for recognition are achieved in accordance
with IFRS, the financial benefit of gaining a new client may not be realized at the intended time due to
delays in the implementation of our services or to an increase in the start-up costs required in building
our infrastructure. Any of these factors, individually or in the aggregate, may make it difficult for us to
prepare accurate internal financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenues that are not realized as a
result of these delays, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Furthermore, historically, from time to time, to even out our cash generation cycle and to manage our
working capital and other liquidity needs, we engaged in the sale of receivables, also through spot sales
of receivables. Currently, we primarily rely on our operating cash flow and on sales of receivables under


-----

our Intesa Securitization Programs and on a spot basis, as well as our Existing Revolving Credit Facility
to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity needs, as a result of which seasonal fluctuation in our
cash balance may be more extensive.

**_We may be unable to obtain the bid bonds, performance bonds, securities or guarantees we need to_**
**_compete in certain public tenders or to enter into certain contracts with our private customers, and_**
**_due to our failure to perform our obligations, counterparties may enforce bid and performance bonds_**
**_we have posted._**

From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business and, in particular, in order to be able to
participate in competitive tenders, enter into contracts with certain customers, particularly those in our
Public Administration industry vertical, or receive advances on the payments under contracts with them,
we are required to provide customers with bank guarantees and/or insurance bonds (including
commitments relating our participation in public tenders (so called “bid bonds”), advance payment,
performance or guarantee bonds). Our ability to obtain such bonds and guarantees from lenders such as
banks, financial intermediaries and/or insurance companies depends on several factors, including such
lenders’ assessment of our overall financial condition, and of the financial condition of any of the
companies in our Group that are involved, and of the risks of the service to be provided, as well as such
company’s financial and reputational track record, also in terms of previous enforcement of
performance bonds and guarantees. If we are unable to obtain new bonds and guarantees, if we
renegotiate existing bonds and guarantees on less favorable economic terms, or if we are required to
pay penalties in the event that we default on our obligations, our ability to obtain new commissions or
enter into new contracts could be impaired or become significantly more costly, which could all have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

In the ordinary course of our business, we provide certain guarantees with respect to, among others, our
participation in tender offers. Such guarantees amounted to €414.7* million and €499.4 million as of
December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We also provided performance bonds and
bid bonds in an amount of €79.6* million and €79.1 million as of December 31, 2021 and December
31, 2022, respectively. In addition, we also provide bank sureties in favor of other companies, in an
amount of €9.5* million a €11.1 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022. Some of
these bonds and guarantees include cross-default provisions which could be triggered if we default
under other bonds and guarantees, which could amplify the impact of a default under these instruments.
If our customers were to enforce the bonds, including as a result of our default or alleged default under
any applicable terms and conditions, laws or regulations, we were required to post at the time of the
relevant contract or tender, we could be subject to payment obligations, individually or in the aggregate,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects. For example, in 2020 CONSIP enforced a bid bond posted by the Company, following the
annulment of the award to the Company of a contract for the management and development of
information systems for the Italian administrative justice system. See “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.”_

**_Our liabilities in relation to post-employment benefits are significant and we may be unable to_**
**_continue funding such post-employment benefits into the future._**

Our obligations with respect to post-employment benefits are substantial and, amounted to €79.5
million, €71.6 million and €72.0* million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Be’s obligations with respect to post-employment benefits amounted to €8.0* million and
€7.1* million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Valuations of the liabilities of our postemployment benefits are based on certain actuarial assumptions, which include, for example,
discounting factors, demographic trends, life expectancy, pension trends, future salary trends and
expected returns on assets. If any of these assumptions are revised, additional contributions may need
to be made to the funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity
and results of operations. There can be no assurance that that in the longer term we would be able to
fund the aforementioned post-employment benefits if required to do so on an immediate buy-out basis


-----

or at a more accelerated rate than our current funding obligations. If the market value of the fund assets
declines or if the value of the assessed liabilities increases, we may be required to increase our
contributions and this may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results
of operations.

**Risks Related to the Be Acquisition**

**_The Golden Power Legislation will continue to be applicable to MergerCo and the entity resulting_**
**_from the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger._**

The Engineering Acquisition was authorized by the Presidency of the Italian Council of Ministers
(Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri) under the Golden Power Legislation. Prior to the First Be
Acquisition Closing Date, we obtained the corresponding authorization, subject to the fulfillment of
certain prescriptive measures. However, the Golden Power Legislation (including the relevant
clearances regime) will continue to be applicable to the Company, Be and Overlord Bidco, in case the
relevant entity (including its controlling company or subsidiaries) is involved in any transaction, act or
resolution falling within the scope of the Golden Power Legislation, including, among others, any
transfers (direct or indirect) of the Company and Be and/or the Company’s and Be’s shares or assets (in
whole or in part), including upon enforcement of any pledges on the shares or assets of the Issuer, the
Company, Be and Overlord Bidco, and/or any other transactions triggering a change of control of the
Issuer, the Company, Be and Overlord Bidco. In addition, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian
courts whether, under the Golden Power Legislation, the granting of pledges on the shares or assets of
Issuer, the Company, Be and Overlord Bidco, any transfer and/or assignment of the rights of the secured
creditors to other secured creditors as well as any extension of the pledges on the shares or assets of the
Issuer, the Company, Be and Overlord Bidco in favor of new secured creditors, or the granting of
security over certain assets of the Issuer, the Company, Be or Overlord Bidco, would require a specific
clearance in Italy under the Golden Power Legislation. On the other hand, any transfers (direct or
indirect) of the shares or assets (in whole or in part) of the above-mentioned entities, including upon
enforcement of any pledges on the shares or assets of the Issuer, the Company, Be or Overlord Bidco,
and the actual transfer, upon the occurrence of certain events of defaults or declared defaults (as the
case may be), to the relevant secured creditors of the voting and administrative rights, will be subject
to the Golden Power Legislation.

The Engineering Merger was authorized by the Presidency of the Italian Council of Ministers
(Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri) under the Golden Power Legislation on April 21, 2023.
Moreover, pursuant to the Golden Power Legislation, the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, among
others, is also subject to a new filing with the Presidency of the Italian Council of Ministers, albeit
obtaining the relevant clearances is subject to a simplified procedure because it is an extraordinary
transaction implemented by companies belonging to the same Group. Following the Engineering
Merger and the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, the Golden Power Legislation (including the
relevant clearances regime), will continue to be applicable to MergerCo and the entity resulting from
the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger in case the relevant entity (including its controlling company
or subsidiaries) is involved in any transaction, act or resolution falling within the scope of the Golden
Power Legislation and not having already been notified to the Presidency of the Italian Council of
Ministers (Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri) under the Golden Power Legislation, including,
among others, any transfers (direct or indirect) of MergerCo and the entity resulting from the
Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger and/or such entities’ shares or assets (in whole or in part),
including upon enforcement of the pledges on the shares or assets of MergerCo and the entity resulting
from the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, and/or any other transactions triggering a change of
control of MergerCo and the entity resulting from the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger. In addition,
it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Golden Power Legislation, the granting
or confirmation of the pledges over the shares or assets of MergerCo and the entity resulting from the
Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, any transfer and/or assignment of the rights of the secured
creditors to other secured creditors as well as any extension of such pledges, in favor of new secured
creditors, require a specific clearance in Italy under the Golden Power Legislation.


-----

Finally, failure to comply with the reporting obligation provided under the Italian Golden Power
Legislation or with any veto or undertakings imposed by the the Presidency of the Italian Council of
Ministers (Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri) may result in the relevant transaction, act or resolution
being unwound or declared null and void, and in the perpetrators being subject to material monetary
fines.

**_The Be Group may have liabilities that are not known to us or greater than anticipated, and any_**
**_indemnities under the Be Acquisition Agreement or other agreements may be insufficient, and the_**
**_Be Acquisition may have entitled certain commercial counterparties to terminate their agreements_**
**_with Be._**

The Be Group may have liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing
due diligence investigations in connection with the Be Acquisition. We may learn of additional
information about the Be Group that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities or
issues relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations or other matters. For example, we
could become liable for overdue payables of the Be Group to suppliers and employees that are not
currently known to us, or we could become subject to tax or pension liabilities in respect of historical
periods that we are not currently aware of or the amount of which we underestimated or be subject to
or impacted by the consequences of acts of malfeasance of compliance violations carried out by the Be
Group. In connection with the entry into the Be Acquisition Agreement and completion of the Initial
Acquisition, by virtue of the fact that Be was a publicly listed company, we relied primarily on
information of Be which was publicly available. There can be no assurance that such information
revealed or highlighted all relevant facts necessary or helpful in evaluating the Be Acquisition.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the information of Be that was publicly available was
accurate. If we failed to identify material information regarding the Be Acquisition, Be may later be
forced to write down or write off certain assets, significantly modify the business plan, or incur
impairment or other charges. Similarly, the materialization of certain risks, which may or may not be
identified during due diligence, may lead to a loss of property, loss of value and, potentially, subsequent
contractual and statutory liability to various parties, or, in the case of compliance violations, could result
in us being restricted from participations in public tenders.

In addition, the Be Acquisition may have constituted a change of control under certain agreements
entered into by Be or its subsidiaries and certain commercial counterparties, and, following the First Be
Acquisition Closing Date, these counterparties may have become entitled to terminate such agreements.
Some of these counterparties may exercise their termination rights, which could have an adverse effect
on the revenues and business of Be. Any termination or amendment of a significant contract as a result
of the change of control could materially or adversely affect our business, undermine the integration
process of Be into our business and the ability to provide services to Be’s customers.

Any of these events, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, the financial condition and results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under
the Notes.

**_We may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the representations and warranties that_**
**_the Sellers have provided to the Company under the Be Acquisition Agreement and our ability to_**
**_recover losses suffered as a result of such a breach may be limited._**

In connection with the Be Acquisition, the Sellers have given certain representations and warranties
and indemnities in the Be Acquisition Agreement related to their shares of Be and limited businesses
representation and warranties and indemnities related to Be and the Be Group’s business, as well as a
special indemnity related to any taxes that will be paid by Be and/or any of its subsidiaries to the
competent authorities in connection with certain voluntary disclosures, settlement procedures, voluntary
correction of tax returns (“ravvedimento operoso”), audits or assessments. Nonetheless, third-parties
could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities the Sellers have agreed to retain, and we may
not be able to enforce any claims against the Sellers relating to breaches of these representations and


-----

warranties. The Sellers’ liability under the Be Acquisition Agreement is very limited. Moreover, even
if we are able to eventually recover any losses resulting from a breach of these representations and
warranties, we may temporarily be required to bear these losses ourselves. In addition, if any of the
Sellers becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result
of the Sellers’ breach may be limited by the liquidity of the other Sellers or the applicable laws
governing the bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of such breach, we could incur losses, which could
adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_The Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger will result in the release of certain security interests and_**
**_Be or the resulting entity of the Be-Be Opco Merger will not grant security or a Notes Guarantee in_**
**_favor of the Notes._**

Upon completion of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, Overlord Bidco will no longer be a
separate legal entity, and will therefore no longer be a Guarantor. In addition, the Overlord Funding
Loan II, and any security interest granted in respect of it, will cease to exist. The pledge on the shares
of Overlord Bidco held by the Company (or MergerCo, following the Engineering Merger) will also
cease to exist as a result of such merger, and although the Notes will instead be secured by a pledge to
be granted within 10 Business Days of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger on all the shares of Be
or the entity resulting from the Be-Be Opco Merger (as the case may be) held by the Company (or
MergerCo, following the Engineering Merger), none of Be, the entity resulting from the Be-Be Opco
Mergers or any subsidiary thereof is expected to grant a Notes Guarantee of the Notes or provide any
security or other credit support in favor of the Notes.

**Risks Related to Our Capital Structure**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business,_**
**_financial position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under_**
**_the Notes and the Guarantees._**

As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service
obligations. As of December 31, 2022, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, we would have had
total third-party financial indebtedness outstanding in the amount of €1,175.1 million, including €385.0
million representing the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby, €605.0 million
representing the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes, €50.0 million of outstanding debt
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, €38.4 million representing the aggregate principal amount
of our Existing Term Loan, and €96.7 million of other Company indebtedness (including €53.9 million
of Be’s indebtedness). In addition, on or about September 19, 2022, certain lenders made available an
additional facility under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an aggregate principal
amount of €35.0 million by way of a fungible increase of the total commitments under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility to €195.0 million. We anticipate that we will continue to be highly leveraged
for the foreseeable future, including after completion of the Transactions. See “Capitalization,”
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.”

The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Transactions could have
important consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes, the Existing
Notes, the Existing Term Loan, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and other debt and
liabilities we may incur;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the
payments in respect of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to


-----

fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and
development, or other general corporate purposes;

- restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors; and

- limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital
expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and
increasing the cost of any future borrowings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our obligations, including under the Notes. Although the terms of the Indenture limit our ability
to incur additional indebtedness, such limitations are subject to exceptions and qualifications and the
incurrence of additional indebtedness would exacerbate the risks above.

Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected
by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Many of these
factors are beyond our control. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet our other obligations
and commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for
such purpose. We cannot assure you that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely
basis or satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments.

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and prior to_**
**_the Engineering Merger will depend exclusively on cash from the operating companies of the Group_**
**_to be able to make payments on the Notes._**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer is (and until the Engineering Merger, if any,
will continue to be) a holding company that conducts no business operations of its own and has no
significant assets other than the shares it holds in the Company and its receivables under the Existing
Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loan I. The Issuer is, and following the Engineering Merger,
MergerCo will in part be (as we expect that MergerCo will generate the majority of the Group’s cash
flows and profits), dependent upon the cash flows from its operating subsidiaries in the form of
dividends, principal repayments under (prior to the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger) the Overlord
Funding Loan II and, prior to completion of the Engineering Merger, the Existing Funding Loan and
the Overlord Funding Loan I, or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its
obligations under the Notes. See “—The Issuer’s right to receive payments under the Existing Funding
_Loan and the Overlord Funding Loan I prior to the Engineering Merger (if it occurs) may be_
_subordinated by law to the obligations of other creditors, and the Overlord Funding Loan II is expected_
_to be eliminated in connection with the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger.” The amounts of_
dividends and distributions available to the Issuer depends, and following the Engineering Merger the
amounts of dividends and distributions available to MergerCo will in part depend, on the profitability
and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under
applicable law or otherwise transfer funds directly or indirectly to the Issuer or MergerCo, as applicable.
Furthermore, a portion of the Company’s distributable profits and available reserves was set aside
pursuant to the Whitewash Procedure that was completed on March 28, 2022, to enable the Company
to guarantee the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan. Therefore, that portion of distributable
profits and available reserves that was set aside pursuant to the Whitewash Procedure cannot be used to
make distributions to the Issuer until effectiveness of the Engineering Merger and the Company may
not have distributable profits and available reserves in order to make distributions to the Issuer. See also
“—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Once granted, the Guarantees and
_the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_
_laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Certain_


-----

_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and the Security Interests.”_

More generally, the Issuer’s or, following the Engineering Merger, MergerCo’s, subsidiaries may not
be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream
loans to the Issuer or to MergerCo, as applicable, which could adversely affect the Issuer’s (or,
following the Engineering Merger, MergerCo’s) ability to make payments in respect of its indebtedness,
including payments in respect of the Notes. In particular, various agreements governing our debt may
restrict and, in some cases may prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash to the Issuer and,
following the Engineering Merger, to MergerCo. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments
to further taxation. Applicable laws may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be
permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or prevent such payments. In
particular, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries or, following the Engineering Merger, MergerCo’s
subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer or to MergerCo, as applicable, will generally be limited to
the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their debt when
due. In addition, the aggregate amount of the Existing Funding Loan is approximately €114.4 million,
which is significantly lower than the aggregate principal amounts of the Existing Notes, and interest on
the Existing Funding Loan accrues at a rate equal to the three month EURIBOR plus 5.50% per annum.
The principal amount under each of the Overlord Funding Loans is €385 million, all of which is
outstanding as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Interest on each of the Overlord Funding
Loans accrues at a rate equal to the three month EURIBOR plus 8.75% per annum. Prior to the
Engineering Merger, the ability of the Issuer to make payments under the Existing Notes and the Notes
offered hereby will largely depend on the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to it, which
is subject to the risks described above and could be inefficient from a tax perspective, as well as on the
ability of Overlord Bidco and the Company to pay and/or repay amounts due under the Overlord
Funding Loans. Following the Engineering Merger the above-mentioned risks will apply to MergerCo.

Following the Engineering Merger, none of the subsidiaries of MergerCo other than Overlord Bidco is
expected to guarantee the Notes. Upon completion of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger,
Overlord Bidco will no longer be a separate legal entity, and will therefore no longer be a Guarantor.
In addition, the Overlord Funding Loan II, and any security interest granted in respect of it, will cease
to exist. The pledge on the shares of Overlord Bidco held by the Company (or MergerCo, following the
Engineering Merger) will also cease to exist as a result of such merger, and although the Notes will
instead be secured by a pledge to be granted within 10 Business Days of the Engineering-Overlord
Bidco Merger on all the shares of Be or the entity resulting from the Be-Be Opco Merger (as the case
may be) held by the Company (or MergerCo, following the Engineering Merger), none of Be, the entity
resulting from the Be-Be Opco Mergers or any subsidiary thereof is expected to grant a Notes Guarantee
of the Notes or provide any security or other credit support in favor of the Notes. While we expect that,
following the Engineering Merger, MergerCo will generate the majority of the Group’s cash flows and
profits, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes and, following the Engineering
Merger, all of the subsidiaries of MergerCo other than Overlord Bidco for so long as it remains a
Guarantor, will have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes, and, accordingly,
the Issuer or MergerCo, as applicable, will also rely on the ability of its respective subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other intercompany payments to it in order to be able to service the Notes. While the
Indenture limits the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries or, following the Engineering Merger,
MergerCo’s subsidiaries, to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other
intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions,
including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our_**
**_debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

Despite our substantial leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Following
completion of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Increase, we are able to borrow up to €195.0
million under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, which is secured by the same collateral as the


-----

Collateral for the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan. In addition, the Indenture and
the Existing Indenture also permit the incurrence of additional debt. The Indenture, the Existing
Indenture, the Existing Term Loan Agreement and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
also permit us to incur a substantial amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the
Notes and to incur indebtedness that shares in the Collateral or that benefits from security interests over
assets that do not secure the Notes, and any such indebtedness could mature prior to the Notes. Although
the Indenture, the Existing Indenture, the Existing Term Loan and the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions
are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the amount of indebtedness
that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions is substantial. If additional debt is incurred,
the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Indenture, the Existing Indenture, the
Existing Term Loan and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement do not prevent us from
incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Our inability to
service our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of
operations and our ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility._**

The Indenture, the Existing Indenture, the Existing Term Loan Agreement and the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement contain covenants which impose significant operating and financial
restrictions on us. These agreements limit our ability to, among other things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

- make certain restricted payments and investments;

- transfer or sell assets;

- enter into transactions with affiliates;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

- issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

- create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other
payments to us;

- take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral;

- merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

- pay or redeem subordinated debt or repurchase equity.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of
_the Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to operate_
our business, to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities
and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with certain
affirmative covenants while the Existing Revolving Credit Facility remains outstanding. Furthermore,
under certain circumstances, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply
with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Revolving
_Credit Facility Agreement.” Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the Existing Revolving Credit_
Facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet such


-----

financial ratio. While failure to satisfy the financial ratio shall not directly or indirectly constitute, or
result in a default or event of default, it would result in a draw stop for any new utilizations under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility thereby potentially adversely impacting our liquidity. Subject to the
foregoing, a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement could, subject to the applicable cure period, result in an event of default under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is continuing
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement the relevant creditors are entitled to cancel the
availability of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and/or elect to declare all amounts outstanding
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, immediately due and
payable. In addition, a default, event of default and/or acceleration action under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that
contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions, including (in the case of acceleration of
obligations under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility) the Indenture, the Existing Indenture and the
Existing Term Loan. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility, the Existing Indenture and the Existing Term Loan, accelerate the payment of those amounts,
we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in
full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and
to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts,
our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We may be unable to raise the financing that we require or refinance our existing debt, including the_**
**_Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan, each of which_**
**_will mature prior to the Notes._**

Certain of our debt matures prior to the Notes. For example, the Existing Notes will mature on
September 30, 2026, which is prior to the maturity date of the Notes offered hereby. Likewise, the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility will mature three months prior to the maturity of the Existing Notes
and the Existing Term Loan will mature on the earlier to occur of (a) January 22, 2027 and (b) the
maturity date of the Existing Notes. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or
obtain such refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to sell assets, or raise additional
debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial or holders of our debt may accelerate our
debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. If the Issuer and its subsidiaries are
not able to refinance any of their debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially
reasonable terms or at all, the Issuer may not be able to satisfy its obligations with respect to its debt,
including the Notes. Any delay in refinancing, or the inability to refinance on commercially acceptable
terms, debt falling due in accordance with the maturity schedule of our indebtedness may result in an
acceleration of such debt, and enforcement over our assets, including in particular any collateral granted
as security in support of such debt, including our properties. In addition, the refinancing of existing debt
may be on different terms than our current ones, among other things, could drive an increase in debt
service costs, thereby restricting our degree of flexibility. If we are unable to refinance our debt when
due, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, while the Existing PIK
Notes issued by Topco mature after the Notes, it may prove difficult to refinance or redeem the Notes
or the Existing Notes without at the same time repaying or redeeming the Existing PIK Notes. For
details of the maturity profile of our debt, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which_**
**_we may not be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Term Loan, the Existing Notes and our obligations under the
Notes, or to refinance our debt and to fund our ongoing operations or expansion plans, will depend on
our future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to the success
of our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory
and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond
our control.


-----

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that
currently anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing
will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the
Notes, the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan, or to fund our other liquidity needs including
the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.
At the maturity of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility (which is three months prior to the maturity
of the Existing Notes), the Existing Notes (which is September 30, 2026), the Notes (which will mature
after all of our other material outstanding debt) or any other debt that we may incur, we may be required
to refinance or restructure our indebtedness if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and
other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We intend to
use the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, among others, for liquidity and working capital purposes,
and if we are unable to refinance or extend the Existing Revolving Credit Facility in the future or if we
are unable to procure a replacement liquidity line for working capital and other purposes, our financial
condition may be adversely affected and our ability to implement our business strategy may be
impaired.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our
obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Existing Notes and the Notes,
on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising
transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We
cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. If this is the case, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or
all of our debt.

Any failure to make payments on the Notes or the Existing Notes on a timely basis would likely result
in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.
In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Indenture, the Existing Notes, the Existing
Indenture, the Existing Term Loan and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, will limit, and any future
debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at
higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further
restrict our business, financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any
assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and
the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of
these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations, which could cause an event of
default under our debt and result in:

- our debt holders declaring all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;

- the lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the lender under the
Existing Term Loan Agreement being able to terminate their commitments to lend us money
and foreclose against the assets securing our borrowings; and

- our being forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in you losing your
investment in the Notes.

**_Amounts borrowed under the Existing Term Loan and drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit_**
**_Facility bear, and any future variable interest rate debt we incur in the future will bear interest at_**
**_floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**


-----

A large portion of our debt, including amounts borrowed under the Existing Term Loan and drawings
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, bear interest at a variable rate. After giving effect to the
Transactions, the portion of our debt that will bear interest at a variable rate and our exposure to the risk
of fluctuations in interest rates will increase. The Existing Term Loan bears a variable rate based on the
EURIBOR plus an applicable margin, and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility bears a variable rate
based on the EURIBOR, in each case plus an applicable margin. The material increases in global
inflation since early 2022, reaching double-digit levels not seen since the 1980s, and expectations that
annual inflation may remain high for a long period of time (driven at least in part by Russia’s invasion
of Ukraine and the resulting impact on energy markets) has forced central banks of the major world
economies, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, to significantly increase
market interest rates in a very short timeframe, ending the lengthy period of low interest rates, which
has adversely affected our financing costs. The interest rates under our floating rate financing
arrangements could continue to rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense
associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering
our ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither the Indenture, the Existing Indenture, the Existing
Term Loan Agreement nor the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains a covenant
requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of
these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially
reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant
amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements, that hedges might not be available for
the full amount or term of the borrowings, that break clauses might be required or that hedges will limit
any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in interest rates. To the extent
interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus
reducing cash flow.

If we determine that EURIBOR has been permanently discontinued or, at the request of the Issuer or
the agent (acting on the instructions of the majority lenders), the agent will use an alternative reference
rate in the manner as described in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Existing
Term Loan Agreement.

**_Hedging arrangements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our hedging_**
**_counterparties fall into bankruptcy._**

We may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, including under the Existing Term Loan and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. We may also
enter currency hedging arrangements in respect of our international operations and our indebtedness,
including the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. Under any such agreements, we would be exposed to
credit risks of our counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we
have under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements may become worthless. In addition, in
the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate such hedging agreements, we may be
required to make termination payments, which would result in a loss.

**Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security Interests**

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of_**
**_each of the subsidiaries of Issuer (or MergerCo, as applicable) that does not guarantee the Notes._**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws,
on the Issue Date, the Notes will be jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the
Company and Overlord Bidco. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material
limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Company also guarantees the Issuer’s obligations under the
Existing Notes, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Term Loan, and Overlord Bidco
guarantees the Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, in each case, on a
senior secured basis. The Guarantees will be subject to certain material limitations pursuant to


-----

applicable laws as described under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” Furthermore, under the_
Agreed Security Principles, no member of the Group (other than Overlord Bidco and the Company)
that may provide a guarantee under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, even after the Engineering
Merger, will be able to guarantee the Notes.

The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the existing or future liabilities of the Issuer’s subsidiaries
that are not, or do not become or cease to be, Guarantors and to the liabilities of any Guarantor to the
extent that such liabilities exceed the principal amount of Notes that can be guaranteed or secured by
the Company and Overlord Bidco. The Guarantees by the Company and Overlord Bidco, and any other
future Guarantees, will provide the holders of the Notes with direct claims against the Company,
Overlord Bidco or the other relevant Guarantor, as applicable. However, the obligations of any
Guarantor of the Notes under its Guarantee will be limited under the Indenture to an amount which has
been determined so as to ensure that amounts payable will not result in violations of applicable laws or
otherwise cause such Guarantor to be deemed insolvent under applicable law or such Guarantee to be
deemed void, unenforceable or ultra vires, or cause the directors of such Guarantor to be held in breach
of applicable law for providing the relevant Guarantee. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its
Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon the amount of its obligations and
upon applicable laws. The Guarantee of the Company, Overlord Bidco and of any other subsidiary
which might be required in the future to become a Guarantor under the Indenture will be limited as set
forth in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of
_the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” Upon completion of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco_
Merger, Overlord Bidco will no longer be a separate legal entity, and therefore the Overlord Funding
Loan II, and any security interest granted in respect of it, will cease to exist. The pledge on the shares
of Overlord Bidco held by the Company (or MergerCo, following the Engineering Merger) will also
cease to exist as a result of such merger, and the Notes will instead be secured by a pledge to be granted
within ten Business Days of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger on all the shares of Be or the entity
resulting from the Be-Be Opco Merger (as the case may be) held by the Company (or MergerCo,
following the Engineering Merger).

Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any)
of non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of
such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective parent entity
or the creditors of the Issuer (or after the Engineering Merger Date, MergerCo), or the relevant
Guarantor, as the case may be. Accordingly, in the event that any subsidiary of the Issuer or any
subsidiary of MergerCo following the Engineering Merger Date, other than Overlord Bidco, becomes
insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent
transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuer, MergerCo and the Guarantors, as the case may be, including the
holders of the Notes, will have no right to proceed against the assets of such non-guarantor
subsidiary; and

- creditors of such subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if
any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of
such subsidiary before the Issuer, MergerCo, or the Guarantors, as a direct or indirect
shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including
depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of
the Issuer.

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Issuer and the Guarantors, before intercompany
eliminations, accounted for 59.4% of the revenue and 55.9% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of
the Group, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had been completed on January


-----

1, 2022, and accounted for 68.1% of the consolidated total assets of the Group. As of December 31,
2022, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and the Guarantors would have had €34.5
million of third party indebtedness (other than the Notes, the Existing Notes, amounts drawn under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Term Loan), none of which was secured over assets
other than the Collateral.

In addition, the Indenture will, subject to certain limitations, permit the Issuer, the Company, Overlord
Bidco and their respective subsidiaries, including subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, to incur
substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default under the Indenture,
and such indebtedness may also be secured. The Indenture will not contain any limitation on the amount
of other liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables in the ordinary course of business that may be
incurred by non-guarantor subsidiaries.

**_We may be unable to complete the Engineering Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all._**

The Engineering Merger was resolved upon by the board of directors of the Issuer on February 22, 2023
and the board of directors of the Company on February 23, 2023 and then resolved upon by the
respective extraordinary shareholders’ meetings on March 9, 2023 promptly thereafter with relevant
filings of the required merger documents (including the merger plan, a report by the directors of the
companies involved in the Engineering Merger (relazione dell’organo amministrativo) and a report by
an independent expert appointed by the Court of Rome, assessing the sustainability of debt at the level
of MergerCo) with the competent authorities being made promptly after each relevant approval. We
currently expect to complete the Engineering Merger in the first half of 2023, with retroactive effect
(from a tax and accounting standpoint) from January 1, 2023. The Engineering Merger is being
undertaken pursuant to the provisions of Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code. Subject to certain
exceptions, the Engineering Merger can only be implemented following the expiration of 60 days after
the latest filing with the competent companies’ registry of the resolutions approving the Engineering
Merger (such latest filing having been made on March 13, 2023). Within this 60-day deadline, the
creditors of the companies involved in the Engineering Merger are entitled to challenge the Engineering
Merger. There can be no assurance that the remaining steps required for the Engineering Merger will
be taken in a timely manner, or at all. The Engineering Merger was authorized by the Presidency of the
Italian Council of Ministers (Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri) under the Golden Power Legislation
on April 21, 2023.

As a result of the consummation of the Engineering Merger, (i) the obligations of the Issuer of the Notes
will be assumed by MergerCo pursuant to the Indenture, and (ii) certain of the security under the Initial
Collateral and the Post-Issue Date Collateral will cease to exist and the Notes will be secured by the
security interests in the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral. In the event we are unable to consummate
the Engineering Merger, Centurion Bidco S.p.A. will remain as the Issuer.

**_Once granted, the Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement_**
**_and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and_**
**_enforceability._**

Once granted, any Guarantee will provide the holders of the Notes with direct claims against the
Guarantors. The obligations of the Guarantors, the enforcement of the Guarantees and the obligations
of the grantor of security and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce on the Collateral will be limited
under the Indenture to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor or
provided by the relevant grantor of security under the applicable laws of Italy, which has been
determined so as to ensure that amounts payable will not result in violations of laws related to, among
others, corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation, financial assistance or transactions under
value, or otherwise cause the relevant Guarantor or grantor of security to be deemed insolvent under
applicable law or such Guarantee or security to be deemed void, unenforceable or ultra vires, or cause
the directors of such Guarantor or grantor of security to be held in breach of applicable laws for
providing such Guarantee or security, as applicable.


-----

In particular, enforcement of any Guarantee or Collateral against the relevant Guarantor or the relevant
security grantor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases,
to limitations contained in the terms of the Guarantee or pledge or other relevant security designed to
ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantor or relevant security
grantor. These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent conveyances or transfers,
insolvency, voidable preferences, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of
share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws and regulation or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, the liability of the relevant Guarantor under its
Guarantee or of a grantor of security could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on the
amounts of its other obligations and the law applicable to it. See “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests.”_

As a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others, financial
assistance and corporate benefit (including Article 2358 and/or Article 2474, as the case may be, of the
Italian Civil Code), notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Existing
Indenture, the Existing Term Loan Agreement, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
the Intercreditor Agreement:

(i) the Guarantee and security interests granted by the each of Company and Overlord Bidco in
respect of the Notes shall not exceed at any time (and in aggregate) an amount equal to the
principal amount of the relevant Overlord Funding Loan respectively granted to it, as
outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the Guarantee and/or the relevant security interest,
in each case net of any proceeds already paid by it pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee
under the Notes and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by it;
_provided further that neither the Company nor Overlord Bidco shall be liable as a Guarantor in_
respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that it is entitled to set-off against its claims of
recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by
it under its Guarantee. For avoidance of doubt, the contractual documentation relating to the
Overlord Funding Loans contemplates, and the contractual documentation relating to the Notes
(including the Intercreditor Agreement) will contemplate certain mechanics to prevent the
double counting of the exposure of each of the Company and Overlord Bidco under the
Guarantee and security interests granted by it, such that in case of an enforcement of the
Guarantee or security interests granted by either the Company or Overlord Bidco (for purposes
of this paragraph, the “First Guarantor”) in respect of the Notes, the principal amount then
outstanding under the relevant Overlord Funding Loan shall be automatically reduced by an
amount equal to the payment made in connection with the Notes as a result of the enforcement
of the Guarantee of, or security interests granted by, the First Guarantor, with consequent
reduction of the maximum amount of the Guarantee and security interests granted by the First
Guarantor in relation to the Notes;

(ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by each of the Company and Overlord Bidco,
also in accordance with Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not
exceed 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes;

(iii) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by each of
the Company and Overlord Bidco will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in
respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed
and/or secured by it at that time;

(iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the
mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the
Italian Usury Law and Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests
(including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative
Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993), the obligations of each of the Company and Overlord


-----

Bidco under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying
as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts
compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code
and/or Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993, respectively.

In any case, the maximum amount that the Company and Overlord Bidco may be required to pay in
respect of their obligations as Guarantors under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant
security documents upon enforcement of the relevant Collateral will rateably concur and not cumulate
with the corresponding amounts due by the Company and Overlord Bidco to any guaranteed and/or
secured creditor pursuant to the Existing Notes, the Existing Term Loan Agreement, the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed
and/or secured creditors with respect to any further _pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the_
Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt,
by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantee and the security interests
granted by the Company and Overlord Bidco, the obligations of the Company and Overlord Bidco as
Guarantors and/or security providers under the Notes, the Indenture, the Existing Notes, the Existing
Indenture, the Existing Term Loan Agreement, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future _pari passu indebtedness contemplated_
under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other
transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered
without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the
proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/ or security obligations of the
Company and Overlord Bidco shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the Company and
Overlord Bidco’s credit support as described above. As a result of these principles, even if Overlord
Bidco does not guarantee the Existing Notes or the Existing Term Loan Agreement, any proceeds from
an enforcement of the Overlord Bidco’s Guarantee of the Notes by or on behalf of the holders of the
Notes will be shared with other secured creditors in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

In addition to the above, under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued
by a guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the
guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly
identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate
document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the
relevant guarantors’ assets. If such determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the
guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst
the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in
accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes
will be able to recover limited amounts under the Guarantees and relevant security. See “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and the Security Interests.”_

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_**
**_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees_**
**_and the Collateral._**

The Issuer, TopCo and the Guarantors are incorporated and organized under the laws of Italy.
Enforcement of the obligations under the Guarantees against, and/or any Collateral provided by, as
applicable, the Guarantors and/ or Collateral providers will be subject to certain defenses available to
the Issuer or the relevant guarantor or the security provider, as the case may be. These laws and defenses
may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, financial assistance, corporate
benefit, capital maintenance, preservation of share capital, liquidity maintenance, voidable preferences,
thin capitalization or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors


-----

generally, by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and
the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or
secured by the relevant Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to
the extent that the granting of such Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security
provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the
Guarantor or relevant security provider, or such Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital
maintenance, financial assistance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general
statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary guarantor or security provider to
contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. An increase in the amount of debt
that benefits from the Guarantees without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Guarantees
will dilute the value of the Guarantees to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Notes.

Accordingly, enforcement of any Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to certain
defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the
relevant Guarantee designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant
Guarantor. As a result, the Guarantors’ liability under its Guarantees could be materially reduced or
eliminated, depending upon the law applicable to it.

It is possible that the Guarantors or creditors of the Guarantors, or the appointed bankruptcy trustee or
judicial liquidation receiver in the case of a bankruptcy, insolvency and/or judicial liquidation (as
applicable) of the Guarantors, may contest the validity and enforceability of any Guarantors’ Guarantee
on any of the above grounds and the applicable court may determine that such Guarantee should be
limited or voided. To the extent that agreed limitations on any Guarantee obligation apply, the Notes
would to that extent be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the relevant Guarantor, including
trade payables of such Guarantor. Any future Guarantees required to be granted under the Indenture
may be subject to similar limitations. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on
_the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests._

**_The principal amount of the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loans forming part_**
**_of the Collateral may be less than anticipated as a result of prepayments of certain indebtedness of_**
**_the Group prior to the maturity date of the Notes._**

On July 23, 2020, the Issuer entered into the Existing Funding Loan (as amended on October 7, 2020),
a portion of the proceeds of which was used by the Company (together with certain cash available on
the Company’s balance sheet) to refinance certain indebtedness of the Company in connection with the
Engineering Acquisition. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the principal amount of the
Existing Funding Loan is approximately €114.4 million, which is significantly less than the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes offered hereby. See “Summary—The Transactions—The Financing of
_the Be Acquisition.” The principal amount under each of the Overlord Funding Loans is €385 million,_
all of which is outstanding as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.

On September 19, 2022, in order to distribute the proceeds from the Bridge Facility from the Issuer to
Overlord Bidco to be used in connection with the Be Acquisition, we entered into the Overlord Funding
Loans. See “Summary—The Transactions—The Financing of the Be Acquisition.” The principal
amount under each of the Overlord Funding Loans is €385 million, all of which is outstanding as of the
date of this Offering Memorandum.

The intercompany receivables arising under the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loans
will constitute part of the Initial Collateral and the Post-Issue Date Collateral, as applicable. Subject to
the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Initial
Collateral and the Post-Issue Date Collateral also secure, and following the Engineering Merger, the
Post-Engineering Merger Collateral will secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Notes, the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations (if any) and the Existing Term Loan on
a pari passu basis. Prior to completion of the Engineering Merger, repayments of the Existing Funding
Loan or the Overlord Funding Loans prior to the maturity date of the Notes would result in a reduction


-----

in the liability owed by the relevant Guarantor to the Issuer and any reduction in the outstanding
principal amount of the Existing Funding Loan or the Overlord Funding Loans would reduce the value
of such receivables and the Initial Collateral and the Post-Issue Date Collateral, as applicable, and, in
relation to the Overlord Funding Loans, also reduce the value of the Company’s and Overlord Bidco’s
Guarantees guaranteeing the Notes (as applicable). Any reduction in the principal amount of the
Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loans could also adversely affect the ability of the
Issuer to make payments under the Notes if the Issuer is otherwise unable to cause its subsidiaries to
pay dividends or make loans or other distributions to it. Subject to certain significant exceptions, the
Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loans documentation, however, prohibits the
repayment, reduction, extinction or equitization of the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding
Loans. Such exceptions include, but are not limited to (i) with respect to the Existing Funding Loan,
the repayment thereof to enable the Issuer to make payments of principal and interest under the Existing
Notes and/or the Existing Term Loan and, upon request of the Issuer, and the partial repayment thereof
in an amount not exceeding €15.0 million during the tenor of the Existing Funding Loan; and (ii) with
respect to the Overlord Funding Loans, the repayment thereof to enable the Issuer to make payments of
principal and interest under the Existing Notes, the Existing Term Loan and the Notes, and, upon request
of the relevant lender under the respective Overlord Funding Loans, the partial repayment thereof in an
amount not exceeding €50.0 million during the tenor of the relevant Overlord Funding Loan. Pursuant
to these exceptions, the Issuer may, among other things, cause directly or indirectly the reduction and/or
cancellation of either or both of the Overlord Funding Loans in the event of any mandatory or optional
redemption of the Existing Notes at final maturity or prior thereto, which would have an adverse effect
on the Guarantees granted by the Company and/or Overlord Bidco, as applicable, in respect of the Notes
offered hereby and the security interests over the receivables in respect of the Overlord Funding Loans,
the value of which may reduce to zero in certain circumstances. Moreover, the Indenture will not include
any restrictions on the Issuer or the Company to amend the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord
Funding Loans documentation, including to permit the repayment of the Existing Funding Loan and the
Overlord Funding Loans in order to allow the Issuer to discharge other debt secured by the Collateral.
See also “—Risks Related to Our Capital Structure—The Issuer is a holding company that has no
_revenue generating operations of its own and prior to the Engineering Merger will depend exclusively_
_on cash from the operating companies of the Group to be able to make payments on the Notes.” Upon_
completion of the Engineering Merger, the security interests in the Existing Funding Loan and the
Overlord Funding Loan I will cease to exist automatically, while the security interests in the Overlord
Funding Loan II will remain in place, until the date of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, at which
point the security interests in the Overlord Funding Loan II will also automatically cease to exist.

**_The Issuer, TopCo, the Guarantors and any other provider of Collateral will have control over the_**
**_Collateral, and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow the Issuer, TopCo, the Guarantors and any
other Collateral providers, as applicable, to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely
operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral to the extent that it relates to
their assets. So long as no acceleration event has occurred and subject to certain conditions, the Issuer,
TopCo, the Guarantors and any other Collateral providers, as applicable, may, among other things,
without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities
with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the
Collateral in accordance with the Indenture and making ordinary course cash payments, including
repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral, which
could reduce the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of
an enforcement of the liens on the Collateral.

**_On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will only be secured by the Initial Collateral.¶_**

On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will only be secured by the Initial Collateral. Security interests in
the Post-Issue Date Collateral will only be granted, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain
perfection requirements, within 30 days from (and excluding) the Issue Date; _provided that_ if the


-----

Engineering Merger becomes effective prior to the date on which the Post-Issue Date Collateral has
been granted, the Notes (x) will not be secured by the Post-Issue Date Collateral and (y) will instead be
secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the PostEngineering Merger Collateral within the later of 30 days from (and excluding) the Issue Date and ten
Business Days from (and excluding) the Engineering Merger Date. Additionally, within ten Business
Days from (and excluding) the Engineering Merger Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by security interests in the PostEngineering Merger Collateral. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” There can be no assurance,
however, that we will be successful in procuring such liens within the time periods specified, the failure
of which would result in an “event of default” under the Indenture. Once granted, the security interests
over the Collateral will be limited to the same extent as those under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility and otherwise as set forth under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on
_the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests,” which limitations could_
be significant. It should be noted that, as a general law principle, if a guarantee or a security interest
granted by a guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the secured obligation arose,
such guarantee or security interest may be subject to claw back provisions under applicable local
insolvency laws. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Other limitations pursuant to bankruptcy or insolvency laws apply to the Guarantees._**

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and
other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its
Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the
relevant Guarantors or to a fund for the benefit of that Guarantors’ creditors or (iii) take other action
that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that:

- the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over
another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant Guarantors or, in
certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the relevant Guarantee has the effect of giving a
creditor a preference or the creditor was aware that the relevant Guarantors was insolvent when
the relevant Guarantee was given;

- the relevant Guarantors did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or
corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee or the relevant Guarantors was: (i) insolvent or
rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became
undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that
it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

- the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant Guarantors or
not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the relevant Guarantors; or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law.

It is possible that a Guarantor or a grantor of security, or a creditor of a Guarantor or a grantor of
security, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor or a grantor of security,
may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantors’ Guarantees or grantor’s creation of
security on any of the aforementioned grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the
Guarantees or the relevant security interest should be limited or voided. In the event that any Guarantee
or security interest is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent such limitations on
the Guarantees or security obligation apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities
of the applicable Guarantors or grantor, including trade payables of such Guarantors or grantor to the
extent of such limitations. Future pledges or guarantees may be subject to similar limitations.


-----

Additionally, the grant of Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an
insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise be set
aside by a court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among
others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured
parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding
in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally specified “claw back” period following the
grant. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the
benefit of the relevant security interest.

Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given
statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims of other
creditors, even if such claims are secured claims. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Creditors under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging_**
**_obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture, the_**
**_Existing Indenture, the Existing Term Loan Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement on a “super_**
**_senior” basis are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority_**
**_to the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement
of the Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after
certain events, including the acceleration of the Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turned
over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions towards discharging
certain super senior obligations (including, among others, those under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility, certain hedging obligations (if any) and future indebtedness that may be secured on a super
senior basis in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Super
Senior Liabilities”)) in priority to applying any such amounts towards discharging the Notes and the
Existing Notes, and repaying the Existing Term Loan. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement
sale of any Collateral will, after all obligations under such Super Senior Liabilities have been
discharged, be applied pro rata to the repayment of all obligations under the Indenture and the Existing
Term Loan Agreement and any other senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors that
ranks pari passu with the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan and is permitted to be
incurred and secured by such Collateral pursuant to the Indenture, the Existing Term Loan Agreement
and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement.” Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also_
secure the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan will have priority with respect to such
assets over the claims of holders of the Notes and the Existing Notes, and the lender of the Existing
Term Loan. As such, the claims of the holders of the Notes and the Existing Notes, and the lender of
the Existing Term Loan will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the
extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**_Holders of the Notes are unlikely to be entitled to a gross-up for any Italian withholding taxes, unless_**
**_such Italian withholding tax is caused by our failure to comply with certain procedures._**

We are organized under the laws of Italy and are resident in Italy for tax purposes and therefore
payments of principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain or payment on
the Notes, may be subject to Italian tax laws and regulations. All payments made by us or on our behalf
in respect of the Notes will be made free and clear of withholding or deduction of Italian taxation, unless
the withholding or deduction is required by law. In that event, subject to a number of exceptions, we
must pay such Additional Amounts as will result in the holders of the Notes receiving the amounts as
they would have received in respect of such Notes had no such withholding or deduction been required.
We will not be liable to pay any Additional Amounts to holders of the Notes under certain
circumstances, including if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Decree No. 239 or
pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (“Decree No. 461”), except where


-----

we or our agents failed to comply with the procedures prescribed by Decree No. 239 in order to benefit
from an exemption. In such circumstances where we would not be liable to pay Additional Amounts,
investors subject to Italian withholding tax will only receive the net proceeds of their investment in the
Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Certain Taxation Considerations—
_Certain Italian Tax Considerations.”_

Although we believe that, under current law, Italian withholding tax will not be imposed under Decree
No. 239 or Decree No. 461 where a holder of Notes is resident for tax purposes in a country or territory
which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with the Italian tax authorities as contained in
the Italian Ministerial Decree of the Minister of Economy and Finance of September 4, 1996, as
amended and, supplemented from time to time and replaced, (the “White List”), and such holder
complies with certain certification requirements, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.
Moreover, holders of the Notes will bear the risk of any change in Decree No. 239 after the date hereof,
including any change in the White List.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The obligations under the Notes will be secured on a first ranking basis with security interests over the
Collateral that also secure our obligations with respect to the Super Senior Liabilities. The Intercreditor
Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the
Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the
Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

The Security Agent may refrain from taking enforcement action unless instructed to do so in accordance
with the provisions described in the following paragraphs.

If the transaction security has become enforceable in accordance with its terms and either (i) the holders
of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect
of indebtedness ranking _pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-_
priority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than
50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured
Creditors”) or (ii) the creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior
Liabilities at that time (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) wish to issue enforcement instructions
they shall deliver a copy of those instructions to the Security Agent and the other agents, trustees and
hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions (provided they are consistent with
the enforcement principles contained in the intercreditor agreement) received from (i) the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors; (ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination
as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months
of the initial enforcement notice or if the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully and finally
discharged within six months of the initial enforcement notice, the Majority Super Senior Creditors,
until the first date on which the Super Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the
“Super Senior Discharge Date”); (iii) if an insolvency event (other than an insolvency event directly
caused by enforcement action taken by or at the request or direction of a Super Senior Creditor) is
continuing, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred,
or (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of
enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors
determine in good faith that a delay could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the transaction security or on the expected realization of proceeds
of any enforcement of transaction security and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions
which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the enforcement principles as set out in the
Intercreditor Agreement and necessary or advisable to enhance the prospects of achieving the
enforcement objective before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior


-----

Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has
occurred. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions until it has been
indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) from any such instructing group that it
may in its discretion require (which may be greater than that contained in the Secured Debt Documents
(as defined below)) for any cost, loss or liability (together with applicable VAT) which it may incur in
complying with those instructions.

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, the
voting interest of holders of Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount
of indebtedness we incur.

The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of
holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue
their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders
of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells the Collateral consisting of the shares of
any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, claims under the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing
the Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens”._

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes
will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or
to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security
Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have
agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited
remedies and recourse against the Issuer and the guarantors of the Notes in the event of a default. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as_**
**_security for the Notes and other secured indebtedness may be secured by assets that do not secure the_**
**_Notes._**

The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the relevant Collateral. See “Description of
_the Notes—Security.” Not all of our assets secure the Notes, and the Indenture allows the Issuer and its_
restricted subsidiaries to secure certain future indebtedness permitted to be incurred with certain
property and assets that do not secure the Notes. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under
the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Guarantees thereof will not benefit from the assets securing
such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer
and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the Collateral
securing the Notes. The claims of secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the
Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the
claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors
to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

While the Indenture creates certain obligations to provide additional Guarantees and grant additional
security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of granting liens in favor of other
indebtedness or the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations
are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles. The
Agreed Security Principles set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to
be granted security or Guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of such Agreed Security
Principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided
being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Pursuant to the
Agreed Security Principles, Collateral will be limited to security over the shares of the Issuer, the


-----

Guarantors (and any other future Guarantors) and any member of the Group which is not incorporated
in an Excluded Jurisdiction (as defined below) which has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization (calculated on an unconsolidated basis and subject to certain adjustments) representing
more than 5% of the Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) of the Group (“Material Company”), and certain intercompany receivables owed to a
Material Company by any of its direct wholly-owned subsidiaries which are Material Companies and
certain material bank accounts of the Issuer, in each case, located in the European Union, United
Kingdom, the United States of America or any other jurisdiction in which a borrower under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is incorporated and not in any other jurisdiction (each other
jurisdiction being an “Excluded Jurisdiction”), but without prejudice to the granting of the Initial
Collateral and the Post-Issue Date Collateral. Accordingly, such agreed security principles may affect
the value of the security or Guarantees provided by the Issuer and any Guarantors.

In particular, even though the Notes, the Existing Notes, the Existing Term Loan and the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, are expected to share security interests and Guarantors’ package, except that
Overlord Bidco does not guarantee the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan, this may not be the
case and circumstances may arise in the future in which additional security or guarantees may be granted
for the benefit of creditors under the Existing Notes, the Existing Term Loan and the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility which are not otherwise permitted to be granted in favor of holders of the Notes due to
the application of the Agreed Security Principles and, ultimately, applicable financial assistance and
corporate benefit rules. Accordingly, in such circumstances, holders of the Notes would have no and/or
limited direct claim for payment against any such additional guarantor nor any and/or limited rights as
a secured party with respect to any such additional collateral.

**_There can be no assurance that the listing of the Notes will satisfy the listing requirement of Decree_**
**_No. 239._**

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no
assurance that the listing of the Notes on the Exchange will be granted in a timely manner or at all or
that, once granted, will be maintained. Additionally, the Issuer makes no representation that such listing
will satisfy the listing requirement under Decree No. 239 in order for the Notes to be eligible to benefit
from the exemption from the requirement to apply withholding tax.

The Italian tax authorities issued an interpretive circular relating to, among other things, the listing
requirement of the aforementioned legislation that may be interpreted to require that the Notes be listed
upon their issuance to benefit from the aforementioned provisions, including the exemption from the
requirement to apply withholding tax. In the event that the Notes are not listed or that such listing
requirement is not satisfied, payments of interest, premium and other income with respect to the Notes
would be subject to a withholding tax, currently at a rate of 26% and, subject to certain exceptions, see
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” we would be required to pay additional amounts with
respect to such withholding taxes such that holders receive a net amount that is not less than the amount
that they would have received in the absence of such withholding. The imposition of withholding taxes
with respect to payments on the Notes and the resulting obligation to pay, subject to certain exemptions,
additional amounts to holders of the Notes could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Collateral is limited to certain specific assets, the value of the Collateral securing the Notes may_**
**_not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or_**
**_diluted under certain circumstances._**

If we default on the Notes, holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the
assets underlying the security interests granted in favor of holders of the Notes. In the event of an
enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets
underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the
Notes. As described elsewhere, the extent of the Collateral is limited, including by virtue of the fact that


-----

no assets located in an Excluded Jurisdiction will constitute part of the Collateral, the shares of any
Material Company incorporated in an Excluded Jurisdiction shall not constitute part of the Collateral,
and any such Material Company incorporated in an Excluded Jurisdiction shall not provide any
guarantee or security in favor of the Notes. In accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, guarantee
and/or security shall only be granted by certain entities. See “Description of the Notes—Security.”

Trade receivables, inventories, intellectual property rights, real property and certain other assets of the
Issuer, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not constitute part of the Collateral. No
appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the Offering. The value of the
assets underlying the pledges and the amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral will also
depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going
concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale
and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers.

The shares and other Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes
may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of the Collateral may not be
liquid and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that
the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation
thereof. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only
permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of
potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and
any direct or indirect transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or
other regulatory consents, approvals or filings similar to (or different from) those that has been required
to be obtained in relation to the Acquisition, or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals
or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed,
a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly
decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral
will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to
any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes, such shares may also have limited value in
the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that
have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must
first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity.

As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of
value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over time.
If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of
the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a
senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and any Guarantors’ remaining assets.

The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of
the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties are
secured by liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security
Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to such assets
which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. In
particular by operation of the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, security interests in the Collateral
may be released if a lien is granted on the Collateral in favor of other indebtedness so long as such lien
is a Permitted Lien (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Permitted
_Liens”). Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture, holders of such Notes would_
benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your
ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.

In addition, as described above, the value of the Guarantees and the Collateral that will be granted by
the Guarantors will be limited further as described under “—Once granted, the Guarantees and the
_Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws_
_or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” “—_ _The principal amount_


-----

_of the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loans forming part of the Collateral may be_
_less than anticipated as a result of prepayments of certain indebtedness of the Group prior to the_
_maturity date of the Notes” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity_
_and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_The Collateral and the Guarantees will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and_**
**_other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or_**
**_after the date the Notes are first issued._**

The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely
affect the value of the Collateral and the Guarantees, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to
realize or foreclose on such Collateral and the Guarantees. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of
security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection
requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable law. The granting of the Guarantees
and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt
in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in
accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.

The granting of the Guarantees (and any other future Guarantees which may be required to be granted
under the Indenture) and security interests to secure the Notes, the Existing Notes, the Existing Term
Loan and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility may create hardening, claw back or voidance periods
for such Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions, including Italy. The granting of shared
security interests (including security interests in the Collateral), including in connection with any release
and retake of such security interest, to secure existing, new or future indebtedness (such as hedging
obligations or any additional notes issued under the Indenture) or the transfer or the assignment of the
security interest may restart or reopen hardening or claw back periods in certain jurisdictions, including
Italy. The applicable hardening, claw back or voidance period for these new security interests can run
from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected, amended, shared or recreated
(as applicable). At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the
end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared
void, ineffective, clawed back and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. Under Italian law, in case any
security interests (including security interests in the Collateral) is released and retaken at any time, such
release and retaking of security interests may give rise to the start of a new hardening period in respect
of such security interests. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, bankruptcy trustees, insolvency
administrators or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such security
interests. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The Indenture will provide that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken in several
circumstances, including in connection with a public offering of shares of common stock or other
common equity interest and certain internal “permitted reorganizations.” In Italy, for example, such a
release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to new hardening periods in respect of the relevant
security interests in the Collateral that are granted, perfected or released and retaken, and the security
interests in the relevant Collateral would be subject to the same risks described in the preceding
paragraph.

Similar considerations also apply in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as additional
guarantors of the Notes and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity interests
for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.

The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the Notes
are first issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize
or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be


-----

affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory
liens or re-characterization under applicable law. The Collateral may be subject to practical problems
generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The Security Agent may also
need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be
able to obtain any such consents. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose
upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore, because the
Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the security interests in the Collateral will be
governed by the laws of a number of different jurisdictions, respective realization and enforcement may
be further delayed by court proceedings being taken in multiple jurisdictions.

**_The recovery from the enforcement of the share pledges forming part of the Collateral may be_**
**_complicated, involve long recovery times and a low recovery rate and may require prior approval by_**
**_certain regulatory bodies._**

In connection with the enforcement of share pledges over shares of entities with outstanding debt
obligations, any sale of such entities is likely to involve a release of some or all of the debt of such
entity, which could result in a taxable capital gain to such entities. As the Notes will be issued by the
Issuer, an enforcement over the shares of the Issuer would involve the enforcement over the share pledge
of an entity with outstanding debt claims. In addition, the Indenture does not prohibit the Issuer from
incurring additional debt claims in the future. Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledge over
the Issuer’s shares may result in the release of the Issuer’s debt obligations, which could result in a
taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to reduce the proceeds of any recovery from the
enforcement of such share pledge. Therefore, the value of the pledge over the shares of the Issuer may
be limited. In addition, the Collateral includes, inter alia, a security interest over the shares of each of
the Issuer, the Company, MergerCo (after the Engineering Merger) and Overlord Bidco as applicable.
To the extent the enforcement of this security interest would result in an acquisition of a holding in the
Issuer, the Company, MergerCo (after the Engineering Merger) or Overlord Bidco, any such
enforcement would require clearance by the Italian Government, pursuant to the applicable Italian
Golden Power Legislation. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to enforce its
security and the value of the security interests may significantly decrease.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to_**
**_the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted_**
**_by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will
not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus the holders of the
Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security
Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents except through
the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed
to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have
limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory
provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken,
including Italian law, as applicable. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the
appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting
periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether
obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are
directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law
is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions (including Italy). In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws
and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability
of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt”
obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the


-----

Issuer and any Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as
applicable (“Principal Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy, these Parallel Debt provisions
would not be applicable provided Italian case law has not ruled for its application. All or part of the
pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security
interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under parallel debt
structures, the Parallel Debt will typically be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same
time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge
the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel
Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take
enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore,
the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition,
the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has
not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including under Italian law, and to the extent
that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly
granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not
receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and the Security Interests.”_

For example, in Italy the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be
created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative
(rappresentante) of the holder of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian
Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the
security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent
(rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on
behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings)
relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on
the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantee by a rappresentante
pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of
the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified
therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.

Furthermore, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the
security interests created under the security documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations
under the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other
creditors of the Issuer or by operation of law under the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian
insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions by
the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). A longer period may
apply to any Collateral governed by Italian law which may be granted after the Offering. Moreover,
under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory
priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect of the claims of other creditors, even
if such claims are secured claims. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The enforcement of any Collateral located in Italy or governed by Italian law is subject to mandatory
provisions of Italian law, including in relation to limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in
the terms of the Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory
requirements.

In case of insolvency of any Guarantors, the enforcement of any collateral provided by such Guarantors
may be subject to certain restrictions. For a more detailed description of various limitations on the
security under Italian law, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_


-----

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor
of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with
respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions
necessary to perfect any of these liens. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may
result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest, the holder of the security interest having
difficulty enforcing such holder’s right in Collateral or adversely affect the priority of such security
interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in judicial liquidation and other
creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral, which may have a material adverse effect
on the ability of the holders of the Notes to receive proceeds from any enforcement of the Collateral.
The Trustee and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps
or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically without your consent or the Trustee or_**
**_the Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Pursuant to the Indenture, under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be
released automatically, including a sale or other disposition of such Collateral in a transaction that does
not violate the asset sale covenant of the Indenture, as applicable, and in connection with an enforcement
sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture will also permit us to designate one or
more restricted subsidiaries that are guarantors of the Notes as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate
a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on the Collateral
owned by such subsidiary and any Guarantees of the Notes by such subsidiary will be released under
the Indenture, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce
the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such
unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.

**_The Issuer may amend the economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of_**
**_all noteholders with the vote of either 75% or 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the_**
**_outstanding Notes or the relevant series of Notes, as the case may be._**

The Indenture will contain provisions for calling meetings of the holders of the Notes to consider
matters affecting their interests generally. As set forth in “Description of the Notes—Meeting of
_Holders”, the majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of holders of Notes_
will be one or more persons holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Notes or the relevant series of Notes, as the case may be. These provisions permit
defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of the resolution, to bind all holders of the
Notes, including holders of Notes or the relevant series of Notes, as the case may be, who did not attend
and vote at the relevant meeting, and holders of Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant
majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an extraordinary resolution may include, among other
things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for payment of principal or interest in respect of
the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption or reduce the redemption
price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to change the quorum requirements
relating to meetings and/or to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and to change the
amendment provisions. These and other changes may adversely impact rights of holders of Notes and
may have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes.

Under Italian law, the approval of an extraordinary resolution typically requires the consent of more
than one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Our decision to increase the
majority requirement is untested under Italian law, may be challenged by holders of the Notes, the Issuer
and others, and if challenged, may not be upheld by an Italian court, with the consequence that the


-----

majority voting threshold may be reduced from 75% to 50%. Furthermore, the interaction between (i)
the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the
applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii)
applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes
issued by Italian companies is also untested in the Italian courts.

**_The insolvency laws of Italy and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the_**
**_insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar;_**
**_other limitations on the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral, including fraudulent_**
**_conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and
certain perfection requirements, by the Initial Collateral. Within 30 days from (and excluding) the Issue
Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection
requirements, by the Post-Issue Date Collateral; _provided that_ if the Engineering Merger becomes
effective prior to the date on which the Post-Issue Date Collateral has been granted, the Notes (x) will
not be secured by the Post-Issue Date Collateral and (y) will instead be secured, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral
within the later of 30 days from (and excluding) the Issue Date and ten Business Days from (and
excluding) the Engineering Merger Date. Within ten Business Days from (and excluding) the
Engineering Merger Date, the Notes will be secured by the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral (as
defined herein). Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Notes will be jointly and
severally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company and Overlord Bidco. The Issuer, the
Company and Overlord Bidco are incorporated under the laws of Italy. There is a rebuttable
presumption that the “center of main interest” as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency
Regulation”) is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions, including Italy, may not be as favorable to your interests
as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any
one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors (or any other future Guarantors which may be required to
grant a Guarantee under the Indenture) or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or
similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. In particular, the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement could be limited in scope and effect by Italian courts to the
extent their covenants and provisions, which are untested under Italian case law, could be considered
to conflict with mandatory provisions of Italian law. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or
similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings or their duration (which
may be significantly longer than the duration of analogous proceedings in jurisdictions you may be
familiar with).

In addition, Italian insolvency laws and regulations have recently been replaced by a new crisis and
insolvency code introduced by virtue of, among others, Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019
implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 of October 19, 2017 (as subsequently amended
and supplemented, the “Italian Insolvency Code”, also known as the Code of Business Crisis and
Insolvency), being a comprehensive and in material respects innovative legal framework regulating,
among others, insolvency matters. Other than for minor changes in certain provisions of the Italian Civil
Code, which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, the Italian Insolvency Code came into force
starting from July 15, 2022. The previous Italian Bankruptcy Law continues to apply only to filings for
proposals of declaration of insolvency procedures and bankruptcy restructuring plans (concordato
_fallimentare) and filings seeking the approval of debt restructuring agreements (accordo di_
_ristrutturazione dei debiti) or the opening of a composition with creditors proceeding (concordato_
_preventivo), in each case filed or pending before July 15, 2022. As at the date hereof, the vast majority_


-----

of the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code are untested in Italian courts and there is no guidance
or case law available yet on its application. Considering the sweeping nature of this reform and the
absence of judicial guidance, the impact cannot be predicted or fully assessed as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum.

As a consequence, enforcement of rights under the Notes, the Guarantees (and any other future
Guarantees which may be required to be granted under the Indenture) and the Collateral in an insolvency
situation may be delayed and be complex and costly for creditors. See “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests.”_

Although laws differ across jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and
equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in
courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the
enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor, the enforceability of any other guarantee of the Notes
and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral. In certain circumstances the court may
also void the security interest or a guarantee if the relevant company is close to or near insolvency. The
following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview,
describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s
fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of a Guarantor or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the Guarantees and the security interests, and intercompany obligations
generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or
conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

- avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantees or the
security interests provided by such security provider;

- direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantees
or any security interest on the Collateral to the relevant Guarantors or security provider or to a
fund for the benefit of the Guarantors’ or security provider’s creditors; and

- take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantees or security interests are found
to be a preferences, transactions at an undervalue, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or if otherwise
set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.
In addition, the liability of each Guarantors or security provider under its Guarantees or the security
interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or security interests not
constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside.

The amount recoverable from the Guarantor (or any other future Guarantors which may be required to
grant a Guarantee under the Indenture) and security providers under the Security Documents will also
be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a
determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Guarantees
or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—
_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral.”_

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts
would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the security interests
created, the Guarantors or security provider:


-----

- issued such Guarantees or created such security interest with the intent of hindering, delaying
or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others,
or created such security after its insolvency;

- issued such Guarantees or created such security interest in a situation where a prudent business
person as a shareholder of such Guarantors or security provider would have contributed equity
to such Guarantors or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Guarantees or
security interest knew or should have known that the Guarantors or security provider was
insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made;

- received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the
Guarantees or security interest on the basis that the Guarantees or security interest were incurred
for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantors’ or security provider’s benefit, or on some
other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the
Guarantees or the creation of the security interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other
reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the
Guarantors’ or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur, or
believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they
would become due;

- the Guarantees or security interest was entered into within a certain time period prior to the
opening date of insolvency proceedings of the Guarantors or collateral provider; or

- the amount paid or payable was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable
law.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider
generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantees or
created any security interest if:

- its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

- it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

- the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing
debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become
absolute.

Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests
granted to secure the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy or
judicial liquidation receiver or by other creditors or by operation of law under the rules of avoidance or
clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law (to the extent applicable), the Italian Insolvency Code and the
relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a
certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests” for_
further information.

If challenged successfully, the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received
must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided,
the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover
any amounts under the related security documents.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees
and security interests, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_The Issuer’s right to receive payments under the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding_**
**_Loan I prior to the Engineering Merger (if it occurs) may be subordinated by law to the obligations_**
**_of other creditors, and the Overlord Funding Loan II is expected to be eliminated in connection with_**
**_the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger._**

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to
protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In
this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the
company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any
entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in
the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a _società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be_
subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower
if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an
excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was
already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”).
Pursuant to Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code (as defined below), any payment made by the
borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to the judicial winding-up declaration are
ineffective by operation of law. The new provision replaced Article 2467, paragraph 1, of the Italian
Civil Code, according to which such payments would be required to be returned to the borrower. For a
more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw-back actions in an
insolvency scenario, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—Certain Italian Insolvency Law_
_Considerations—Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer” below. In addition to that,_
Article 292, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code sets forth that claims of entities exercising
management and coordination powers vis-à-vis the entities subject to such powers, and claims of the
entities subject to such powers vis-à-vis the entities exercising them, deriving from loans granted after
the filing of petitions resulting in the opening of judicial winding up in the year before, are subordinated.

The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that
such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a
company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, there are several court precedents interpreting the
provisions relating to Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code summarized above. Some of such
precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated
as joint stock companies (società per azioni), hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany
loans that are a joint stock company (società per azioni), and therefore potentially to the Company under
the Existing Funding Loan and/or the Company and/or Overlord Bidco under the relevant Overlord
Funding Loans.

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian
courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code in respect of the Existing Funding Loan
borrowed by the Company and the Overlord Funding Loans borrowed by the Company and Overlord
Bidco, respectively. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the Company’s and/or Overlord
Bidco’s obligations under the Existing Funding Loan or the Overlord Funding Loans (as applicable) are
subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should the Company’s and/or Overlord
Bidco’s obligations under the Existing Funding Loan or the Overlord Funding Loans (as applicable) be
deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to
the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under the Existing Funding Loan and the
Overlord Funding Loans, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its
payment obligations under the Notes. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on
_the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany
loans (including the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loans) or notes are subordinated


-----

by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over
such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interest granted by such Italian
subsidiaries (including the Guarantees) may be impaired or restricted.

In addition, the Overlord Funding Loan II will automatically cease to exist upon the EngineeringOverlord Bidco Merger.

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act
or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in the United States
except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements
of the U.S. Securities Act and the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction. The Notes are not
being offered in the United States. Accordingly, the Securities are being offered and sold only outside
the United States in an offshore transaction (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S.
These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors
in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries
comply with applicable securities laws. See “Notice to Investors.”

There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes
will be limited.

The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no market. We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including the liquidity of the market
for the Notes, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including
general economic conditions and our own financial condition, performance and prospects, as well as
third-party recommendations and any sales into the market by any Initial Purchaser which decides to
initially purchase any Notes for its own account. Historically, the market for non-investment grade
securities has from time to time been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the
prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes will depend on
the number of holders of the Notes and may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market
for similar securities. In addition, the trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and
this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. The Initial Purchasers have informed us that
they intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue
such market-making at any time without notice. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading
market for the Notes will develop or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained, and any disruption
in the trading market for the Notes may have a negative effect on your investment regardless of our
prospects and financial performance. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell
your Notes at fair value, if at all. See also “Plan of Distribution.”

Although an application has been made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange
and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or
remain listed, whether on the Exchange or elsewhere. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity
of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Euro MTF Market, failure to be approved for
listing or the delisting of the Notes (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another
stock exchange), as applicable, from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a
holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

**_If any series of Notes is redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a_**
**_comparable security._**

In the event that any series of the Notes is redeemed early in accordance with “Description of the
_Notes—Optional Redemption” and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor_
who receives proceeds due to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a
comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that carried by the relevant series of Notes.

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset_**
**_sale offer. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all_**
**_outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the_**
**_tender._**

If a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the Issuer will be required to make an offer
to purchase all the outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any
accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of purchase, and Additional Amounts, if any. In
such a situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under
any such offer and may need to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may
not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result
in a mandatory prepayment under the Existing Notes, Existing Term Loan, the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the
acceleration of such indebtedness (even if such change of control under the Existing Notes, Existing
Term Loan and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may be deemed not to be a change
of control for the purposes of the Indenture). Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes
upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indenture.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers,
recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such
corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do,
may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indenture. See “Description of the Notes—
_Change of Control.”_

Moreover, in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture, we will be required to commence an asset
sale offer, as defined under the Indenture, to all holders of the Notes pursuant to which we will be
obligated to offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued
and unpaid interest. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets
_and Subsidiary Stock.”_

In connection with certain tender offers for any series of Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw
the Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the
Issuer, purchases all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders of
Notes, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes of such series that remain
outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to
each other holder of Notes in such offer. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established_**
**_meaning under relevant laws and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain_**
**_that a change of control has occurred or will occur._**

The definition of “change of control” and the corresponding to the paragraph under “Description of the
_Notes—Merger and Consolidation” covenant in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a_
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a
whole), to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or
substantially all,” it has no clearly established meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts


-----

and circumstances of the subject transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of a person, and
therefore it may be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer are required
to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in
determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed
above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation
to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating
agency at any time. No assurances can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given
period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating
agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal
at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may
adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value
and trading of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment grade ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the Issue Date, the Notes issued under the
Indenture receive an investment grade rating from two of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and no default or
event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time
as the Notes are no longer rated investment grade by either ratings agency, certain covenants will cease
to be applicable to the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of
_Covenants and Release of Notes Security Interest on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” At any_
time when these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional
indebtedness, pay cash dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of
which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes
will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating if achieved will be maintained.

**_The Engineering Merger and the assumption of obligations under the Notes by the resulting entity_**
**_may be treated as a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

It is expected that the Issuer will merge with the Company in the first half of 2023, with MergerCo
being the surviving entity (see “Summary—The Transactions—The Whitewash and the Engineering
_Merger”). MergerCo, as the surviving entity, will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes._
Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position (to the extent we are required
to do so) that these transactions will not be treated as resulting in a taxable exchange for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. It is possible, however, that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) could take
a contrary view, and seek to treat the Engineering Merger and the assumption of the obligations under
the Notes by MergerCo as resulting in a taxable exchange of the Notes for “new” Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. If so, U.S. Holders (as defined in “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain
_U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) would recognize gain or loss in connection with such taxable_
exchange (although any loss could be disallowed or subject to significant limitations) and would have
a new holding period and new tax basis in each series of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
In addition, if the fair market value of a series of the Notes at the time of the Engineering Merger is less
than the principal amount of such series of the Notes (by more than a statutorily defined de minimis
amount), such series of Notes may be treated as issued with OID. Please see “Certain Taxation
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Pushdown._**


-----

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Required Consents—
_Provisions Following an IPO,” such change in the Issuer could result in a deemed exchange of the_
Notes for “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If such modification resulted in a deemed
exchange, such a deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, in which case, U.S. Holders (as defined in “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain U.S.
_Federal Income Tax Considerations”) would recognize any gain or loss in connection with such taxable_
exchange (although any such loss could be disallowed or subject to significant limitations) and would
have a new holding period and new tax basis in each series of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In addition, if the fair market value of a series of the Notes at the time of the IPO pushdown
is less than the principal amount of such series of the Notes (by more than a statutorily defined _de_
_minimis amount), such series of Notes may be treated as issued with OID. Please see “Certain Taxation_
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Required Consents—
_Provisions Following an IPO,” such change in the Issuer could result in an exchange of the Notes for_
“new” Notes for Italian income tax purposes having the same Italian tax implication of a sale of the
Notes (please see “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain Italian Tax considerations.”

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

If the stated principal amount of a series of the Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount equal to
or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount, then the Notes of such series will be considered
to be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If a series of the Notes is issued with OID,
then, in addition to the stated interest on such Notes, a U.S. Holder (as defined in “Certain Taxation
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) will generally be required to_
include the OID on such Notes in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues on a constant yield
to maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in advance of the receipt of the cash payments
to which such OID is attributable and regardless of the U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income
_Tax Considerations.”_

**_You may face foreign currency exchange risks or other adverse tax consequences as a result of_**
**_investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euros. If you are a U.S. investor, an investment in the
Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant
changes in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of economic, political and other
factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar could cause a
decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to
U.S. investors on a U.S. dollar basis. Investing in the Notes by U.S. investors may have other significant
tax consequences. See “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations.”_

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of_**
**_the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered Notes are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of
book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary (or its
nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holders of the Notes. Payments of
principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the relevant Global Notes representing
the Notes will be made to Elavon Financial Services DAC, as Paying Agent, which will make payments
to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that
hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants


-----

to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or
other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in
the relevant Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a
participant in Euroclear and Clearstream on the procedures of the participant through which you own
your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct
rights to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of
the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you
have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a
participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies
will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters or timely basis.

Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant definitive
registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you
will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The Issuer cannot assure you that the
procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely
exercise of rights under the Notes.”

**_The interests of one or both of the Sponsors may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

The Issuer is beneficially owned by funds advised by the Sponsors. The Company is directly and wholly
owned by the Issuer. As a result, the Sponsors have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal
and capital structure as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other
changes to our operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring action by our shareholders.
The Sponsors’ interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as holders of the Notes,
particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For example,
the Sponsors could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness or could transfer assets out of the
Restricted Group for the Notes, subject to the covenants contained in the Indenture. Moreover, the
Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in
businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us and/or that operate in our markets or adjacent
ones. The Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to or in
competition with our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to
us. In addition, the Sponsors may hold interests in suppliers or customers of the Company. Moreover,
the Sponsors have entered into the Existing Shareholder Agreement and the Be Reinvestment and
Shareholder Agreement that provide for the governance rules of, among others, Centurion TopCo S.à
r.l. and its subsidiaries and the Be Group. All significant actions to be taken by Centurion Newco and/or
Centurion Bidco will require approval of the board of directors of Centurion HoldCo, which approval
must include the favorable vote of at least one director designated by each of the Sponsors. If a matter
is not approved by the board of directors of Centurion HoldCo due to a deadlock that is not solved
through the procedures set forth in the shareholders’ agreement, the relevant resolution shall not be
adopted. As a result, even when your interests are aligned with the interests of one of the Sponsors, the
other Sponsor may disagree and be entitled to vote against a decision that would be in your interest.
Any such deadlock, if not promptly resolved, could adversely affect our business. The Sponsors and
their respective affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures (including
one or more divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our shares, in each case, to either or
both Sponsors, their respective affiliates or third parties, which could result in changes to our
shareholding structure), financings, dividend distributions or other transactions, all of which may be
implemented under the covenants in the Indenture and that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity
investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes. See “Certain
_Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”_

**_Total remuneration under the Notes will be automatically reduced if it exceeds the anti-usury cap_**
**_levels set under Italian law._**


-----

Under Italian law, any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by
an Italian company, to pay any portion of remuneration (including interest, default interest, fees,
charges, expenses and other costs and any other form of compensation related to the Notes) in excess
of the thresholds permitted under the Italian Usury Law may not be enforceable. Although the
applicability of the Italian Usury Law to securities such as the Notes (and, among others, related original
issue discounts and make-whole payments that may be due under the applicable indenture) remains
untested, the Indenture will provide that, if the remuneration applicable to the Notes (including interest,
default interest, fees, original issue discounts, premium, charges, expenses and other costs and any other
form of compensation related to the Notes (the “Total Remuneration”)) at any time exceeds the
maximum remuneration permitted under applicable Italian law (including the Italian Usury Law), then
the Total Remuneration will immediately and automatically be reduced to the maximum remuneration
permissible under applicable Italian law (including the Italian Usury Law) for, and limited to, the period
during which it is not possible to apply the remuneration as originally provided. This will result in a
change of the economic terms of the Notes which, in turn, may adversely impact the rights of the holders
of the Notes and may have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes.

## USE OF PROCEEDS

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be €385.0 million. The gross proceeds from
the Offering will be used, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i) repay in full and cancel the
indebtedness incurred under the Bridge Facility, including accrued interest thereon, and (ii) pay fees
and expenses in connection with the Offering and the Bridge Facility Refinancing.

The notional sources and uses of the funds necessary to complete the foregoing transactions are shown
in the table below.

Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the amount
of accrued interest on the Bridge Facility, the actual amount of original issue discount, as well as
differences in the actual amount of fees and expenses compared to our estimates. Any increase in the
amount required to complete the transactions described compared to our estimates may be funded
through other sources available to the Group, including drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility or other cash sources.

The following table should be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds,” “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements” and the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included_
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The following table sets forth the consolidated cash and cash equivalents and the capitalization of the
Issuer (i) as of December 31, 2022 and (ii) as adjusted to give effect to the consummation of the Offering
and the Bridge Facility Refinancing, as if they had occurred on December 31, 2022 and assuming that
the gross proceeds from the Offering will be entirely applied to fund the transactions described under
“Use of Proceeds.”

Amounts presented in the table below exclude deferred debt issuance costs. Unless otherwise noted, the
adjustments column does not give effect to movements in cash and cash equivalents or amounts
borrowed or repaid after December 31, 2022.

_____________

(1) Actual cash and cash equivalents reflects the cash and cash equivalents of the Group as of December 31, 2022, less (i)

the amount of cash for R&D grants collected on behalf of our partners (€31.8 million) and (ii) the amount of cash collected
on behalf of factors with respect to trade receivables sold to such factors and other restricted cash (€25.8 million), which
therefore does not belong to the Group, in each case as of December 31, 2022. As adjusted cash and cash equivalents
reflects the use of the gross proceeds from this Offering assuming issuance at par (€385.0 million), together with €11.0
million of cash on balance sheet, to (i) repay in full and cancel the indebtedness incurred under the Bridge Facility,
including estimated accrued and unpaid interest on the Bridge Facility through (and including) the Issue Date (€390.0
million), and (ii) pay estimated fees and expenses in connection with the Offering and the Bridge Facility Refinancing
(€6.0 million). See “Use of Proceeds.” From time to time following the date of this Offering Memorandum, we may repay
a portion of Be’s existing indebtedness using cash on balance sheet and/or drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility. As adjusted cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 does not include any other adjustments to our
cash and cash equivalents due to working capital expansion or contraction or any other cash generation or utilization since
December 31, 2022. As we carry out sales of receivables on a regular basis both on a spot basis and under the Intesa
Securitization Programs, as adjusted cash and cash equivalents includes amounts received from such sales. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting
_Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Accounts Receivable, Days Sales Outstanding (“DSO”) and Amounts_
_Overdue” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors_
_Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Revenue generation, cash collection and billing patterns.” As_
adjusted cash and cash equivalents has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what our actual
cash position would have been had the Offering and the Bridge Facility Refinancing occurred on December 31, 2022, nor
does it purport to project our cash position at any future date. As a result, our cash and cash equivalents as of the Issue
Date or any future date may be higher or lower than the amount of cash and cash equivalents as shown in the table above.
For further information, see “Summary—Recent Developments—Recent Trading.”

(2) Represents amounts drawn under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility originally entered into on July 10, 2020 to fund

the acquisition of Atlantic Technologies at the end of 2022. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” On or about September 19, 2022, certain lenders made available an_
additional facility under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of €35.0
million by way of a fungible increase of the total commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility to €195.0
million. See “Summary—The Transactions—The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Increase.”


-----

(3) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby. The gross proceeds from the Offering will be

used as described under “Use of Proceeds.”

(4) Represents €605.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes issued on October 8, 2020 under the

Existing Indenture, but does not include any accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the Existing Notes. The carrying
value of the Existing Notes (including interest payable) on our consolidated statement of financial position as of December
31, 2022 was €613.9 million. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Notes.”

(5) Represents the aggregate principal amount of term loans provided under the Existing Term Loan Agreement entered into

by the Issuer on October 8, 2020, but does not include any accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the Existing Term
Loan. The carrying value of the Existing Term Loan (including interest payable) on our consolidated statement of
financial position as of December 31, 2022 was €39.1 million. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Existing Term Loan Agreement.”_

(6) Represents the principal amount of the Company’s other financial indebtedness as of December 31, 2022 incurred under

our local bilateral lines of credit. Amounts shown include €53.9 million of Be’s indebtedness, which consists primarily
of indebtedness incurred under medium and long-term unsecured facilities as well as ordinary course business overdrafts,
guarantee lines (linee per firma) and other cash management lines, and exclude €13.5 million of put and call liabilities
and €10.4 million of IFRS 16 liabilities. For a description of our Existing Company Indebtedness, see “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Company Indebtedness.” From time to time following the date of this_
Offering Memorandum, we may repay a portion of Be’s existing indebtedness using cash on balance sheet and/or
drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

(7) Represents the principal amount of the financial indebtedness of the Group excluding, in each case as of December 31,

2022, (w) certain other financial liabilities of the Group that do not constitute indebtedness in the amount of €226.5
million, primarily relating to (i) payables to our partners in respect of research and development grants that we have
collected on their behalf (€31.8 million), (ii) non-current liabilities for payables to factors under our existing factoring
agreements in respect of cash collected from customers on their behalf and other restricted cash (€25.8 million) as well
as, (x) lease liabilities under IFRS 16 of the Group in the amount of €168.9 million (including €10.4 million of Be’s IFRS
16 liabilities). This amount also excludes the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the deeply subordinated

## MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

_The discussion and analysis below provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment_
_and understanding of our historical consolidated financial position and results of operations. You_
_should read this discussion in conjunction with our 2022 Audited Financial Statements included_
_elsewhere herein and the sections entitled “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and_
_“Selected Historical Financial Information.”_

_As the Company has only been consolidated within the Issuer’s results since July 23, 2020, the date on_
_which the Engineering Acquisition was consummated, in the discussion and analysis below, we present_
_historical financial information for the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods prior to_
_such date, and for the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods following such date._
_Accordingly, unless otherwise stated or the context suggests otherwise, all references to “we,” “us,”_
_“our” or the “Group” in respect of historical financial information in the discussion and analysis_
_below are to (i) the Issuer and its subsidiaries, when discussing our results of operations for the years_
_ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, and (ii) the Company and its subsidiaries, when discussing our_
_results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Furthermore, given the different scope of_
_consolidation, the financial results of the Company and the Issuer are not directly comparable._

_This “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” does_
_not include, and we do not separately discuss, the financial condition or results of operations of the Be_
_Group. Additionally, the discussion and analysis of historical periods included below does not reflect_
_the impact that the Be Acquisition will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash_
_flows, including the impact of purchase accounting (including changes in depreciation and_
_amortization)._ _As a result, our future financial results for periods after the Be Acquisition may be_
_materially different from the financial results of the Company and the Issuer discussed herein. This_
_section includes forward-looking statements, including those concerning future sales, costs, capital_
_expenditures, acquisitions and financial condition. Such forward-looking statements are subject to_
_risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those_
_expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Results of operations for prior years are not_
_necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future period. See “Forward-_
_Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”_

_As a result of the correction of the accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and_
_Other Information—Accounting Errors” in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the inability of_
_the Issuer to allocate the effects of such errors to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2022,_
_the consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 extracted from_
_the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and contained in the following discussion is not fully_
_comparable with (i) the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 derived_
_from the 2022 Audited Financial Statements, and (ii) the financial information as of and for the year_
_ended December 31, 2020 derived from the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements, in each case,_
_contained in the following discussion. For the same reasons, the financial information as of and for the_
_year ended December 31, 2020 derived from the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements is also not fully_
_comparable with the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in_
_the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the 2021 Financial Statements. In particular, the financial_
_information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 contained in the following_
_discussion, including any related averages, ranges and growth rates, is impacted by the accounting_
_errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors” and_
_Note 1.1 to our 2022 Audited Financial Statements describing the correction of major errors under IAS_
_8, and therefore you should not place undue reliance on such information. We have specified or_
_otherwise marked any such financial information, including any related averages, ranges and growth_
_rates, with an asterisk (“*”) throughout the following discussion. Neither the 2021 Financial_
_Statements nor the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements are included in the Offering Memorandum._
_See_ “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We identified certain accounting

_errors relating to 2022 and previous fiscal years, which resulted in an overstatement of the Company’s_
_consolidated balance sheet assets and operating profits, and the independent report to the 2022 Audited_
_Financial Statements included in the Offering Memorandum includes an emphasis of matter paragraph_
_in relation to such errors due to our inability to allocate their effects to periods prior to the year ended_
_December 31, 2022. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing our results of_
_operations and balance sheet assets among the periods under review in this Offering Memorandum,_
_and in particular those relating to our Finance industry vertical.”_

_The following discussion of our results of operations also makes reference to certain Non-IFRS_
_Measures, including organic revenue growth, organic Adjusted EBITDA growth, Adjusted EBITDA,_
_Adjusted EBITDA Margin, capital expenditure, cash conversion, net working capital, adjusted net_
_working capital and free operating cash flow. Prospective investors should bear in mind that these Non-_
_IFRS Measures are not financial measures defined in accordance with IFRS, may not be comparable_
_to other similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should_
_not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under_
_IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures.”_

**Overview**

We are a leading specialist provider of IT services, software and digital solutions in Italy, with a market
share of approximately 13% in Application & Infrastructure Implementation and 8% in Application
Managed Services, ranking first in three of the five industry verticals under Implementation services in
which we operate, in each case calculated in terms revenue (constant currency basis), in 2022, according
to Gartner® research (Gartner Inc., Market Share: IT Services Worldwide 2022, April 2023). We
provide a holistic suite of leading software and digital solutions to more than 2,750 customers, including
companies and public administration entities, and focus on supporting our customers in digital
transformation projects through a portfolio of integrated ICT solutions, products and consultancy
services. We couple new and advanced digital enabling capabilities, including AI and advanced
analytics, cloud-based services, cybersecurity, customer experience, IoT, robotic process automation,
AR / MR / VR, blockchain and digital twin platforms, with a strong know-how of traditional
technological solutions and an intimate knowledge of our broad client base’s core processes. For the
year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenues of €1,422.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of
€207.8 million (representing an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 14.6%).

**Our Industry Verticals and Activities**

We report our results across six industry verticals in accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments) as
follows: (i) Finance, (ii) Health, (iii) Industry & Services, (iv) Telco & Media, (v) Energy & Utilities,
and (vi) Public Administration. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Our Industry
_Verticals and Activities.”_

Our Finance industry vertical comprises services to banks, insurance companies and financial
institutions. Our Health industry vertical comprises services to public and private operators operating
in the healthcare sector, including hospitals. Through our Industry & Services industry vertical we serve
large and medium-sized corporations operating in various industries, including the retail, fashion,
manufacturing, and process agriculture industries, as well as public and private operators in the
transportation sector. Our Telco & Media industry vertical comprises services to customers in the
telecommunications industry as well as media services. Our Energy & Utilities industry vertical
comprises services to customers in the energy industry as well as utilities. Lastly, through our Public
Administration industry vertical we serve central and local public administration customers. In addition,
in 2022 we started implementing a strategic initiative focusing on the consolidation of our Energy &
Utilities, Industry & Services and Telco & Media industry verticals into a new business unit,
“Enterprise”. In addition, in 2023 for internal reporting purposes we consolidated our Health and Public
Administration industry verticals into our new “Public Sector” business unit. We believe that our new
“Enterprise” business unit will increase our ability to effectively respond to our customers’ needs, with


-----

the aim to deliver high-performing solutions and strengthen our role in rapidly evolving markets. In
particular, we believe that through “Enterprise” we will increase the coordination between our industry
verticals, while unlocking the ability to develop high-quality digital systems for the delivery of crossdomain solutions.

Following a strategic review of our business operations and positioning, beginning on January 1, 2022,
we also report our results by the following activity types, through which we offer our IT services,
software and digital platforms to our customers: Proprietary Solutions, Digitech and System Integration.
Compared to our former activities split, our Proprietary Solutions portfolio has remained substantially
unchanged (the main difference being the impact of the spin-off of our subsidiary OverIT in 2021) and
encompasses all solutions embedding software products for which we retain exclusive ownership
(regardless of whether such solutions relate to high-technological or traditional products), while our
previous allocation of services and products between Application Transformation and Managed
Services has been further refined and, as a result, through our new Digitech activities we aim to
consolidate our entire portfolio of professional IT solutions for high-technology third-party products
into a comprehensive hub, while through our new System Integration activities we aim to focus on
offering solutions for the management of traditional IT systems and customer infrastructure, thereby
enhancing our support capabilities. Moreover, following the completion of the Be Acquisition, we offer
a large portion of Be’s products and solutions portfolio (mainly comprised of Be’s business consulting,
information technology and digital business services) through a new fourth separate activity types,
Consulting, while the remaining portion of Be’s portfolio has been allocated to, and is offered as part
of, our existing three activity types.

Our activities relating to Proprietary Solutions include a wide range of cutting-edge, customized, endto-end IT services, such as industry-specific, innovative vertical software and related services for which
we retain exclusive ownership and which we make available to our customers on the basis of
individually negotiated licensing and subscription agreements. The activities we conduct in relation to
Digitech comprise the development and customization of high-growth digital enabling solutions using
advanced analytics, cloud, cybersecurity, customer experience, IoT, robotic process automation, AR /
MR / VR, digital twin and blockchain technologies in cooperation with our partners, including, among
others Microsoft, Google, Amazon, SAS, IBM and Oracle. In addition, Digitech includes activities
related to strategic partnerships with major software vendors including, among others, Salesforce and
SAP. As part of our Digitech portfolio we also support, maintain and update third party applications
and infrastructure. Our System Integration activities comprise integration services related to the
implementation, management and maintenance of traditional IT solutions. In addition, our System
Integration portfolio comprises other specialized services we offer to our customers, such as complex
information systems, customized system architectures and applications integration services (for new or
existing hardware and software). Our Consulting activities comprises the business consulting,
information technology and digital business services offered by the Be Group. See “Business—Our
_Business—Activities.”_

**Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition**

Our results of operations are affected by a combination of factors, including factors which are beyond
our control. We believe that our results of operations, and particularly the results of operations during
the periods under review, have been primarily affected by the following factors.

**_High Customer Retention Rate and Recurring Contracted Revenues_**

We have historically generated a large proportion of our revenues from sources that we consider
recurring and from customers with whom we have developed and maintained long-term, strategic
relationships. We deem revenues to be recurring if we expect to generate such revenues in one or more
of the following years, either based on specific contractual arrangements or our past experience, such
as revenue generated by existing customers seeking new products or services and long-term


-----

management or service agreements with customers for whom we have implemented proprietary or
customized software solutions.

We primarily generate recurring revenues from the activities we conduct in relation to our Proprietary
Solutions and Digitech, while revenues generated from our activities related to System Integration are
recurring. Due to the significant customization of our products and services, which we often develop in
close cooperation with our customers, we record low churn rate and high levels of contract renewals.

Typically, the activities we conduct with respect to our Proprietary Solutions relate to software products
for which we retain exclusive ownership and which we make available to our customers on the basis of
individually negotiated licensing and subscription agreements. Although the fee structure under these
agreements varies slightly across industry verticals, our customers are usually required to pay one off
upfront fees for the software license upon installation in addition to a quarterly or yearly fee for
customized maintenance services.

The activities we conduct in relation to Digitech include the development and customization of highgrowth digital enabling solutions, including third-party developed solutions. As part of our Digitech
activities, we also run third-party customized applications and end-to-end infrastructure for our
customers, by providing updates, maintenance and support. The revenues we generate from our
activities related to Digitech are backed by high levels of contract renewals due to our successful track
record of service delivery and the depth of knowledge of our customers’ complex IT systems that we
develop over time, which makes it more difficult and costly for customers to switch to our competitors.

We generally have long-term relationships with our System Integration customers and record high
levels of contract renewals. In addition, these customers display high retention rates also due to the
difficulty of switching to a different provider.

In line with our strategy to enhance our offering of Proprietary Solutions and Digitech and increase the
share of recurring revenues generated from related activities, we have, among other initiatives, focused
on the provision of digital enabling technologies and related services, including by conducting a
technical product transformation process that will enable us to supply certain solutions through a
software model sold in the form of a remotely accessible application (known as SaaS mode), primarily
for customers in our Energy & Utility, Health and Finance Industry Verticals. Once fully rolled-out, we
believe that such process will reduce the amount of any one-off upfront payments and increase the
amount of recurring payments over the duration of the relevant license contract.

The recurring and stable nature of our revenue is supported by long-term contracts and, more generally,
by the long-term, strategic relationships we have with some of our key customers. In particular, our top
ten customers by revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, have been with us for more than ten
years, and generated 30% of our revenues over the same period. We believe that the loyalty of our
customers is due to their satisfaction with the quality of our products and services, our deep knowledge
of complex IT systems and the core processes of our customers and the high costs required to switch IT
service providers. Products developed as part of the activities we conduct in relation to Proprietary
Solutions and solutions offered as part of our Digitech activities, excluding €23.3* million of Group
revenues unallocated by activity type in the years ended December 31, 2021, accounted for 31.0%* and
28.1%*, respectively, of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021 and for 26.6%* and 36.0%*,
respectively, of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022. Most of our products offered as part
of Proprietary Solutions activities as well as our solutions offered as part of Digitech activities are highly
customized, relate to complex or specialized technologies, and are deeply integrated into our endcustomers’ IT systems. As a result, their replacement and/or discontinuation would typically be a
complicated, time-consuming and expensive process.


-----

**_Sales Mix across Activities and Industry Verticals_**

Our results of operations are affected by the mix of sales of the products and services that we offer to
our customers across our different activity types and industry verticals through one integrated platform.

Following completion of the Be Acquisition, we have integrated a large portion of the Be Group’s
product and solutions portfolio into the offering of our Finance industry vertical. Moreover, following
the completion of the Be Acquisition, we offer a large portion of Be’s products and solutions portfolio
(mainly comprised of Be’s business consulting, information technology and digital business services)
through a new fourth separate activity types, Consulting, while the remaining portion of Be’s portfolio
has been allocated to, and is offered as part of, our existing three activity types. See “Business—Our
_Business—The Be Group.”_

_Sales Mix across Activities_

Following a strategic review of our business operations and positioning, starting from October 1, 2022
we offer our IT services, software and digital platforms to our customers through three distinct activity
types: Proprietary Solutions, Digitech and System Integration, which we operate across all of our six
industry verticals. Following the completion of the Be Acquisition, we offer a large portion of Be’s
products and solutions portfolio through a fourth separate activity types, Consulting, while the
remaining portion of Be’s portfolio was allocated to, and is offered as part of, our existing three activity
types.

The following table includes a breakdown of our revenues by activity type for the periods indicated,
excluding any revenues of the Be Group until its consolidation into our results on September 26, 2022*:

**Issuer**

**(in € million)** **Year Ended December 31,**

Group revenues unallocated by activity for the year ended December 31, 2021. No revenues were unallocated by activity
type for the year ended December 31, 2022.

** As a result of the correction of the accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—

_Accounting Errors” in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the inability of the Issuer to allocate the effects of such_
errors to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2022, the consolidated financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2022 is not fully comparable with the financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021, in each
case, derived from the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and presented in the table above. As a result, the financial
information for the year ended December 31, 2021 presented in the table above is impacted by the accounting errors
described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors,” and therefore you should not
place undue reliance on such information. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We
_identified certain accounting errors relating to 2022 and previous fiscal years, which resulted in an overstatement of the_
_Company’s consolidated balance sheet assets and operating profits, and the independent report to the 2022 Audited_
_Financial Statements included in the Offering Memorandum includes an emphasis of matter paragraph in relation to_
_such errors due to our inability to allocate their effects to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2022. Investors_
_should therefore exercise caution when comparing our results of operations and balance sheet assets among the periods_
_under review in this Offering Memorandum, and in particular those relating to our Finance industry vertical.”_


-----

(a) Represents revenues generated by Be for the period from its consolidation into our results (i.e., September 26, 2022)

through December 31, 2022.

We typically achieve comparably higher margins from sales generated through the activities relating to
our Proprietary Solutions primarily due to the significant customization and the highly specialized
nature of our products and services as well as their integration into our end-customers’ IT systems,
which enables us to charge our customers for the high added value of such products and services and
often results in long-term customer relationships and low churn rates. In the year ended December 31,
2022, we generated 34% of the revenue related to our Proprietary Solutions in our Finance Industry
vertical, 20% of the revenue related to our Proprietary Solutions in our Energy & Utilities industry
vertical, 22% of the revenue related to our Proprietary Solutions in our Public Administration industry
vertical, 20% of the revenue related to our Proprietary Solutions in our Health industry vertical, 1% of
the revenue related to our Proprietary Solutions in our Telco & Media industry vertical and 4% in our
Industry & Services industry vertical.

The margins we achieve from sales generated through the activities relating to Digitech can variate
widely depending on the specific features of the relevant product or application that we offer. Such
margins are typically lower than those we achieve from sales generated through activities related to our
Proprietary Solutions, but are typically higher than those we generate from the activities we conduct in
relation to our System Integration offering, which is due to the level of customization that we build into
third party applications and client-owned applications as well as the know-how and industry expertise
that we utilize to provide the relevant updates to, maintenance of and support for such applications. In
the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 12% of the revenue related to our Digitech services
in our Finance Industry vertical, 16% of the revenue related to our Digitech services in our Energy &
Utilities industry vertical, 14% of the revenue related to our Digitech services in our Public
Administration industry vertical, 2% of the revenue related to our Digitech services in our Health
industry vertical, 11% of the revenue related to our Digitech services in our Telco & Media industry
vertical and approximately 45% of the revenue related to our Digitech services in our Industry &
Services industry vertical.

We typically achieve comparably lower margins from sales generated through the activities relating to
our System Integration offering, because the System Integration products we provide, such as the
implementation, management and maintenance of traditional IT solutions, as well as day-to-day
management and operation services of our customers’ end-to-end infrastructure, are widely available
from other IT services providers in our market. However, the profitability of the activities we conduct
with respect to our System Integration activities is primarily driven by our ability to offer a complete
range of products and services to our customers from an integrated platform coupled with our knowhow and industry expertise, on the back of long-term contracts. In the year ended December 31, 2022,
we generated approximately 7% of the revenue related to our System Integration services in our Finance
Industry vertical, approximately 12% of the revenue related to our System Integration services in our
Energy & Utilities industry vertical, approximately 43% of the revenue related to our System Integration
services in our Public Administration industry vertical, approximately 7% of the revenue related to our
System Integration services in our Health industry vertical, approximately 12% of the revenue related
to our System Integration services in our Telco & Media industry vertical and approximately 19% of
the revenue related to our System Integration services in our Industry & Services industry vertical.

_Sales Mix across Industry Verticals_

We report our results across six industry verticals as follows: (i) Finance, (ii) Health, (iii) Industry &
Services, (iv) Telco & Media, (v) Energy & Utilities and (vi) Public Administration, in accordance with
IFRS 8 (Operating Segments). Revenue generation in each industry vertical is characterized both by
industry vertical-specific demand drivers as well as, especially in recent years, an increased demand for
digitalization products and services and an accelerating move towards the cloud, which is common to
all industry verticals.

In the Finance industry vertical, demand for our products and services is primarily driven by evolving
regulatory standards (including the implementation of the GDPR), the modernization of regulatory
technology (known as RegTech) solutions (which contribute in shaping our customers’ increasing focus
on the use of digital technologies to redesign and optimize internal processes), higher demand for
cybersecurity solutions and security operations centers (“SOC”), and increasing demand for payments
management solutions. Additionally, demand for our products in the Finance industry vertical is driven
by sales digitalization, the process of reviewing and innovating operational and organizational models,
as well as higher demand from customers in the growing fintech industry. We historically generated
comparably higher Adjusted EBITDA margins from sales through our Finance industry vertical
reflecting the high share of Proprietary Solutions that we offer within the Finance industry vertical as
well as our market leading positions across this industry vertical, which we expect will be further
magnified as a result of the completion of the Be Acquisition.

In the Health industry vertical, demand for our products and services is primarily driven by the need for
customers operating in the healthcare industry to modernize their IT systems and infrastructures, govern
data processing and design digital clinical pathways, often leveraging digital enabling technologies as


-----

well as data management platforms, as seen in the recent COVID-19 vaccination campaigns which we
supported through an offering of monitoring and governance bio-surveillance systems. We have
historically generated comparably higher Adjusted EBITDA margins from sales through our Health
industry vertical, reflecting our leading market positions in this industry vertical, the highly regulated
nature of the healthcare sector generally, which results in high barriers to entry for new competitors,
customer loyalty and the large share of high margin Proprietary Solutions that we offer in this sector.

In the Public Administration industry vertical, demand for our products and services is primarily driven
by the need for public administration entities to digitalize the relationship between citizens and public
authorities and modernize and enhance their IT systems and infrastructures, remote working
capabilities, as well as their data analytics capabilities to serve increasing volumes and manage
procedures more efficiently, and the increased focus on smart cities and smart mobility. We have
historically generated average Adjusted EBITDA margins from sales through our Public Administration
industry vertical, as compared to our other industry verticals, reflecting the highly regulated nature of
the public sector generally, which results in high barriers to entry for new competitors, and the average
share of Proprietary Solutions that we offer in this sector.

In the Industry & Services industry vertical, demand for our products and services is primarily driven
by higher demand for digital enabling technologies such as IoT and cybersecurity, cloud based services
and big data. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced an increased
demand for business continuity, remote work communication tools and tools to secure social distancing
and worker health and safety across all sectors in our Industry & Services industry vertical. We believe
that customers in our Industry & Services industry vertical, and in particular, customers in the travel,
retail and manufacturing sectors, will need to increase their investments in digital enabling technologies
in order to safely allow their workforce to return to work as well as to stay competitive in the long term.
We historically generated comparably lower Adjusted EBITDA margins from sales through our
Industry & Services industry vertical due to the lower share of Proprietary Solutions as compared to the
higher share of System Integration services that we offer in this industry vertical.

In the Telco & Media industry vertical, demand for our products and services is primarily driven by the
digital development that operators in the industry are undergoing in order to protect their existing
business and find new revenue streams, trends in the mobile payment business in Italy, increasing
demand for remote work and communication tools, the use of IoT capabilities in network infrastructure
work as well as the trend in using digitalization for marketing and retention purposes. In the periods
under review, revenues from our Telco & Media industry vertical have been driven to a large extent by
sales volumes generated from our mobile payment offerings, including Mobile VAS, a platform for incloud management services enabling mobile operators to sell value-added products and services to their
subscribers. Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA generated in our Telco & Media industry vertical
registered a lower growth in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December
31, 2020, primarily as a result of the significant reduction in volumes of mobile payments resulting
from restrictions imposed by the competent Italian authorities on the use of services through the Mobile
_VAS platform by such mobile operators. Revenues generated from Mobile VAS are no longer material_
and amounted to approximately €0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We historically
generated comparably lower Adjusted EBITDA margins from sales through our Telco & Utilities
industry vertical due to the significant pricing pressure in this industry vertical as well as our below
average share of Proprietary Solutions.

In the Energy & Utilities industry vertical, demand for our products and services is primarily driven by
smart energy initiatives, which include automation, smart metering and IoT as well as increasing
demand for our Net@Suite and Sistema Servizio Energia proprietary solutions. We historically
generated comparably average Adjusted EBITDA margins from sales through our Energy & Utilities

**_Increased Demand for Digitalization Products and Services_**

Our results of operations during the periods under review were affected by increasing demand for
digitalization products and services. During the periods under review, digitalization increased across all
of our activities and industry verticals, and was particularly driven by increased and more complex
regulation of our customers across several of our industry verticals, and the development and
advancement of new technologies such as cloud-based systems, as well as data management, AI and
cybersecurity tools and services. We also expect the increase in digitalization across all of our activities
to also be driven by the integration of the Be Group into our operations and, in particular, the integration
of Be Group’s Information Technology Solutions and Digital Business Services segments into our
solutions portfolio. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased demand for
digitalization products and services, especially from customers in the public sector, as they have been
forced to turn to remote working and cloud-based solutions to run their operations. Moreover, the 2021
approval of the PNRR in Italy underpins further increases in digitalization spend, particularly for
transformation projects from traditional IT to new digital enabling technologies.

In recent years, the implementation of several Italian and European governmental and regulatory
changes aimed at increasing the use of digital solutions has further increased our customers’ demand
for digitalization products and services. Such regulatory changes include: (i) the Italian Revenue
Agency’s (Agenzia delle Entrate) introduction of Entratel, mandatory electronic billing and filing
software for all businesses operating in Italy, in 2017, (ii) the European Commission’s introduction of
GDPR in 2018, which obligates European Union-based companies or companies that process personal
data about European Union subjects to comply with various new data protection rules by implementing
a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy implications of the
development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies or types of data, (iii) the introduction
of the Family Unit Allowance (Assegni Nucleo Familiare) in 2019, a regulation mandating that all
employee benefits be paid electronically, and (iv) the introduction of Nodo Smistamento Ordini in 2019,
a regulation mandating that all Italian national healthcare service providers submit their purchase orders
electronically.

**_Acquisitions and Disposals_**

Historically, value accretive acquisitions of attractive IT services assets have been a significant driver
of both organic and non-organic growth in our operations, breadth of product and service offerings,
geographic scale and revenue and profit margin. Including the Be Acquisition, between January 2020
and December 31, 2022, we completed 9 acquisitions of companies and business units (for an average
net sales of acquired targets other than the Be Group equal to approximately €10 million for the last
audited financial statements prior to being acquired by the Group). Accordingly, our results for future
periods will not be directly comparable to past periods because of the large volume of acquisition
activity that we have undertaken.


-----

The following table provides an overview of acquisitions we completed during the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 (excluding the 49% minority shareholding in our subsidiary
Cybertech, which was already included in our consolidation perimeter since 2019):

_____________

- Represents the amount of net sales reported by each target company in their last audited financial statements prior to
being acquired by the Group.

Historically, we have funded our acquisitions primarily with cash from operations and, in the case of
the Movilitas Group and Atlantic Technologies, with drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility (which have been subsequently partially repaid) and, in the case of the Be Group, primarily
with drawings under the Bridge Facility (which we also used to reimburse drawings under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility used to fund the Market Purchases). Going forward, we expect to fund any
additional acquisitions with a combination of cash on balance sheet and drawings under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, depending on our working capital and liquidity needs. In the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, we spent €20.9 million, €73.3 million, and €473.7 million,
respectively, as consideration paid for acquisitions of other businesses.

We believe our historical acquisition strategy has successfully increased our number of customers and
enabled us to expand our business to new market segments and a larger geographic area, while also
completing our product and service offerings which we can then offer to our existing and new
customers, particularly in the area of proprietary solutions.

Acquisitions and disposals affect our results of operations in a variety of ways. Our results for the period
during which an acquisition or disposal takes place and onwards are affected by the inclusion or
exclusion of the results of the acquired or disposed of business in our consolidated results. In addition,
the results of the acquired businesses after their acquisition may be impacted positively by synergies
arising from operational improvements and other cost savings or efficiency initiatives. We may also
experience an increase in operating expenses, including personnel cost, as we integrate the acquired
business into our network. Acquisitions may also result in higher levels of depreciation and amortization
expense. In addition, because acquired entities are consolidated from the date of their acquisition and
disposed entities are no longer consolidated from the date of their disposition, the full impact of an
acquisition or disposition is only reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent periods. As a
result, the historical results of operations for the periods presented in the Offering Memorandum may
not be fully comparable with each other or with our future results. In 2020, we completed the
Engineering Acquisition and began to report our financial results in respect of periods following the
Engineering Acquisition at the level of the Issuer, in accordance with IFRS. The impact of this
acquisition limits the comparability of our results from period to period. See “—Key Factors Affecting
_the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—The Engineering Acquisition in 2020.”_

With the acquisition of FDL Servizi S.r.l., a company providing software for smart grid-management,
in 2020, we expanded our presence in our Energy & Utilities and Public Administration industry
verticals, while increasing the share of Proprietary Solutions. In 2021, we completed several additional
acquisitions in Italy and abroad. In Italy, we acquired the smart working and collaboration platform for
businesses from Livebox S.r.l., Nexera S.p.A., a company specializing in the provision of IT solutions


-----

for advanced security systems and healthcare through proprietary solutions, as well as C Consulting
S.p.A., a company operating in the reinsurance market, which enabled us to both enrich our product
portfolio dedicated to financial institutions and insurance companies through high quality proprietary
solutions and to expand our IFRS and Solvency II consulting capabilities. In addition, we significantly
expanded our footprint in the United States through the acquisition of a business unit of Design
Automation Associates Inc., a digital automation player focusing on product design, analysis and test
engineering, and the Movilitas Group, an established U.S. player in the consulting space offering smart
solutions for the manufacturing industry which enhanced our industry 4.0 offering in the areas of
product tracking and tracing, digital twin, asset performance management and warehouse management.
These acquisitions enabled us to significantly strengthen our digital product and service offering in the
United States, which resulted in a €56.3 million increase in revenues generated in the United States,
from €15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €71.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2022. As part of our growth strategy, in 2020 we completed the spin-off of our subsidiary Sofiter
Tech S.r.l., which has exited the consolidation perimeter of the Group with effect from November 30,
2020. In addition, in 2021, as part of our growth strategy, we also completed the spin-off of our
subsidiary OverIT S.p.A., which has exited the consolidation perimeter of the Group with effect from
December 1, 2021. In 2022, we continued to strengthen our portfolio by completing the acquisition of
PluSure S.p.A., an Italian company specialized in product lifecycle management solutions and the
acquisition of Atlantic Technologies S.p.A., an Italian company specialized in implementing cloud
technology in the area of CRM, ERP and analytics which we believe will increase our exposure to high
digital growth platforms, while strengthening our consulting capabilities and reinforcing our expertise
in driving digitalization processes. Atlantic Technologies is an international leading partner of
Salesforce, Infor, Tableau and Orable, and assists its customers in enabling opportunities for recurring
business generation. Atlantic Technologies employs approximately 200 specialized and certified
professionals, working on over 2,000 projects across three offices strategically located in Milan, London
and Denver. In 2022, Atlantic Technologies revenues grew by 32.1% to €25.9 million, through the
acquisition of PluSure S.p.A., we expanded our product design solutions portfolio aimed at our industry
4.0 customers, and strengthened the positioning on the European markets of our eXcellence global
division. In addition, the acquisition of Atlantic Technologies enabled us to deepen our expertise in
driving the digitization processes of customers, through the consolidation of its longstanding experience
in operational consulting and the development of innovative digitalization paths.

We believe that the acquisitions we made in the periods under review have generated synergies for our
business and have contributed to our organic growth. Such acquisitions have given us, for example, the
ability to cross-sell the new products and services we acquired to our existing customer base and to
complete our product and service offering while, among other things, strengthening our design
integration and delivery capabilities for end-to-end lifecycle solutions targeting industrial products.
Once the acquired business is fully integrated in our business, we aim to increase its volumes of
operations leveraging our integrated platform.

In addition, the successful acquisition of the Be Group, which we completed in December 2022,
consolidated our position in the markets served by our Finance industry vertical and is expected to have
a significant impact on our cost structure and results of operations. For a more detailed discussion on
how we expect the acquisition of the Be Group to impact on our results of operations, please see “—
_Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—The impact of the Be_
_Acquisition.”_

In the future, we intend to continue to grow our business, through organic growth and highly targeted,
strategic bolt-on acquisitions, in Italy and abroad, with a view to expanding our existing product
offerings, strengthening our industry-vertical specific product offerings and increasing our share of
revenues from IP and digital capabilities. Accordingly, we believe that future acquisitions as well as
potential disposals will continue to impact our results of operations. See also “Business—Our
_Strategies—Continue to pursue targeted and opportunistic acquisitions to expand capabilities and grow_
_the business.”_

**_Investments in Research and Innovation and Capital Expenditures_**

To maintain our competitive position, we continuously invest in research and innovation and work to
create new products and integrate the results of our research into our digital-enabling technologies and
competences with an aim to continuously improve our IT solution offerings across all of our industry
verticals. In particular, as of December 31, 2022, we were involved in more than 100 research projects
implemented in over ten of our research labs, which are all located in Italy. We invested approximately
€25 million in 2022 in R&D, with a R&D Lab department relying on a team of over 500 professionals,
which includes researchers and data scientists (both directly part of our R&D Lab department) and
employees from our Development Labs, Competence Centers and Products Labs, who work in close
cooperation with our R&D Labs. In addition, we maintain over 150 global university partnerships with
strategic alliances encompassing our global research partner ecosystem, which includes universities,
research centers, technology companies and end-user companies. We typically capitalize the costs
related to the development of a new software or digital platform as an intangible asset and amortize it
over the useful life of the product (between three to six years). In addition, we typically capitalize
expenses for substantial updates to our existing product portfolio and add them to the original cost of
the underlying software or platform. Additionally, we generally expense development costs that
improve product performance or that are related to product upgrades as a result of regulatory
requirements in the projects that we create for our customers during the period in which they are
incurred.

Our business is characterized by low levels of recurring capital expenditures in line with the industry in
which we operate. Our capital expenditures for the periods under review primarily related to
investments in our three data centers. We incurred €15.5* million, €23.3* million and €54.6 million of
capital expenditures in the years ended December 31, 2020 2021 and 2022, respectively, representing
1.3%*, 1.8%* and 3.8% of our revenues, respectively. For further information, see “—Capital
_expenditure.”_

**_Our Cost Structure and Cost Savings and Efficiency Initiatives_**

Our cost structure is partially fixed. In the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, fixed costs
accounted for 62%*, 61%* and 58% of our total operating expenses, respectively. Personnel expenses,
which represented 55%*, 52% and 50% of our total operating expenses in the years ended December
31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, are the largest part of our cost structure and are largely fixed
due to our reliance on our skilled workforce to run our business, other than a small portion relating to
variable compensation and travel expenses. Other key fixed costs include rents and leases. The majority
of our variable and discretionary costs is represented by costs incurred to pay for external consultants
(approximately 4,700 in the year ended December 31, 2022) that we use to manage peaks of demand
from customers and which increase the flexibility of our cost structure. We account for these costs as
service costs in our income statement. Following completion of the Be Acquisition and consolidation
of the Be Group into our business, we have added approximately 1,934 new employees to our Group,
based on the number of employees of the Be Group as of December 31, 2022. The addition of Be
Group’s employees has further increased our fixed costs. Be Group’s personnel costs amounted to €79.6
million, €104.3 million and €132.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021
and 2022.

In order to support our resilient business model and increase our margins, starting in 2017 we launched
a number of cost saving initiatives with the aim of streamlining our operations and achieve annual run
rate cost savings, including management of vendors’ rates, workforce optimization measures such as
the near-shoring of approximately 270 full-time (as at December 31, 2022) employees to Serbia, as well
as other cost-saving initiatives regarding for example the reduction of travel expenses.

In addition, starting in 2022, we began implementing a comprehensive range of cost savings and
efficiency initiatives aimed at enhancing our operations and improving our ability to respond to changes
in the demand for our products and solutions, by further increasing the flexibility of our cost structure.


-----

In the aggregate, we expect our cost savings and efficiency initiatives to generate €16.2 million of
annual run rate cost savings by the end of 2023 (€9.8 million of which have been already achieved for
the year ended December 31, 2022), based on management’s assumptions regarding the impact of such
actions in the year ended December 31, 2022. We incurred approximately €2.5 million of one-off costs
in connection with the achievement of these cost savings, primarily related to the involvement of a third
party supplier with proven expertise in technology procurement and supply chain dynamics, and we
expect to only incur further de minimis costs for the achievement thereof. Once achieved, we expect
that these cost savings will structurally reduce the Group’s cost base going forward.

In particular, our key cost savings and efficiency initiatives include:

(A) Procurement initiatives, consisting of:

(i) the streamlining of our contractual relationships with external IT consultants through the

introduction of (x) competitive tender procedures, which involve our central procurement
function in each tender and (y) a structured supplier qualification process that we expect
will enable us to rely on a sub-set of preferred providers under optimized fee arrangements,
which we started implementing in the first and second quarter of 2022, respectively. ; and

## (ii) the reduction of costs related to the procurement of software products, primarily by (x)

consolidating our current software providers base into a limited number of distributors and
resellers, and (y) consolidating our IT spend with certain selected OEMs into few selected
contractual arrangements, which we started implementing in each case in the second quarter
of 2022;

We estimate that by the end of 2023, these procurement initiatives will generate €10.0 million
of run rate cost savings (€4.0 million of which have been already achieved for the year ended
December 31, 2022), representing approximately 2% of our estimated total addressable IT
consulting spend in 2022.

(B) optimization initiatives targeting the reduction of utilities, maintenance and rent costs related
to our real estate portfolio, including the reduction of our square footage at multiple locations
and office closures in up to three out of 13 non-strategic locations in Italy as well as the opening
of a new Group flagship office in Milan (Italy) with the aim of strengthening our image and
talent attractiveness, which we started implementing in the second quarter of 2022. We estimate
that by 2023, the run rate cost savings obtained through these activities will more than offset
rising utility prices and generate aggregate cost savings of €1.6 million (net of costs we expect
to incur in connection with the opening of the new Group flagship office in Milan), €1.2 million
of which have been already achieved for the year ended December 31, 2022; and

(C) a broad range of other cost saving initiatives, including the outsourcing of payroll activities, the
implementation of headcount optimization and reduction projects including nearshoring
activities in Serbia and adjacent countries, the rationalization projects aimed at consolidating
our legal structure, and vendor rebate management activities, which we started implementing
in part in the first quarter of 2022. These initiatives generated €4.6 million of run rate cost
savings, which have already been achieved for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In addition, we expect to generate approximately €9.5 million of further cost savings by the end of 2024
in connection with the Be Acquisition from the integration of the Be Group into our business. Once
achieved, we expect that these cost savings will structurally reduce the Group’s cost base going forward.
See “—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—The impact of the Be
_Acquisition.”_

We believe that the implementation of these cost savings synergies and efficiency initiatives will result
in a lower and more flexible cost base, which we can adjust to levels of customer and market demand,
thus resulting in reduced operating leverage. While it is our objective to reach the levels of projected


-----

cost savings in the timeframe and amounts reflected above, we cannot give any assurance that we will
be able to realize all or any portion of these cost savings and efficiency initiatives within the anticipated
timeframe or at all, or that additional or unanticipated costs will not arise, which will make it more
costly to realize such savings and the costs to be incurred in trying to realize these cost savings synergies
may be substantially higher than our current estimates and may outweigh the benefits. Our anticipated
cost savings synergies are based on assumptions about our ability to implement these measures in a
timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. If one or more of our underlying assumptions
regarding these initiatives proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher
costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated timeframe, the
expected benefits. In addition, the above information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and
may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or results of these actions and
initiatives for the period presented. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—
_Our cost saving measures may prove to be ineffective” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our_
_Business and Industry—We may not realize any or all of the adjustments to Pro Forma Run Rate_
_Adjusted EBITDA included in this Offering Memorandum.”_

**_Accounts Receivable, Days Sales Outstanding (“DSO”) and Amounts Overdue_**

We generally issue invoices to our customers on a monthly basis and they are generally required to pay
us within 60 days from receipt of the relevant invoice. While we believe our typical payment terms are
consistent with those of our peers, from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we carry
significant accounts receivable on our balance sheet from customers that generate a large portion of our
revenues. The lengths of payment cycles for services rendered vary across our different industry
verticals as well as the type of customer we serve. In particular, our public sector clients typically have
longer payment cycles (averaging approximately 260 days) than our private sector clients (averaging
about 170 days). Excluding the effect of non-recourse sales of receivables (both on a spot-basis and
under the Intesa Securitization Programs), our average DSOs in trade receivables, excluding the trade
receivables from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A, in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, was
approximately 195, 219 and 217 days, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, our overdue trade
receivables from public and private sector customers amounted to €84.5 million (of which €28.9 million
were due from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Sicilia) and €82.6 million, respectively.

We mainly experience overdue receivables from our public sector customers within our Health and
Public Administration industry verticals, which is a common characteristic of commercial relationships
between public entities and their private counterparts in Italy. Historically, the level of overdue
receivables from customers in our Public Administration industry vertical often comprised 50% or more
of the total amount of receivables due from our Public Administration customers. Additionally,
customers within our Health industry vertical have the largest proportion of receivables that have been
overdue for more than 120 days. Public sector-related customers sometimes follow payment
management processes that are subject to review by other government authorities or other entities,
which may cause delays or adjustments to their own payment schedules. Overdue receivables from our
private sector customers occur primarily within our Industry & Services industry vertical, followed by
our Finance, Energy & Utilities and Telco & Media industry verticals and mainly relate to small- to
medium-sized enterprises. Following completion of the Be Acquisition and consolidation of the Be
Group into our business, we have increased the number of our Public Administration customers,
including portion of public sector-related ones. While the portion of revenues the Be Group generates
from its entire pool of Public Administration customers is limited (amounting to €0.1 million, €0.1
million and €1.5 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022) an
increase in the number of Public Administration customers we serve following the acquisition of the
Be Group may have an impact on our overall overdue receivables. Following the consolidation of the
Be Group into our business, the majority of the revenues generated by Be Group’s Public
Administration customers has been included into our Public Administration industry vertical.

Delays in payments by our largest customers, requests for modifications to their contractual payment
arrangements or defaults on their payment obligations to us could affect our cash flow and results of


-----

operations. For example, as of the date of the Offering Memorandum, we are involved, through our
controlled subsidiary, SISEV, in two disputes against Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Sicilia for
total unpaid amounts of €131.1 million in nominal value related to the IT activities connected with the
building of an integrated IT platform for Regione Sicilia, within specifications and provisions set out in
the convention signed between Regione Sicilia, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and SISEV, which expired on
December 22, 2013. As of December 31, 2022, our total exposure to Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione
Sicilia amounted to €131.1 million, including €64.2 million of trade receivables and €14.5 million of
customer contract assets. Our trade receivables from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Sicilia included
receivables on invoices issued (€28.9 million), invoices to be issued (€35.4 million) and interest in
arrears (€52.3 million). As of December 31, 2022, we recorded a doubtful debt provision in relation to
these receivables amounting to €27.8 million and a related doubtful debt provision for interest on arrears
amounting to €52.3 million. As of December 31, 2022, our net exposure to Sicilia Digitale and Regione
Sicilia amounted to €40.9 million (€26.4 million, excluding €14.5 million of customer contract assets).
Except for receivables due from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Sicilia, we believe we have a good
track-record of collecting outstanding payments.

We mitigate our exposure to the risks relating to the collection of receivables through constant
monitoring of our commercial exposure and the collection times of receivables, which we track
excluding the effects of non-recourse sales of receivables. We have a dedicated team focused on
receivables collection and our sales representatives’ variable bonus includes DSO annual targets. In
addition, from time to time, we engage in the sale of receivables on the basis of uncommitted or
committed framework factoring agreements to manage our working capital especially closer to the end
of each fiscal quarter and the fiscal year. In March 2022, we entered into the First Intesa Securitization
Program, consisting a new committed framework factoring agreement with a vehicle controlled by
Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. providing for non-recourse sales of receivables for an aggregate amount of up
to €150.0 million at any time outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, €110.7 million were outstanding
under the First Intesa Securitization Program, while €39.3 million were available for drawing. In
addition, in October 2021 we entered into the Second Intesa Securitization Program, which provides
for the non-recourse sales of receivables from Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. For the year ended December 31,
2022, we have sold €122.6 million trade receivables under the Second Intesa Securitization Program.
See “Description of Certain Other Financing Arrangements—Existing Company Indebtedness—Intesa
_Securitization Programs.” See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” We intend to primarily rely on_
our operating cash flow and on sales of receivables under our Intesa Securitization Programs and on a
spot basis, as well as our Existing Revolving Credit Facility to satisfy our working capital and other
liquidity needs.

The table below summarizes the key factors affecting our trade receivables as of December 31, 2020,
2021 and 2022:

**_Revenue generation, cash collection and billing patterns_**

To a certain extent, we are subject to revenue generation, cash collection and billing patterns. In
particular, while our cash collection is stable during the first two quarters of each year on the back of
the ongoing fees we receive by customers under all our ongoing contracts, our cash collection usually
peaks during the fourth quarter of each year due to the finalization of accounts and payment of invoices
by our customers in anticipation of the end of the financial year. Our cash collection is typically lowest
during the third quarter of each year due primarily to extended school holidays in Italy during the month
of August. Maintenance fees are typically collected quarterly and yearly, starting from when the initial
purchase order is made by the relevant customer. Our billing cycle and the recognition of revenues in
our income statement is typically subject to similar drivers, with a stable level of revenues recorded in
the first two quarters of each year, when we collect purchase orders from customers, and the highest
revenues recorded during the third and fourth quarter of each year when we typically issue invoices to
our customers in connection with the formalization of purchase orders as binding contracts and the
finalization of our yearly accounts. Our working capital levels are also subject to similar drivers, with
our working capital levels typically peaking in September of each year, in connection with payments of
invoices by our customers, before gradually declining to their low point in December of each year.

From time to time, we carry significant accounts receivable balances from a limited number of
customers that generate a large portion of our revenues. In addition, we engage in the sale of receivables
on the basis of uncommitted or committed framework non-recourse factoring agreements in order to
support our working capital and liquidity needs. In March 2022, we entered into the First Intesa
Securitization Program, consisting of a new committed framework factoring agreement with a vehicle
controlled by Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. providing for non-recourse sales of receivables for an aggregate
amount of up to €150.0 million at any time outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, €110.7 million were
outstanding under the First Intesa Securitization Program, while €39.3 million were available for
drawing. In addition, in October 2021 we entered into the Second Intesa Securitization Program, which
provides for the non-recourse sales of receivables from Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. For the year ended


-----

December 31, 2022, we have sold €122.6 million trade receivables under the Second Intesa
Securitization Program. See “Description of Certain Other Financing Arrangements—Existing
_Company Indebtedness—Intesa Securitization Programs.” See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_
We intend to primarily rely on our operating cash flow and on sales of receivables under our Intesa
Securitization Programs and on a spot basis, as well as our Existing Revolving Credit Facility to satisfy
our working capital and other liquidity needs. Billed and unbilled receivables, as well as DSOs in
accounts receivable, net of deferred revenue, can vary based on the timing and size of cash receipts.
Typically, receivables sold through non-recourse sales of receivables are written off from our financial
statements upon their transfer, as all risks and benefits of the factored receivables are irrevocably
transferred to the transferee. As a result of sales of receivables under the Intesa Securitization Programs
and other spot sales of receivables, as of December 31, 2022, as part of our receivables management
strategy and to support our M&A activity we sold €787.8 million of trade receivables on a non-recourse
basis, €133.3 million of which were still outstanding at period end (excluding €121.2 million of trade
receivables sold on a non-recourse basis by Be, €39.6 million of which were still outstanding as of
December 31, 2022). Prior to the Be Acquisition, Be also engaged in the sale of receivables on the basis
of non-recourse factoring agreements.

Our results of operations are also affected by varying billing and invoicing patterns among our different
activity types, industry verticals and types of customers. Sales cycles vary among our different industry
verticals and types of customers, with the time between the date a contract is entered into and the
beginning of the provision of services ranging from an average of six months for private sector
customers to one to two years for contracts awarded under public tenders. Because we recognize
revenues only upon the actual provision of the contracted services and achievement of other recognition
criteria, the financial benefit of gaining a new client may not be realized at the intended time due to
delays in the implementation of our services or due to an increase in the start-up costs required in
building our infrastructure.

**_Italian and global macroeconomic conditions, market trends and customer demands_**

We primarily operate our business in Italy where we generated 82% and 88%* of our revenues for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. In addition, our headquarters
and our three data centers are located in Italy. As a result, although our revenues have remained resilient
through volatile macroeconomic cycles during the past 20 years, with our revenues’ organic growth
continuously outperforming Italian GDP growth on a year-over-year basis, macroeconomic conditions,
political instability, market trends and customer demand in Italy have a significant impact on our results
of operations. Prior to 2015, IT services spend in Italy generally grew in line with GDP growth after
which growth in IT services spend increasingly outperformed the Italian GDP growth. See “Industry
_and Market Overview—Large and attractive addressable markets.” Between 2019 and 2021, the Italian_
ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets grew at a CAGR of approximately 4.4% and were
worth approximately €21.8 billion in 2021 (and such markets are expected to have grown to €23 billion
in 2022), according to Anitec-Assinform. This growth was primarily driven by ongoing digitalization
across the Italian public and private sectors and increasing spending in transformation projects from
traditional IT to new digital enabling technologies, which further increased underpinned by PNRR
adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our results of operations and financial condition are also impacted by other global macroeconomic
factors such as the prevailing market interest rates, overall inflation levels and energy and logistics
costs. In particular, increases in interest rates, which are determined and controlled by central banks in
response to macroeconomic events (including the recent December 2022, February 2023 and March
2023 increases by the European Central Bank), may negatively affect general economic growth in the
countries in which we operate and, consequently, could have a negative impact on the demand for our
solutions as well as our financing costs. On the other hand, inflation surges and the increase in energy
costs may have a negative impact on our cost base and overall profitability levels. While our customers
in the Industry & Services vertical have been negatively impacted by rising energy costs, this has not
resulted in a slowdown of our business in the year ended December 31, 2022. Rising energy costs have


-----

primarily impacted our cost base but did not have any direct negative impacts on our business
operations. While we do not maintain a hedging strategy in place for our energy costs, in light of the
current macroeconomic conditions we are reviewing the structure of our customer contracts and are
planning to include inflation pass-through provisions going forward.

In addition, partly as a result of the ongoing interest rate surge, in March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank,
one of the largest U.S. banks in the technology sector, collapsed, representing the largest global bank
failure since the 2008 financial crisis and requiring immediate government intervention. This collapse
caused challenges for several U.S. regional banks and was shortly followed by the shutdown by U.S.
regulators of a smaller U.S.-based bank, Signature Bank, and the downfall in Credit Suisse’s share price,
which was followed, in turn, by the announced merger brokered by Swiss authorities between Credit
Suisse and UBS. The pressure on U.S. regional banks has continued, leading to the announcement by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on May 1, 2023, that First Republic Bank, a California based
regional bank, would be taken over by JPMorgan Chase. While the situation continues to develop and
the industry-wide impact of these events is not yet clear, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum,
it is not possible to predict the impact that these events failures may have on the U.S. and global banking
and financial systems and monetary policy, and any potential associated effect on the Italian economy,
the economies of the other countries where we operate and, in turn, on our customers operating in the
financial sector. The failure or financial distress of any of our our lenders or financial counterparties or
those of our customers, could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to fund our ongoing
working capital needs and general corporate purposes. A deterioration of the international financial
systems could also result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates
or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and
liquidity sources, which could negatively impact our ability to acquire financing on acceptable terms or
at all. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Continued increases in
_electricity costs may adversely affect our results of operations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to_
_Our Business and Industry—Our business may be adversely affected by global economic conditions,_
_political events and geopolitical conflicts, including political and economic uncertainty in Italy and_
_Europe.”_

**_Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic_**

Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian economy contracted sharply during
2020, recording a year-on-year contraction in GDP of 8.9% (source: ISTAT) as the country was one of
the hardest hit and several lockdowns and other restrictive measures were imposed. The global COVID19 pandemic has had a material impact on economic activity across our markets and on our business
operations, particularly in 2020. For example, to manage our cost structure and reduce our cash burn,
in connection with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, for the year ended December 31, 2020,
we reduced our travel costs by €17.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and
placed a limited number of our projects as well as employees within certain specific functions (such as
our internal travel agency and the employees of our tax collection business, Municipia S.p.A.) on
temporary government subsidy programs, which drove a reduction of our personnel costs in 2020
compared to 2019. The restrictions imposed in the context of the first outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic also resulted in lower service costs due to a decrease in the utilization of external professional
resources in our business. Due to the removal and loosening of the various restrictions imposed by
governments to counter the spread of COVID-19 in 2020 and in light of the related improving
macroeconomical framework in 2021, we fully reduced our reliance on the abovementioned
governmental subsidy programs and increased the number of external professional resources in our
operations, which led to an increase in both personnel costs and service costs in 2021 compared to 2020.

Despite the limited revenue decline caused by outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, certain industry verticals
proved to be resilient. In particular, in the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced an increase
in revenues across two of our six verticals (Health and Public Administration, which increased by 11.2%
and 3.7%, respectively, compared to 2019), primarily as a result of increased customer demand for our
digital solutions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions and lockdown measures


-----

imposed in response thereto. Revenues in our Finance industry vertical remained stable as a result of
increased sales generated by consulting solutions. On the other hand, we experienced a revenue decline
in our Industry & Services vertical (by 6.8%), particularly due to reduced demand from customers in
the leisure travel and cruise industry, and in our Telco & Media industry vertical (by 18.3%),
particularly as a result of the significant reduction in volumes generated on _Mobile VAS, a platform_
enabling mobile operators to sell value-added products and services to customers with subscriptions,
resulting from restrictions imposed by the competent Italian authorities on the use of services through
such platform by such mobile operators. In addition, new requirements were introduced over the same
period by the competent Italian authorities for operators to implement new control and safety measures
in connection with their customer acquisition processes, which requirements drove a 80% decrease of
revenues from our sales of customer acquisition processes solutions to customers in the Telco & Media
industry vertical in 2020 compared to 2019. Such reduction in revenues has also continued in
subsequent periods and while we recorded revenues of €1.5* million from Mobile VAS solutions in the
year ended December 31, 2021, these declined to approximately €0.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. As a result, revenues generated from Mobile VAS are no longer material.

Throughout 2021 and 2022, the Italian GDP experienced a rebound, and grew year-on-year by 6.5%
and 3.8%, respectively. Over the same period, our business has begun to experience stronger rates of
growth. In particular, in the year ended December 31, 2021, our overall revenues increased across all
of our industry verticals, with the strongest increase in our Health industry vertical, which was 25.3*%
higher compared to 2020. This increase was primarily due to the award of new contracts as well as
additional healthcare investments by our existing customers, which were driven by the COVID-19
pandemic. Over the same period revenues generated in our Industry & Services industry also increased
by 12.2%*, compared to 2020, driven among others by a global macroeconomic recovery from COVID19 positively impacting customers in the automotive and transportation sectors mainly due to the
removal or loosening of the majority of the restrictions, including on travel, that had been imposed to
limit the spread of COVID-19 in 2020. Overall, our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2021
increased by 6.5%* compared to 2020. See “—Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2020
_compared with Year Ended December 31, 2021.”_

We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our supply chain has been limited, as our
suppliers and partners have been able to work remotely and we benefit from a limited reliance on
physical product deliveries. Overall, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have
experienced a general increase in customer demand for digitalization products and services across
almost all of our industry verticals, as businesses and public administration entities have been forced to
rely on their IT infrastructures and systems and have turned to remote working and cloud-based
solutions to run their operations.

As a result of the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, the
comparability of our results for the periods under review (particularly for the year ended December 31,
2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020), with the relevant corresponding periods and the
comparability with future periods may be limited.

**_Public ICT spending and our ability to continue to being awarded contracts by Public Administration_**
**_customers as a result of successful public tenders_**

A substantial portion of our revenues, and, particularly, revenues generated through our Public
Administration industry vertical, has been and will continue to be generated by sales to our public sector
customers in Italy. Substantially all of the services we provide to these customers are awarded through
public tender processes. Given the significance of the Public Administration industry vertical to our
results, the level of spending by governmental and other public entities on technological infrastructure
and other technology-related investments is important to our business.

According to the Italian government’s official figures, government spending on information and
communication technology was estimated at €6.2 billion in 2020, and is projected to have increased to


-----

€6.5 billion in 2021, and to €7.0 billion in 2022, compared to a €5.6 billion average spending level
between 2016 and 2018. Any increase or decrease in such public spending could impact our customers’
available budgets and, consequently, our results of operations. In addition, Italy’s PNRR approved by
the European Commission in June 2021, supports the digital transition with expected additional
information and communication technology investments, particularly with respect to its (a) “Mission
1”, which allocates a budget of approximately €30 billion to investments in digitalization, innovation,
competitiveness, culture and tourism, including in the following areas: (ii) digital transition, innovation
and competitiveness of the Italian production system, by means of grants and incentives including for
4.0 technologies and training (€20.8 billion by 2026), and (iii) enhanced digitalization of the Italian
public sector (€ 5.9 billion by 2026), and its (b) “Mission 6”, which allocates a budget of approximately
€11 billion to investments in innovation, research and digitalization of the national healthcare system.
Current political instability in Italy may however jeopardize the implementation of the PNRR and result
in the delay, suspension and/or discontinuation of any programs aimed at encouraging IT spend. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our business may be adversely affected
_by global economic conditions, political events and geopolitical conflicts, including political and_
_economic uncertainty in Italy and Europe.”_

Our continued success in being awarded contracts as a result of public tenders by Public Administration
customers depends, among other things, on the availability and quality of the contracts put out to tender,
which in turn is driven by Italian and EU government budgets and policies, as well as our ability to
anticipate and effectively respond to changes in market trends. Our success will also depend on our
ability to estimate resources and costs in the context of a competitive tender process in order to quote
at a competitive yet profitable pricing level, should the tender be successful. Further, our success will
depend on our ability to adapt to the stricter regulatory requirements required for participating in
governmental contracts.

**Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations**

**_The Engineering Acquisition in 2020_**

The Issuer was incorporated on March 20, 2020 in connection with the Engineering Acquisition. As of
the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer is a holding company with no revenue-generating
activities of its own, and no business operations, material assets, other than the shares it holds in the
Company and its receivables under the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loan I, or
material liabilities, other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation, the Engineering
Acquisition and the transactions related thereto, including the Existing Notes, the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility, the Existing Term Loan and the €210.0 million deeply subordinated shareholder loan
granted by TopCo to the Issuer in 2020 in connection with the Engineering Acquisition. Because the
Company was consolidated within the Issuer’s results since the Engineering Acquisition Closing Date
(July 23, 2020), the Issuer’s statement of consolidated income information and the statement of cash
flow for the year ended December 31, 2020, presented in the comparative column of the 2021 Financial
Statements (which are not included in this Offering Memorandum): (i) approximately seven months of
operations of the Issuer only, without any results from the Group prior to the Engineering Acquisition
Closing Date, and (ii) approximately five months of operations of the Group after the Engineering
Acquisition Closing Date. As a result, in this Offering Memorandum we present and discuss historical
financial information for the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods prior to such date,
and for the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods following such date. However, given the
different scope of consolidation, the financial results of the Company and the Issuer are not directly
comparable. In particular, the information included in the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 (including the financial data for the period between March
20, 2020 (the date of incorporation of the Issuer) and December 31, 2020) are not directly comparable
to the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements due to the different scope of consolidation, which results,
among other things, in the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2021 also including indebtedness and cash at the level of the Issuer (including €605.0
million of indebtedness under the Existing Notes and €38.4 million indebtedness under the Existing


-----

Term Loan, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the €210.0 million deeply subordinated shareholder
loan granted by TopCo to the Issuer in 2020 in connection with the Engineering Acquisition, and
associated interest payments). In addition, we have accounted for the Engineering Acquisition using the
acquisition method of accounting under IFRS 3 - “Business Combinations” and applied purchase
accounting adjustments in connection with the Engineering Acquisition to the financial statements for
accounting periods subsequent to the Engineering Acquisition Closing Date. However, our consolidated
financial statements for periods prior to the Engineering Acquisition Closing Date have not been
adjusted retrospectively to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statements, statements of
financial position or cash flow statements that occurred as a result of purchase accounting adjustments
applied to the Engineering Acquisition. The most material differences between the financial information
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the 2021 Financial Statements as compared
to the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements relate to amortization and depreciation, financial expenses
and income taxes. For example, amortization and depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2021
included in the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2021 was higher by €35.7* million compared to the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements. This is
mainly due to incremental amortization charges of customer lists and customer relationships recognized
by the Issuer following completion of the Engineering Acquisition. Financial expenses recorded in the
audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in
the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 was
higher by €55.9* million compared to the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements. This is mainly due to
the payments of €24.1 million in interest expense on the Existing Funding Loan and €37.8 million in
interest expense on the Existing Notes made by the Issuer. Income taxes for the year ended December
31, 2021 included in the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2021 was higher by €94.3* million compared to the Company’s 2020 Financial
Statements. This is mainly due to tax credits recorded by the Issuer over the same period. As a result of
the differences described above, the 2021 Financial Statements are not directly comparable to the
information included in the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements. Similar differences exist, mutatis
_mutandis, with respect to the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended_
December 31, 2022 included in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements. See also “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Business and Industry—Certain line items contained in the 2022 Audited Financial_
_Statements and the 2021 Financial Statements are not comparable to the corresponding line items_
_included in the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements.” Neither the 2021 Financial Statements nor the_
Company’s 2020 Financial Statements are included in the Offering Memorandum.

**_The impact of the Be Acquisition_**

On September 26, 2022, we successfully completed the Initial Acquisition and thereby indirectly
acquired a majority stake in the Be Group. As a result, since such date Be’s results have been
consolidated into our Group’s results. Subsequently, in December 2022, we acquired all the remaining
shares of Be through the Market Purchases, the Mandatory Offer and the Squeeze-Out, and as of the
date of this Offering Memorandum we wholly own the Be Group. See “Summary—The Transactions—
_The Be Acquisition.” The integration of the Be Group into the Group has increased our size, revenue-_
generating ability and cost base.

The below table sets forth the Be Group’s revenue and EBITDA for the periods indicated, derived from
the financial statements of Be Group presented in accordance with IFRS. Please see “Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information” and_ “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—
_The financial information of Be included in this Offering Memorandum, on a stand-alone basis and_
_combined with the financial information of the Group, has been derived from Be’s financial statements_
_and has not been prepared by us or audited or reviewed by our auditors; reliance on such information_
_without understanding the limitations described below could lead you to make an incorrect, non-_
_advisable or inadequate investment decision.”_

**Year Ended December 31,**

**(in € million)** **2020** **2021** **2022[(b)]**

Total Revenues .................................................................................... 178.8 235.3 266.3

Adjusted EBITDA[(a)] ............................................................................ 28.4 37.1 42.2

_____________

(a) Be’s EBITDA is defined as the algebraic sum of profit for the period before taxes, earnings (including exchange rate

gains and losses), financial expense and non-monetary items, such as amortization/depreciation, write-downs and
allocations to provisions, even if classified under other items of the income statement. In addition, Be’s EBITDA for the
year ended December 31, 2022, has been further adjusted by €20.2 million representing certain extraordinary/nonrecurring costs incurred by Be in connection with the Be Acquisition, including (i) costs incurred as a result of the
acceleration of certain provisions under Be’s 2020-2022 incentive plan originally due in 2023, which resulted in the
implementation of retention and other incentives for certain key persons as well as other personnel costs (approximately
€8.6 million); and (ii) costs incurred in connection with the assessment of estimated risks relating to certain methods for
the payment of top management compensation, including following certain changes to applicable law and discussions
with the Italian Revenue Agency (approximately €7.3 million). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and
_Industry—We are subject to the risk of litigation, tax and regulatory investigations, quality audits by our customers and_
_other claims.”_

(b) Because Be was consolidated into the Group’s results from September 26, 2022, €67.6 million of Be’s revenues and €9.6

million of Be’s Adjusted EBITDA, representing the portion of revenues and EBITDA generated by Be between
September 26, 2022 and December 31, 2022, were reflected in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements.

Following completion of the Initial Acquisition on September 26, 2022, Be was consolidated into the
Group’s results. As a result, the portion of revenues and EBITDA generated by Be between September
26, 2022 and December 31, 2022 was reflected in our 2022 Audited Financial Statements. See “—
_Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2022 compared with Year Ended December 31,_
_2021.” As a result, the financial condition and results of operations of the Group for the year ended_
December 30, 2022 and, to a greater extent, the future financial condition and results of operations of
the Group may differ from, and not be comparable to, the historical financial condition and results of
operations of the Group presented in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. In addition, as we have integrated a large portion of Be’s product
and solutions portfolio into the offering of our Finance industry vertical, this segment may, as a
consequence, become more important to our overall profitability, compared with prior periods.

In addition, by the end of 2024, we expect to generate approximately €9.5 million of cost savings in
connection with the integration of the Be Group into our business. Once achieved, we expect that these
cost savings will structurally reduce the Group’s cost base going forward. In connection with the
achievement of these synergies, on the basis of management estimates, we expect that we will incur
one-off costs of approximately €5.0 million in 2023 and €10.0 million in 2024. We expect to realize
these cost savings through the following initiatives:

(A) Initiatives consisting of: (i) the optimization of Be’s subcontractor and procurement
relationships, through fee renegotiation by leveraging existing procurement relationships of the
Group, (ii) the optimization of external workforce utilization rates through insourcing initiatives
aimed at increasing the utilization of internal workforce, and (iii) the deployment of nearshoring initiatives (including, for example, in Poland). We estimate that by the end of 2024,
these initiatives will generate aggregate cost savings of approximately €4.0 million;

(B) the optimization and consolidation of the Group’s and Be’s combined real estate footprint and
related costs, including initiatives targeted at (i) the full consolidation of Be’s Rome offices into
the Group’s Rome headquarters, (ii) the partial consolidation of Be’s current Milan offices into
the Group’s new flagship Milan office, and (iii) additional optimization initiatives to be
implemented in further locations with potential footprint overlaps, such as Turin and Vicenza.
We estimate that by the end of 2024, these initiatives will generate aggregate cost savings of
approximately €1.5 million;


-----

(C) the consolidation of the Group’s and Be’s staff and administrative functions (including, among
others, finance functions) along with optimization initiatives aimed at aligning our headcount
structure to our peers. We estimate that by the end of 2024, these initiatives will generate
aggregate cost savings of approximately €3.0 million; and

(D) the reduction of compliance expenses following the Delisting of Be (including, in particular,
legal, auditing and other costs driven by compliance with the listing rules by Borsa Italiana for
the Euronext STAR Milan segment of the Euronext Milan market). We estimate that by the end
of 2024, the Delisting will generate aggregate cost savings of approximately €1.0 million.

In addition, we expect that the ongoing combination of our business with the Be Group will provide
potential upside opportunities for revenue and profitability growth, including by unlocking revenue
synergies and by enabling us to serve as a one-stop-shop for top-tier ITC and consulting services. In
particular, we expect opportunities for revenue synergies to arise from: (i) the cross-selling of Group
proprietary solutions to Be Group customers, particularly in the regulatory and payment areas, and the
cross-selling of Be Group’s design support products on the Group’s installed software platforms, (ii)
the ability to offer end-to-end delivery services on large transformation projects to key banks and (iii)
the increase of our share of captured customer spending, particularly in relation to the amount tier 2
bank institutions and insurance companies regularly devotes to the type of services that we offer (i.e.,
share of wallet), with a view of leveraging a joint new approaching strategy of the Group.

The achievement of the cost savings and synergies described above partly depends on factors that are
outside of our control, and we may be unable to implement some or all of such initiatives and/or generate
the expected benefits therefrom within the expected timeframe or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Business and Industry—We may not realize any or all of the adjustments to Pro Forma_
_Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA included in the Offering Memorandum” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related_
_to the Be Acquisition.”_

We have accounted for the Be Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS,
which will affect the comparability of our future consolidated financial statements with the 2022
Audited Financial Statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. We will apply purchase
accounting adjustments in connection with the Be Acquisition to our financial statements for accounting
periods subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2022. The application of purchase accounting will
result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our balance sheet, which
may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, leasehold rights and software, and different
amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our financial
statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made.

Furthermore, we have incurred a substantial amount of additional indebtedness as a result of the Be
Acquisition. As of December 31, 2022, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, we would have had
total third-party financial indebtedness outstanding in the amount of €1,175.1 million, including €385.0
million representing the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby, €605.0 million
representing the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes, €50.0 million of outstanding debt
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, €38.4 million representing the aggregate principal amount
of our Existing Term Loan, and €96.7 million of other Company indebtedness (including €53.7 million
of Be’s indebtedness). See “Capitalization” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Existing Company Indebtedness.” In addition, following the Existing Revolving Credit Facility_
Increase, we have €195.0 million available for drawing under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility,
of which €50.0 million have been drawn to fund the acquisition of Atlantic Technologies at the end of
2022.

Our indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and
future business opportunities, since a substantial portion our cash flow from operations will be dedicated
to the repayment of our indebtedness, and this may place us at a competitive disadvantage as some of
our competitors are less leveraged.

**_Impact of certain accounting errors_**

In September 2022, we became aware of certain discrepancies between budgeted and final financial
data as of August 2022 relating to the Company’s Finance industry vertical and its subsidiary Nexen
(which is part of the Finance industry vertical). As a result of such discrepancies, we initiated a process,
with the assistance from external advisors, in order to verify the accounting methods used for specific
jobs within the Company’s Finance industry vertical and Nexen.

This verification process, which was completed at the end of the fiscal year 2022, identified certain
accounting errors relating to the 2022 fiscal year and previous fiscal years, which resulted in an
overstatement of the Company’s consolidated balance sheet assets and operating profits. On this basis,
management determined that it was necessary to make certain corrections to the financial statements
and applied IAS 8 (Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors), which governs,
among other things, how to recognise and represent errors, including those from previous years.

Based on the results of the verification process, we quantified the following accounting effects:

(i) an overstatement of the Group’s operating profit and EBITDA for the year ended December

31, 2022, of €10.9 million; and

(ii) an overstatement of the balance sheet assets as of January 1, 2022 of €46.0 million.

While it was possible to allocate the effects of the accounting errors that occurred during 2022 to the
financial year ended December 31, 2022 due to the availability of current information on the progress
of the Finance industry vertical’s contracts, we were not able to allocate with certainty the €46.0 million
overstatement of balance sheet assets as of January 1, 2022 to any prior periods because of the way our
management systems close out jobs and of the lack of traceability inside the system for such an
accounting error.

With respect to the accounting treatment of the correction of errors relating to fiscal year 2022, these
were corrected prior to the approval of the 2022 Audited Financial Statements, as required by IAS 8
(par. 5), according to which “potential errors of the current financial year discovered in the same
_financial year shall be corrected before the publication of the financial statements is authorised.”_
Therefore, we corrected the relevant items in the income statement for the year ended December 31,
2022, generating a corresponding impact on the operating profit and EBITDA, which was rectified by
€10.9 million.

Following completion of the verification process carried out with respect to the Finance industry
vertical, we deemed it prudent to carry out further verification processes on all the other verticals of the
Company with the assistance of external advisors whose work was completed by the end of 2022. As
of the date of this Offering Memorandum, no incorrect accounting practices similar to those uncovered
in the Company’s Finance industry vertical and Nexen were identified. However, as a result of such
verification process, we prudentially made specific provisions of approximately €7.0 million (of which
€6.1 million relating to contract work in progress and €0.9 million to invoices to be issued) in our
balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, in respect of some positions relating to assets accrued mainly
in previous years and not invoiced, exclusively attributable to technical/commercial issues that emerged
during the execution of the jobs. Such €7.0 million provisions did not impact our consolidated EBITDA
for the year ended December 31, 2022.

As a result of the correction of the accounting errors in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements as
summarized above and the inability of the Issuer to quantify the above-mentioned corrections on net
income and shareholders’ equity for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the consolidated
financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 contained in the 2022 Audited
Financial Statements included in the Offering Memorandum is not fully comparable with (i) the
financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the 2022 Audited


-----

Financial Statements and the 2021 Financial Statements, and (ii) the financial information as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2020 derived from the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements. For the
same reasons, the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 derived from
the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements is also not fully comparable with the financial information
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and
the 2021 Financial Statements. Neither the 2021 Financial Statements nor the Company’s 2020
Financial Statements are included in the Offering Memorandum.

As a consequence of the foregoing, throughout this Offering Memorandum, we have either marked any
such consolidated financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021,
including any related averages, ranges and growth rates, with an asterisk (“*”) or we have included
appropriate footnotes to the relevant financial tables as a reminder that each such financial information
may be affected by accounting errors. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing our
results of operations and balance sheet assets among the periods under review in this Offering
Memorandum, and in particular those relating to our Finance industry vertical.

Following the identification of the accounting errors described above, we have implemented what we
believe to be adequate changes to reinforce our internal control systems as well as oversight mechanisms
to prevent the implementation of similar accounting errors. The measures we deployed include: (i) an
intensified monitoring of our invoice cycle, (ii) the enhanced supervision of sales functions at each
industry vertical, (iii) the implementation of a new credit monitoring procedure, and (iv) the
centralization of internal control and risk functions previously performed by each industry vertical
independently. We also created a new “order management” function and strengthened our internal
control team, including by appointing a new credit manager.

_Business and Industry—We identified certain accounting errors relating to 2022 and previous fiscal_
_years, which resulted in an overstatement of the Company’s consolidated balance sheet assets and_
_operating profits, and the independent report to the 2022 Audited Financial Statements included in the_
_Offering Memorandum includes an emphasis of matter paragraph in relation to such errors due to our_
_inability to allocate their effects to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2022. Investors should_
_therefore exercise caution when comparing our results of operations and balance sheet assets among_
_the periods under review in this Offering Memorandum, and in particular those relating to our Finance_

_Revenues_

Revenues increased by €124.6 million, or 9.6%, from €1,298.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 to €1,422.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was due to an increase
in sales of services and products across almost all our six industry vertical and, in particular, in our
Industry & Services, Health and Public Administration verticals. Our organic revenue growth from the
year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2022 was 4.0%.

Revenues in the Finance industry vertical increased by €12.6 million, or 4.5%, from €279.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021 to €291.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This
increase was primarily due to the consolidation of the Be Group (€62.6 million) into our results, which
were offset by the impact of the internal investigation regarding the accounting errors described under
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors.”

Revenues in the Health industry vertical increased by €18.9 million, or 19.3%, from €98.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021 to €117.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This
increase was primarily due to higher sales to key Italian customers and the start of new projects we have
been awarded during the second half of 2022.

Revenues in the Industry & Services industry vertical increased by €82.0 million, or 28.0%, from €292.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €374.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.


-----

This increase was primarily due to the consolidation into our results of PluSure S.p.A., the Movilitas
Group and Design Automation Associates Inc. and to higher sales in Italy driven by the inception of
new projects for key customers.

Revenues in the Telco & Media industry vertical decreased by €18.4 million, or 13.8%, from €133.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €115.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
This decrease was primarily due to lower sales from certain key customers, mainly driven by lower
sales to Telecom Italia and, to a lesser extent, Vodafone, BT and Median SIAE, partly offset by an
increase in sales towards Telco & Media customers in South America.

Revenues in the Energy & Utilities industry vertical increased by €10.6 million, or 5.3%, from €198.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €209.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of Proprietary Solutions products, as well as an
increase in sales volumes driven by the inception of new projects with key customers.

Revenues in the Public Administration industry vertical increased by €18.9 million, or 6.4%, from
€296.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €314.9 million for the year ended December
31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to a general increase in sales primarily driven by tenders
awarded by CONSIP and by public administration entities in the welfare sector.

_Raw materials and consumables_

Cost of raw materials and consumables increased by €23.2 million, or 66.1%, from €35.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021 to €58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase
was primarily due to a €13.0 million increase in costs related to the resale of software products and a
€10.2 million increase in raw materials costs. Cost of raw materials and consumables accounted for
4.1% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with 2.7% of our revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Service costs_

Service costs increased by €65.2 million, or 14.8%, from €440.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 to €505.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to a
€17.5 million increase in costs related to external IT consultants and a €22.6 million increase in legal
and administrative consultancy costs, both driven by the combined effect of an increase in revenues and
the expansion of our consolidation perimeter. Service costs accounted for 35.6% of our revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with 33.9% of our revenues for the year ended December
31, 2021.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs increased by €44.3 million, or 6.6%, from €674.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 to €718.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to
the combined effect of workforce salary increases and higher provisions for unused holidays and leave
periods. Personnel costs accounted for 50.5% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022,
compared with 52.0% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Amortization and depreciation_

Amortization and depreciation increased by €6.2 million, or 6.5%, from €96.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was
primarily due to the combined effect of a €5.2 million decrease in customer relationship amortization
costs and a €1.0 million decrease in amortization costs relating to the implementation of the IFRS 16
accounting standard, both partly offset by a €0.1 million increase in amortization costs relating to
intangible assets. Amortization and depreciation costs accounted for 7.2% of our revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2022, compared with 7.5% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.


-----

_Provisions_

Provisions increased by €27.8 million, or 122.5%, from €22.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2021 to €50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to a €22.1
million increase in allocations to allowance for bad debt, and a €4.9 million increase in allocations to
risk provisions. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” Provisions accounted for 3.5% of our revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1.7% of our revenues for the year ended December
31, 2021.

_Other costs_

Other costs decreased by €10.6 million, or (43.3)%, from €24.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 to €13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to
the combined effect of a €4.5 million decrease in taxes other than income tax and a €6.8 million decrease
in other costs (driven by certain one-off costs incurred by our subsidiaries D.HUB and Cybertech),
partly offset by a €0.4 million increase in costs relating to dues and subscriptions. Other costs accounted
for 1.0% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1.9% of our revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Financial income_

Financial income decreased by €0.5 million, or (4.7)%, from €10.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 to €10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was mainly due to the
combined effect of a €5.1 million increase in income from exchange difference gains, offset by a €0.4
million decrease in fair value gains. and a €5.2 million decrease in interest income from receivables
towards Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Sicilia, both relating to unpaid invoices.

_Financial expenses_

Financial expenses increased by €19.2 million, or 26.7%, from €71.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €91.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily
due to the combined effect of a €8.2 million increase in expenses from foreign exchange losses and a
€11.0 million increase in interest expenses on the €210.0 million deeply subordinated shareholder loan
granted by TopCo to the Issuer in 2020, in connection with the Engineering Acquisition.

_Income taxes_

Income taxes increased by €13.7 million, or 214.1%, from a credit of €6.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to a credit of €20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase
was primarily due to a €8.2 million increase in deferred taxes, driven by the accrual of tax loss advances
by our subsidiary D.HUB.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €9.5 million, or 4.8%, from €198.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €207.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was
primarily due to the combined effect of (i) increased sales and higher margins reported by our Public
Administration, Healthcare, Energy & Utilities and Industry & Services industry verticals, and (ii) the
consolidation into our results of revenues contributed by acquisitions we completed over the year ended
December 31, 2022, partly offset by a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Finance and
Telco & Media industry verticals.

(a) For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in

Adjusted EBITDA in the Finance industry vertical decreased by €16.2 million, or (22.1)%, from €73.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
This increase was primarily due to the impact of the internal investigation regarding the accounting
errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors,” partly
offset by the acquisition of Be, which has been consolidated into our results starting from October 1,
2022.

Adjusted EBITDA in the Health industry vertical increased by €5.1 million, or 24.9%, from €20.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to €25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
This increase was primarily due to the increased sales volumes of proprietary products and higher
profitability of projects we managed in 2022.

Adjusted EBITDA in the Industry & Services industry vertical increased by €12.6 million, or 42.9%,
from €29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €42.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the combined effect of (i) higher sales margins by our
Italian and U.S. subsidiaries and (ii) the acquisitions of PluSure S.p.A., the Movilitas Group and Design
Automation Associates, Inc..

Adjusted EBITDA in the Telco & Media industry vertical decreased by €1.7 million, or (13.0)%, from
€13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €11.4 million for the year ended December 31,


-----

2022. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes and lower sales margins generated from
sales to certain telecommunications operators, partly offset by internal efficiencies.

Adjusted EBITDA in the Energy & Utilities industry vertical increased by €3.3 million, or 13.1%, from
€25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €28.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2022. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of Proprietary Solutions products and the
inception of new projects with key customers.

Adjusted EBITDA in the Public Administration industry vertical increased by €6.4 million, or 17.3%,
from €36.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €43.3 million for the year ended December
31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to increased sales driven by the award of tenders and higher
profitability of projects managed during the period.

- The statement of consolidated income information for the year ended December 31, 2020, presented in the comparative
column of the 2021 Financial Statements (which are not included in this Offering Memorandum): (i) approximately seven
months of operations of the Issuer only, without any results from the Group prior to the Engineering Acquisition Closing
Date, and (ii) approximately five months of operations of the Group after the Engineering Acquisition Closing Date. As
a result, to enhance comparability of our results between the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, in the table above
we present the consolidated cash flow statement information of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2020
derived from the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements (which are not included in this Offering Memorandum) in
comparison to the Issuer’s consolidated cash flow statement information for the year ended December 31, 2021, derived
from the 2022 Audited Financial Statements. Given the different scope of consolidation of the Issuer and the Company,
the results of operation of the Company and the Issuer are not directly comparable. See “—Key Factors Affecting the
_Comparability of Our Results of Operations—The Engineering Acquisition in 2020” for a discussion of key differences_
between the financial results of the Issuer and of the Company. See also “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information” for further information._

errors to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2022, the financial information for the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2020 presented in the table above is impacted by the accounting errors described under “Presentation of

_Revenues_

Revenues increased by €79.5 million, or 6.5%, from €1,218.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 to €1,298.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an
increase in sales of services and products across all our six industry verticals, including as a result of
the recovery of the economy on the back of the measures adopted in response to the COVID-19
pandemic (such as the PNRR) and, in particular, the Industry & Services industry vertical, as well as
the full consolidation into our results of new companies and businesses acquired, in particular the
Movilitas group. Excluding revenues generated by our mobile payments business, our revenues in the
year ended December 31, 2021, would have been €1,296.4 million, an increase of €87.2 million (or
7.2%) compared to €1,209.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Our organic revenue growth
from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021 was 6.4%.

See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Our Industry Verticals and Activities.”

Revenues in the Finance industry vertical increased by €4.5 million, or 1.6%, from €274.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 to €279.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This
increase was primarily due to increased revenues from our key customers, such as UniCredit and BNPP,
as well as the inception of new customer projects with Intesa Sanpaolo following its acquisition of UBI,
partly offset by a decrease in sales of third-party licenses.

Revenues in the Health industry vertical increased by €19.8 million, or 25.3%, from €78.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 to €98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase
was primarily due to revenues generated by new contracts won with multiple Italian Regions and
additional healthcare investments by existing customers in the context of the outbreak of COVID-19.

Revenues in the Industry & Services industry vertical increased by €31.8 million, or 12.2%, from €261.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €292.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
This increase was primarily due to (i) increased sales in the United States following our acquisition of
Design Automation Associates Inc., (ii) increased sales driven by our eXcellence global division and
(iii) a global macroeconomic recovery from COVID-19 positively impacting customers in the
automotive and transportation sectors.

Revenues in the Telco & Media industry vertical increased by €2.8 million, or 2.1%, from €130.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €133.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
This increase was primarily due to revenues generated by new contracts with major telecommunications
companies. Excluding revenues generated by our mobile payments business, revenues in our Telco &
Media industry vertical in the year ended December 31, 2021, would have been €131.9 million, an
increase of €10.5 million (or 8.7%) compared to €121.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Revenues in the Energy & Utilities industry vertical increased by €2.1 million, or 1.1%, from €196.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €198.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
This increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes driven by our Net@Suite solution and increased
revenues from ENEL.

Revenues in the Public Administration industry vertical increased by €18.6 million, or 6.7%, from
€277.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €296.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to revenues from the award of new contracts by central
governmental agencies and local entities, as a consequence of successful tenders.

_Raw materials and consumables_

Cost of raw materials and consumables decreased by €4.5 million, or 11.4%, from €39.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 to €35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease
was primarily due to a decrease of €6.8 million in costs associated with the resale of software products,
from €32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €25.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2021, which was driven by our operating performance for the period. Cost of raw materials and
consumables accounted for 3.2% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to
2.7% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.


-----

_Service costs_

Service costs increased by €47.0 million, or 11.9%, from €393.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 to €440.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to a
€41.2 million increase in costs for technical support and consultancy, driven by the increase in revenues
over the same period that required the support of resources external to the Group. Service costs
accounted for 32.3% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 33.9% of
our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs increased by €36.8 million, or 5.8%, from €637.8 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 to €674.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was due primarily to a
reduced use of extraordinary government benefits and compensation schemes in the context of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Personnel costs accounted for 52.3% of our revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2020, compared with 52.0% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Amortization and depreciation_

Amortization and depreciation increased by €35.7 million, or 58.4%, from €61.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 to €96.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was
primarily due to (i) an increased amortization of intangible assets driven by the recognition of customer
lists and relationships on our balance sheet as a result of the purchase price allocation for acquisitions
completed over the period and (ii) and a €0.9 million decrease in amortization costs relating to the
impact of the implementation of the IFRS 16 accounting standard from €19.7 million in 2020 to €18.8
million in 2021. Amortization and depreciation accounted for 5.0% of our revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2020, compared with 7.5% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Provisions_

Provisions increased by €14.0 million, or 160.9%, from €8.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 to €22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to
increased allocations to bad debt provisions due to the write-off of receivables owed by Sicilia e-Servizi
Venture S.c. à r.l. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” Provisions accounted for 0.7% of our revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 1.7% of our revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2021.

_Other costs_

Other costs increased by €14.0 million, or 133.3%, from €10.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 to €24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to fines
incurred in connection with a reassessment of past income taxes (€4.8 million) and transaction costs
accounted in connection with the acquisition of the 49% minority shareholding in our subsidiary
Cybertech. Other costs accounted for 0.9% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020,
compared with 1.9% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Financial income_

Financial income increased by €3.3 million, or 45.2%, from €7.3 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 to €10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to
increased gains on exchange differences driven by fluctuations in exchange rates.

_Financial expenses_

Financial expenses increased by €55.9 million, or 349.4%, from €16.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 to €71.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily


-----

due to €58.2 million increased interest expenses, which amounted to €66.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021, compared to €8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by interest
payments over the period for borrowings by the Issuer under the Existing Notes and the Existing Term
Loan, as opposed to lower interest payments made by the Company for the year ended December 31,
2020, reflecting a lower level of Group indebtedness prior to the consummation of the Engineering
Acquisition.

_Income taxes_

Income taxes increased by €94.2 million, or 93.6%, from a credit of €100.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 to a credit of €6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This tax credit
decrease was primarily due to the extraordinary release to the income statement for the year ended
December 31, 2020, of deferred tax liabilities relating to trademarks and other intangible assets, which
was driven by the realignment of the higher value relating to business assets and equity investments
resulting from the financial information for the year ended December 31, 2019, pursuant to Law Decree
no. 104 of 14 August 2020, converted into Law no. 126 of 13 October 2020, and Law no. 178 of 30
December 2020.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €21.0 million, or 11.8%, from €177.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 to €198.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was
primarily due to positive performance across our Finance, Industry & Services and Health industry
verticals, partly offset by underperformance in our Energy & Utilities industry vertical, compared to the
year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, excluding Adjusted EBITDA generated by our mobile
payments business, our Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2021, would have been
€198.7 million, an increase of €21.7 million (or 12.3%) compared to €176.9 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020.

See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Our Industry Verticals and Activities.”

Adjusted EBITDA in the Finance industry vertical increased by €9.8 million, or 15.5%, from €63.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €73.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
This increase was primarily due to the combined effect of increased sales of Proprietary Solutions
products and a lower volume of sales driven by third-party licenses.

Adjusted EBITDA in the Health industry vertical increased by €4.2 million, or 25.8%, from €16.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
This increase was primarily due to increased sales volumes driving higher margins.

Adjusted EBITDA in the Industry & Services industry vertical increased by €4.9 million, or 20.2%,
from €24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €29.2 million for the year ended December
31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to increased efficiency in managing indirect costs and an
increase in sales driven by the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Adjusted EBITDA in the Telco & Media industry vertical increased by €2.2 million, or 20.2%, from
€10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €13.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2021. This increase was primarily due to higher sales margins driven by increased sales to key
customers, partly offset by a decrease in revenues from our mobile payments business. In addition,
Adjusted EBITDA generated from our mobile payments business decreased from €0.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 to negative €0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a
result of the ongoing revenue reduction resulting from restrictions imposed by the competent Italian
authorities on the use of services through such platform by such mobile operators. Excluding Adjusted
EBITDA generated by our mobile payments business, Adjusted EBITDA in our Telco & Media
industry vertical in the year ended December 31, 2021, would have been €13.5 million, an increase of
€3.1 million (or 28.9%) compared to €10.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Adjusted EBITDA in the Energy & Utilities industry vertical decreased by €4.1 million, or 14.0%, from
€29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €25.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2021. This increase was primarily due to the impact of certain one-off costs recorded on certain
customer projects.

Adjusted EBITDA in the Public Administration industry vertical increased by €3.8 million, or 11.5%,
from €33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €36.9 million for the year ended December
31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales volumes by our subsidiary Municipia,
driven by a rebound of its tax management business following the recovery from the COVID-19
pandemic.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Overview_**

Historically, the principal sources of our liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities and
bank credit lines, as well as the Existing Revolving Credit Facility since July 10, 2020. In addition, we
engage in the sale of receivables on the basis of uncommitted or committed framework non-recourse
factoring agreements in order to support our working capital and liquidity needs.

On or about September 29, 2022, certain lenders made available an additional facility under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in a principal amount of €35.0 million by way of a fungible


-----

increase of the total commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility to €195.0 million. See
“Summary—The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Increase,” and “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Existing Revolving Facility Agreement.” At the end of 2022 we drew €50.0 million_
under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of Atlantic Technologies, which
are outstanding as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. From time to time, we may borrow
amounts under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, among other things, to repay a portion of Be’s
existing indebtedness.

Moreover, we recently revised our prior policy of mainly resorting to spot sales of trade receivables on
a non-recourse basis to support our liquidity needs and, in March 2022, we entered into the First Intesa
Securitization Program, consisting of a new committed framework factoring agreement with a vehicle
controlled by Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. providing for non-recourse sales of receivables for an aggregate
amount of up to €150.0 million at any time outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, €110.7 million were
outstanding under the First Intesa Securitization Program, while €39.3 million were available for
drawing. In addition, in October 2021 we entered into the Second Intesa Securitization Program, which
provides for the non-recourse sales of receivables from Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. For the year ended
December 31, 2022, we have sold €122.6 million trade receivables under the Second Intesa
Securitization Program. See “Description of Certain Other Financing Arrangements—Existing
_Company Indebtedness—Intesa Securitization Programs.” We intend to primarily rely on our operating_
cash flow and on sales of receivables under our Intesa Securitization Programs and on a spot basis, as
well as our Existing Revolving Credit Facility to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity needs
going forward.

As a result of sales of receivables under the Intesa Securitization Programs and other spot sales of
receivables, as of December 31, 2022, as part of our receivables management strategy and to support
our M&A activity we sold €787.8 million of trade receivables on a non-recourse basis, €133.3 million
of which were still outstanding at period end (excluding €121.2 million of trade receivables sold on a
non-recourse basis by Be, €39.6 million of which were still outstanding as of December 31, 2022).

Historically, our principal uses of cash have been, and we expect that our principal uses of cash
following the Transactions will be, to fund capital expenditures, provide working capital, meet debt
service requirements, fund our add-on acquisitions, including funding the payment of earn outs and the
exercise of certain put and call options related to our acquired subsidiaries that have minority
shareholders. We believe that the current cash flow from operating activities and existing bank financing
will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet current working capital needs.

Our ability to generate sufficient cash for our debt service depends on our operating performance and
liquidity and on the operating performance and liquidity of our subsidiaries, which in turn depends to a
certain extent on general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors, many of which are
beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors.”

- The consolidated cash flow statement information for the year ended December 31, 2020, presented in the comparative
column of the 2021 Financial Statements (which are not included in this Offering Memorandum) include: (i)
approximately seven months of operations of the Issuer only, without any results from the Group prior to the Engineering
Acquisition Closing Date, and (ii) approximately five months of operations of the Group after the Engineering Acquisition
Closing Date. As a result, to enhance comparability of our results between the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021,
in the table above we present the consolidated cash flow statement information of the Company for the year ended
December 31, 2020 derived from the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements (which are not included in this Offering
Memorandum) in comparison to the Issuer’s consolidated cash flow statement information for the year ended December
31, 2021, derived from the 2022 Audited Financial Statements. Given the different scope of consolidation of the Issuer
and the Company, the results of operation of the Company and the Issuer are not directly comparable. See “—Key Factors
_Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—The Engineering Acquisition in 2020” for a discussion of key_
differences between the financial results of the Issuer and of the Company. See also “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information” for further information._

(a) As a result of the correction of the accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—

_Accounting Errors” in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the inability of the Issuer to allocate the effects of such_
errors to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2022, the consolidated financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2022 extracted from the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and presented in the table above is not fully
comparable with (i) the financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021 derived from the 2022 Audited
Financial Statements, and (ii) the financial information for the year ended December 31, 2020 derived from the
Company’s 2020 Financial Statements, in each case, presented in the table above. For the same reasons, the financial
information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 derived from the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements is
also not fully comparable with the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the
2022 Audited Financial Statements and the 2021 Financial Statements. In particular, the financial information for the
years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 presented in the table above is impacted by the accounting errors described
under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors,” and therefore you should not place undue
reliance on such information. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We identified certain
_accounting errors relating to 2022 and previous fiscal years, which resulted in an overstatement of the Company’s_
_consolidated balance sheet assets and operating profits, and the independent report to the 2022 Audited Financial_
_Statements included in the Offering Memorandum includes an emphasis of matter paragraph in relation to such errors_
_due to our inability to allocate their effects to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2022. Investors should_
_therefore exercise caution when comparing our results of operations and balance sheet assets among the periods under_
_review in this Offering Memorandum, and in particular those relating to our Finance industry vertical.”_

_Total cash flow from / (used in) operating activities_

Total cash flow from operating activities increased by €120.9 million, or 81.3%, from an inflow of
€148.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to an inflow of €269.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the higher cash collected from the sale of
products and services to third parties, partly offset by higher cash paid for goods and services and for
personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 with were driven by the combined effect of
organic revenue growth and the consolidation of the Be Group and Atlantic Technologies.

Total cash flow from operating activities increased by €81.6 million, or 121.4%, from an inflow €67.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to an inflow of €148.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher cash collected from the sale of products
and services to third parties as a result of a recovery from COVID-19, partially offset by cash paid for
personnel costs and goods and services.

_Total cash flow from / (used in) investing activities_

Total cash flow used in investing activities increased by €428.8 million, or 463.7%, from an outflow
€93.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to an outflow of €524.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to increased purchase of intangible assets and to
consideration paid for acquisitions.

Total cash flow used in investing activities increased by €57.7 million, or 163.1%, from an outflow of
€35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to an outflow of €93.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. This increase in outflow was primarily due to higher consideration paid for
acquisitions and increased purchase of intangible assets.

_Total cash flow from / (used in) financing activities_

Total cash flow from financing activities increased by €380.9 million, or 1,170.8%, from an outflow of
€32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to an inflow of €348.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. This increase in inflow was primarily due to the increase in borrowings under new
loans, which offset the increase in the repayment of borrowings.

Total cash flow used in financing activities decreased by €49.1 million, or 60.1%, from an outflow of
€81.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to an outflow of €32.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. This decrease in outflow was primarily due to a decrease in the repayment of
borrowings.

**_Net Working Capital_**

Net Working Capital represents customer contract assets, inventory, deferred contract costs, trade
receivables and other current assets less trade payables, other current liabilities, current tax payables
and current provision for risks and charges. Net Working Capital is not a measure of net income,
operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with IFRS. When
assessing our operating performance, you should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for


-----

our net income, operating income or any other operating performance or liquidity measure that is
calculated in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS
_Measures.”_

Change in Net Working Capital represents the difference in Net Working Capital as of the specified
date compared to Net Working Capital as of the comparable prior date. Our Net Working Capital results
are affected by seasonality, with our Net Working Capital levels typically peaking in September of each
year, reflecting our revenue generation pattern, before gradually declining to their low point in
December of each year.

Trade receivables are initially recognized at transaction price, adjusted for directly attributable
transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method
(i.e., the rate that equalizes the current value of expected cash flows and the carrying amount at the time
of initial recognition), suitably adjusted to take account of any write-downs, by recording a doubtful
debt provision. Trade receivables are included in current assets, with the exception of those falling due
more than twelve months after the reporting date, which are classified as non-current assets. At each
reporting date, financial assets, with the exception of those measured at fair value with a contra-entry
recognized in the income statement, are analyzed to assess the existence of any possible impairment
indicators. IFRS 9 requires the application of a model based on expected losses on receivables. We
apply the simplified approach to estimate expected losses along the receivable useful life and take into
account its historical experience of losses on receivables, adjusted to reflect current conditions and
estimates of future economic conditions. For trade receivables recorded at amortized cost, when an
impairment has been identified, the relevant value is measured as the difference between the asset book
value and the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest
rate. This value is recognized in the income statement. Receivables sold under our uncommitted
framework non-recourse factoring agreements, pursuant to which the final transfer to the transferee is
carried out in relation to risks and benefits of factored receivables, are derecognized from the financial
statements upon their transfer. See also “—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.”

Deferred contract costs represent only costs considered ‘incremental’ and recoverable through the
economic benefits of the contract, in accordance with IFRS 15. Costs that cannot be classified as
‘incremental’, such as costs incurred independently and not related to the acquisition of the contract,
are expensed in the income statement.

We mitigate our exposure to the risks relating to the collection of receivables through constant
monitoring of our commercial exposure and the collection times of receivables, which we track
excluding the effect of non-recourse sales of receivables. For example, we have a dedicated team
focused on receivables collection and our sales representatives’ variable bonus includes DSO annual
targets. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Market and Financial Risks—Credit
_Risk.” Excluding the effect of non-recourse sales of receivables, our DSOs in trade receivables_
decreased from 219 days as of December 31, 2021 to 195 days as of December 31, 2022, due to the
combined effect of organic revenue growth and higher collection of outstanding invoices. Including the
effect of non-recourse sales of receivables, our DSOs in trade receivables were 163 days as of December
31, 2022.

- As a result of the correction of the accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—
_Accounting Errors” in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the inability of the Issuer to allocate the effects of such_
errors to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2022, the consolidated financial information as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2022 extracted from the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and presented in the table above is not
fully comparable with (i) the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 derived from the 2022
Audited Financial Statements, and (ii) the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 derived
from the Company’s 2020 Financial Statements, in each case, presented in the table above. For the same reasons, the
financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 derived from the Company’s 2020 Financial
Statements is also not fully comparable with the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021
included in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements and the 2021 Financial Statements. In particular, the financial
information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 presented in the table above is impacted by the
accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors,” and therefore
you should not place undue reliance on such information. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and

_vertical.”_

(a) The following adjustments remove the effects on our net working capital of certain non-cash and other charges, which we do not

believe to be indicative of operational changes in our net working capital. In particular, we have adjusted our net working capital to
remove the effects of our ongoing dispute with Sicilia Digitale and Regione Siciliana on our trade receivables and trade payables,
which we deem not to be representative of the changes in our net working capital as a result of our operations. See also “Business—
_Legal Proceedings.”_

(b) Other adjustments represents non-cash items affecting Net Working Capital for the year ended December 31, 2022, including (i) an

overstatement of balance sheet assets as of January 1, 2022 of €46.0 million, (ii) specific provisions made for €7.0 million on some
positions relating to assets accrued mainly in previous years and not invoiced (both (i) and (ii) being incurred in connection with the
accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors”), and (iii) generic
provisions made for €22.8 million in connection with the adoption of a new receivables policy.

(c) Change in adjusted net working capital represents the difference in adjusted net working capital as of the specified date compared to

adjusted net working capital as of the comparable prior date.

Net working capital and adjusted net working capital are not measures of net income, operating income, operating performance or
liquidity presented in accordance with IFRS. When assessing our operating performance, you should not consider this data in isolation
or as a substitute for our net income, operating income or any other operating performance or liquidity measure that is calculated in
accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures.”

Net working capital decreased by €188.4 million, or (65.1)%, from €289.5 million as of December 31,
2021 to €100.9 million as of December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to (i) a reduction in
trade receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2022, compared to trade receivables outstanding as
of December 31, 2021 of €79.3 million, and (ii) an increase in trade payables as of December 31, 2022,
compared to trade payables as of December 31, 2021 as a result of €64.1 million. Our Net Working
Capital as of December 31, 2022 included €40.9 million from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione
Sicilia, compared to €59.8 million as of December 31, 2021 (see “Business—Legal Proceedings”). We
did not experience any slowdown in our ability to collect cash from our customers in the year ended
December 31, 2022.

Net working capital decreased by €51.4 million, or 15.0%, from €340.9 million as of December 31,
2020 to €289.5 million as of December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in
trade payables as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, partly offset by an increase
in customer contract assets and an increase in other current assets as of December 31, 2021, compared
to December 31, 2020. Our Net Working Capital as of December 31, 2021 included €59.8 million from
Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Regione Sicilia, compared to €59.4 million as of December 31, 2020 (see
“Business—Legal Proceedings”).

**_Capital expenditure_**

Capital expenditure consists of investments in property, plant and equipment, plus investments in
intangible assets. Historically, our capital expenditure has been primarily related to investments in
property, plant and equipment, such as ordinary maintenance capital expenditures for our three data
centers. Capital expenditures excludes the consideration paid by us for the acquisition of other
businesses. See “Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Acquisitions.”
We finance our capital expenditure with cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities.
Capital expenditures is not a measure of net income, operating income, operating performance or
liquidity presented in accordance with IFRS. When assessing our operating performance, you should
not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income, operating income or any other
operating performance or liquidity measure that is calculated in accordance with IFRS. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures.”

Capital expenditure increased by €31.3 million, or 134.3%, from €23.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily
due to increased capital expenditure for the purchase of intangible assets driven by additional
investments in our proprietary solutions across our industry verticals, as well as the integration of Be
into our results.

Capital expenditure increased by €7.8 million, or 50.3%, from €15.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 to €23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily
due to higher capital expenditure for intangible assets (due to the capitalization of R&D costs) and lower
capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment, reflecting the increased focus on the development
of proprietary solutions.


-----

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we expect our capital expenditure for the year ending
December 31, 2023 to be higher than that incurred in the year ended December 31, 2022 mainly as a
result of a sustained growth of investments in our proprietary solutions, supported by an increase in
investments in hardware products and managed operations, and the Be Acquisition. See “Forward_Looking Statements.”_

**Lease Commitments**

In accordance with IFRS 16, right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any
remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the
lease payments not being paid at that date. Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted for interest and
lease payments, including for the impact of lease modifications. The carrying amount of current and
non-current lease liabilities amounted to €168.9 million, €142.9 million and €157.4 million as of
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, such reduction being driven by annual lease payments
made by the Group. For further information, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and
“Capitalization.”

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

Certain of the contracts with our customers include a product lifetime warranty. As a consequence, in
case of product defects we could incur warranty costs and be required to make indemnity payments to
our customers.

Indemnification accruals in relation to these contracts are based on estimates that can change over time.
In addition, we have entered into certain off-balance sheet exchange rate and guarantee arrangements.
In addition, we also provide certain guarantees with respect to our participation in tender offers, the
entry into certain contracts and in relation to office rental agreements. Such guarantees amounted to
€499.4 million as of December 31, 2022. We also provide bank sureties in favor of other companies
which amounted to €11.1 million as of December 31, 2022 as well as other performance bonds and
other commitments relating our participation in public tenders (so called “bid bonds”), which amounted
to €79.1 million as of December 31, 2022. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and
_Industry—We may be unable to obtain the bid bonds, performance bonds, securities or guarantees we_
_need to compete in certain public tenders or to enter into certain contracts with our private customers,_
_and due to our failure to perform our obligations, counterparties may enforce bid and performance_
_bonds we have posted.”_

Certain minority shareholders of some of our subsidiaries have contractual arrangements with the Group
pursuant to which they may, following the exercise of put options under such contractual arrangements
and subject to certain conditions and timing requirements, require the Group to purchase their minority
stake. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of our liabilities in connection with such put
options amounted to €2.6 million, in addition to €14.9 million in respect of earn-out liabilities.
Moreover, as of December 31, 2022, Be’s overall liability with respect to put and call options amounted
to €13.5 million (on a discounted basis). The fair value of such liabilities was determined based on the
terms of the contractual arrangements with our relevant minority shareholder.

Historically, we have engaged in the sale of receivables on the basis of uncommitted framework nonrecourse factoring agreements in order to support our working capital and liquidity needs. Typically,
receivables factored through non-recourse factoring transactions are written off from our financial
statements upon their transfer, as all risks and benefits of the factored receivables are irrevocably
transferred to the transferee. As of December 31, 2022, we sold €787.8 million of trade receivables on
a non-recourse basis, €133.3 million of which were still outstanding at period end (excluding €121.2
million of trade receivables sold on a non-recourse basis by Be, €39.6 million of which were still
outstanding as of December 31, 2022). Recently, we revised our prior policy of mainly resorting to spot
sales of trade receivables on a non-recourse basis to support our liquidity needs and, in March 2022, we


-----

entered into the First Intesa Securitization Program, consisting of a new committed framework factoring
agreement with a vehicle controlled by Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. providing for non-recourse sales of
receivables for an aggregate amount of up to €150.0 million at any time outstanding. As of December
31, 2022, €110.7 million were outstanding under the First Intesa Securitization Program, while €39.3
million were available for drawing. In addition, in October 2021 we entered into the Second Intesa
Securitization Program, which provides for the non-recourse sales of receivables from Intesa Sanpaolo
S.p.A. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we have sold €122.6 million trade receivables under the
Second Intesa Securitization Program. See “Description of Certain Other Financing Arrangements—
_Existing Company Indebtedness—Intesa Securitization Programs.”_

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Market and Financial Risks**

**_Overview_**

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and
capital risk. Our risk management strategy is aimed at minimizing potential effects on our financial
performance. Risk management is centralized in our Finance Department.

This discussion does not address other risks to which we are exposed in the ordinary course of business,
such as operational risks. See “Risk Factors.”

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is derived from customer receivables, taking the form of the possibility that the
counterparties to our contracts will not fulfill their contractual obligations. To mitigate credit risk related
to commercial counterparties we have put in place procedures aimed at ensuring that product sales are
made to customers who are deemed reliable due to, for example, their high creditworthiness. Credit risk
is further mitigated through constant monitoring of our commercial exposure and the collection times
of receivables, including through the implementation of policies aimed at ensuring the solvency of
customers and at limiting excessive exposure to any particular customer at a given time, by means of
tailored evaluation and monitoring activities. For example, we have a dedicated internal team focused
on receivables collection; our sales representatives’ variable bonus includes DSO annual targets in order
to fully align the corporate structure with such targets. In addition, we have historically engaged in the
sale of receivables on the basis of uncommitted framework non-recourse factoring agreements and, in
2021 and 2022, we have entered into the Intesa Securitization Programs. We believe our credit risk
mitigation techniques are effective. Our clients include leading players in their reference market sectors.
As such, we believe that there is limited risk that such operators will face insolvency, bankruptcy or
other administrative procedures. Any financial assets that we consider of doubtful recoverability are
appropriately allocated to the bad debt provisions. As of December 31, 2022 we recorded allowances
for bad debts with respect to receivables from customers of €81.2 million. As of December 31, 2020,
2021 and 2022, we recorded allowances for bad debts with respect to receivables from customers
(including €37.8 million in connection with SISEV and Sicilia Digitale) of €54.7 million, €57.0 million
and €81.2 million, respectively. See “—Net Working Capital.” For more information please refer to the
notes in our 2022 Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk associated with the ability to meet commitments arising from financial
liabilities. Prudent management of the liquidity risk arising from normal operations requires the
maintenance of an adequate level of cash and the availability of funds obtainable through an adequate
amount of credit lines. We further mitigate liquidity risk by centralizing our treasury function (which
allows for efficient resource management) and by ensuring that we have access to different sources of
financing, with different banking institutions and that there are no significant concentrations of liquidity
risk on the side of both financial assets and the sources of financing. To further mitigate any liquidity
risk, we have implemented a cash pooling approach within the Group. Group’s cash is swept to a single
central bank account held by the Company on a daily basis. We aim to balance our mid-to-long term


-----

financial indebtedness with our operations, which are mostly carried out on the short term, in order to
better manage liquidity peaks when due.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Interest risk consists of exposure to the interest rate risk that arises from the fact that currently a portion
of our debt bears floating interest rates. Fluctuations in market interest rates may affect our results,
indirectly affecting costs and returns of financing and investment transactions. After completion of the
Transactions, we will continue to be exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our financial debt
that remains outstanding, the Notes, the Existing Term Loan and any additional borrowings under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility. The strategy that we follow for this type of risk-mitigation is one
that aims at mitigating interest rate risk while optimizing debt cost.

**Accounting Policies**

For a complete summary of our accounting policies, see the 2022 Audited Financial Statements included

**Overview – “Digital is here to stay”**

COVID-19 has accelerated digitalization in nearly all sectors of the Italian economy, influencing
consumer behavior and social interactions and impacting operating practices at both private businesses
and public sector entities. 2020 was a pivotal year for Italy as the spread of the pandemic mandated the
need for technology solutions to enable business continuity and increased corporate and social
awareness of the strategic role that technology plays for the development of the Italian economy. In
2021, the Italian government adopted several measures to catalyze economic recovery post the
downturn caused by COVID-19, including the adoption of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan
(Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza) (“PNRR”). Approved in June 2021 in the wake of the Next
Generation EU, PNRR is an economic recovery package aimed at supporting EU Member States to
recover from the impact of the pandemic at both the European and national level.

The Italian ICT market was estimated at approximately €37.2 billion in the six months ended June 30,
2022, and €75.3 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021, a 3.0% and 5.3% growth compared to
the preceding year periods, respectively. Over the course of the year ended December 31, 2021, and the
year ended December 31, 2022, the Italian market experienced a further increase in the adoption of
digital solutions based on modern technologies that leverage the latest capabilities in digitalization, such
as cloud, big data, artificial intelligence (“AI”), and cybersecurity. Data on investments in digital
technologies indicate that digital ways of working are here to stay. Growth of key digital enabler
technologies such as cloud computing, AI, Blockchain and cybersecurity highlight the momentum of
the sector — between 2022 and 2025, cloud computing, AI, blockchain applications and cybersecurity
are expected to grow by approximately 25%, 21%, approximately 26%, and 14%, respectively.

Following robust recovery in the year ended December 31, 2021, and the year ended December 31,
2022, there has been a marked slowdown in growth globally, which is expected to continue moderating
in the year ended December 31, 2023. According to the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”), global
GDP growth is expected to slow down from 6.3% in the year ended December 31, 2021, and 3.4% in
the year ended December 31, 2022 to 2.8% in the year ended December 31, 2023. Advanced
economies, including Italy, are expected to experience an especially pronounced growth slowdown,
from 3.7% in the year ended December 31, 2022, to 0.7% in the year ended December 31, 2023. In the
year ended December 31, 2022, the development of the Italian digital market reflected this trend. All
sectors were growing in the first six months of 2022 but showed a slower percentage increase than in
the first six months of 2021. The only exception is Network Services, which has had a negative trend
in both semesters. Despite the geopolitical uncertainties as well as inflationary pressure, it is expected
that the digitalization in Italian will continue in the coming years with a renewed impetus to the market,
also supported by the PNRR.

**Characteristics and growth of the Italian ICT market**

The ICT market comprises of five key segments: ICT Services, Software and Solutions, Devices and
Systems, Digital Content and Online Advertising, and Network Services. Within the overall market, we


-----

address the large and faster growing ICT Software & Solutions and ICT Services markets, worth
approximately €22 billion in 2021 (and expected to have grown to €23 billion in 2022) and comprising:

- ICT Software & Solutions, are expected to have grown at a CAGR of 3.5% between 2019 and 2022,
which includes system software (e.g., operating system software such as Windows, Linux, and
Mainframe OS), middleware infrastructure software (e.g., software for network management,
storage management, and system management), and application software (e.g., horizontal software
such as Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”), CRM, business intelligence and analytics, unified
communications, and vertical software focused on addressing value chains within a certain industry,
such as healthcare, finance, and banking); and

- ICT Services, are expected to have grown at CAGR of 6.1% between 2019 and 2022, which
includes services for software application development and maintenance, system integration,
technology consulting, training and technical support, cloud computing services (including
Software-as-a-Service), and ICT infrastructure management services.

The six months ended December 31, 2022, were affected by a general deterioration in the Italian
economy, in particular by a decline in household consumption and a slowdown in GDP growth. All in
all, almost all sectors are expected to have grown in 2022, albeit less anticipated in June. The negative
trend for Network Services, already observed in previous years, is predicted to continue.

**Development of the Italian ICT market from 2019 to 2022:**

**__________________________**

Source: Anitec-Assinform November 2022

**Growth trends 2021 compared to 2020**

Devices and systems recorded the highest growth, namely a 9.1% increase reaching from €19.4 billion
in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €21.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly
driven by higher sales of personal computers and TV sets. ICT Software and solutions grew by 8%,
from €7.5 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €8.1 billion in the year ended
December 31, 2021. ICT Services grew by 7.6%, from €12.7 billion in the year ended
December 31, 2020, to €13.7 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021, following the resumption of
investments in system integration services and the significant growth in cloud computing and
cybersecurity services. Investments in digital content and advertising also increased, mainly driven by
increased advertising spend on internet platforms.

Overall, the following initiatives and drivers were key elements for accelerating digital investments:


-----

- Companies seeking to create new business models and revenue streams to compensate for revenue
losses caused mainly by the COVID-19 pandemic;

- ICT infrastructure readiness to support new business models (e.g., hybrid working);

- Increased digital interactions with partners and customers and the urge to digitize processes; and

- Robust cybersecurity tools to protect data and applications are required alongside accelerating
digitalization

**Expected trends from 2022 to 2025 show continued growth of the Italian digital market**

Forecasts of the digital market until 2025 are conditioned to be affected not only by particularly
pessimistic macroeconomic situation, but also by the size of projects funded by the PNRR for digital
transformation of public administration and the production system, the impact of which is not yet
possible to be fully determined. Against this background, however, the Italian digital market is expected
to grow slightly in the year ending December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022,
from €79.1 billion by 3%, or approximately €2.3 billion, to €81.4 billion.

With the launch of new applications, infrastructure and digital transformation projects, in many cases
linked to the resources made available by the PNRR, the market-share of ICT Software & Solutions
and ICT Services is expected to increase. In the year ending December 31, 2023, the first segment is
expected to experience a positive trend, mainly in the Middleware and IT Security segments. ICT
Services will continue to benefit primarily from an increase in applications digitization and
replatforming projects, as well as from a transformation aimed at supporting the cloud migration.

The cloud is expected to continue growing by 25%, given its central role in the digital transformation
of companies and its stated role in the digital transition of the Italian public administration sector.
Overall, ICT Services are expected to reach a significant value of €20 billion by 2025. Investment in
Digital Advertising will also increase in the wider market segment of Digital Content and Advertising,
which is expected to reach €15.4 billion in 2023 (representing a 6.1% growth compared to 2022).

**The importance of the PNRR**

Italy’s commitment to its digital transformation is concrete and critically supported by the PNRR. The
total PNRR resources will be allocated towards six distinct missions: Mission 1 on digitization,


-----

innovation, competitiveness, culture, and tourism; Mission 2 on green revolution and ecological
transition; Mission 3 on infrastructure for sustainable mobility; Mission 4 on education and research;
Mission 5 on inclusion and cohesion; and Mission 6 on healthcare. Digitization represents the first of
the six missions, which accounts for approximately 27% of the total PNRR funding.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Italy has been progressing with its PNRR objectives,
meeting all 51 milestones and targets set for 2021 and all 83 milestones and 17 targets set for 2022.
Overall, Italy has received €42 billion in payments in grants and loans based on milestones and targets
achieved in the first and second tranches. The country expects to be disbursed another €19 billion in
grants and loans for the third tranche, covering various reforms (e.g., areas of primary and secondary
education system, tax courts and administration, annual competition laws) and investments (e.g., digital
infrastructure, cybersecurity and smart grids _(Source: European Parliamentary Research Service,_

addressable initiatives under “Mission 1” and “Mission 6” by the Group.

We believe the Group’s digital solutions fit within the PNRR’s cornerstone package, transition 4.0,
focusing on digital investments and R&D. The Group’s products and services can serve multiple
objectives around digitization, innovation, and competitiveness. By providing cutting-edge
technologies, such as cloud, cybersecurity, and AI, the Group can help businesses and the public
administration realize a wide range of PNRR projects. For instance, among the various PNRR
objectives, digital citizenship spans across multiple missions, such as smart government in Mission 1,
and e-health in Mission 6. The Group is naturally positioned to support businesses and government
investments as it can provide specific tools and capabilities for each of the components of the objectives
according to the relevant missions.


-----

**Objectives of Mission 1 and relevant PNRR resources (€ million)**

Source: Anitec-Assinform November 2022

Italy’s ambition to aggressively pursue digitalization is evidenced by the government’s planned reforms
to facilitate the PNRR investments. A total of 63 reforms, both structural and regulatory, aspire to
remove procedural obstacles and simplify the bureaucracy to ensure greater flexibility in the execution
of the plan. Among others, those reforms concern competition, health, labor and tax.

**Digital Market Forecast Scenarios and PNRR Impact**

The development of the digital market in Italy until 2025 will increasingly be affected by ICT
investments financed through and supported by the PNRR. Areas such as public administration will see
clear benefits as 27% of the PNRR budget is earmarked for its digitization. Similarly, digital health
market is being driven by investments under objective 6 of the PNRR. However, not all ICT investments


-----

implemented through the availability of PNRR resources should be considered as incremental to the
ICT market, as some of these initiatives are already planned and PNRR may be used to help finance
their implementation.

**The macro-economic environment and the correlation with the ICT industry**

After the COVID-19 driven decline in 2020, Italy experienced a significant economic recovery in 2021.
In 2021, Italy implemented the PNRR, which boosted the country’s commitment to accomplish its
digital transformation, which represents the first of the missions identified by the PNRR. From a
regulatory and political point of view at EU and national level, the response to the COVID-19
challenges, such as the Recovery Plan for Europe and the PNRR in Italy, places ICT technologies at the
heart of an ambitious ten-year vision for successful digital transformation by 2030. The next generation
EU instrument aims to make the economy more sustainable, resilient and better prepared for the future.
The technologies for digital transformation are critical to achieving this. Digitization is fundamental to
the growth, economic development, and development of companies across all economic sectors. In the
year ended December 31, 2021, the Italian GDP rebounded, growing by 6.6% compared to the previous
year, driven by both consumption and investments. While IT spending as a percentage of the Italian
GDP has been historically lower than other European countries, the digital market witnessed a healthy
growth of 5.3% in the year ended December 31, 2021, contributing 4.2% to the Italian GDP. The digital
market was expected to have grown by 2.1% in the year ended December 31, 2022, contributing
approximately 4.0% to the Italian GDP

**Indicators and benefits of the business digitalization**

A 2022 investment survey carried out by the European Investment Bank indicates greater optimism on
the investment prospects of Italian companies. In the current survey, more Italian firms (85%) were
investing than they were compared to the previous survey (80%). Similarly, despite repeated economic
shocks in 2021-2022 (e.g., COVID-19 and the Ukrainian conflict), Italian firms’ pace of innovation has
not been impacted. In 2022, almost half (47%) of Italy’s firms developed or introduced new products,
processes or services as part of their investment activities, similar to the results of 2021’s investment
survey (46%) and higher than the EU average (34%). However, the number of companies expecting


-----

investments to increase, rather than decline, stood at approximately 16%, a decline from 24% in the
prior year’s survey and close to the EU average (net balance of 20%). The share of investments for the
year ended December 31, 2022, in machinery and equipment is significant (representing approximately
51% of the total investments). In addition, investments in intangible assets (R&D, software, Data, IT
activities, websites and training and business processes) remained relatively stable at 38% of total
investments compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.

**Breakdown of investments made by Italian companies between 2019 and 2022**

**___________________________**
Source: Anitec Assinform 2022, European Investment Bank Investment Survey, 2022 and 2021

Companies in the services sector, are increasing their investments in software, IT, and data with the
latter being essential for analyzing and segmenting customers. Investments in digital technologies
regarding processes and data are also made by manufacturing companies and large businesses, which
also continue to have the highest share of investments in R&D. To this end, the PNRR is expected to
critically support the digitization of manufacturing plants. Analysis carried out by the European
Investment Bank in its 2022 investment survey, shows that, approximately 55% of Italian firms have
taken action in response to COVID-19; the survey notes that the most frequent response, especially
among large firms, has been to become more digital (41% vs. 53% EU). Moreover, approximately 68%
of the Italian companies are using at least one advanced digital technology, in line with EU average.
Companies are also demonstrating an increased awareness of security risks due to the exponential
growth of cyber threats, which have driven both large and small companies to adopt adequate defense
capabilities.

E-commerce also experienced strong tailwinds due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is now central
in the new buying habits of consumers. In the year ended December 31, 2021, online purchases in Italy
reached a total of €39.4 billion, which represents a 21% increase compared to total online purchases in
the year ended December 31, 2020. Consequently, businesses at large have moved to launching online
sales channels, which resulted in a 17.5% increase in the share of business sales from online sales
between the year ended December 31, 2019, and 2021.

**Digital Enablers, digital transformers, and the traditional market**

An analysis on the expected trends in the market highlights the persisting bifurcation between the
growth of the more innovative digital enablers, which is expected to range between 13% and 14%
between 2020 and 2025, and the overall digital market. The trend is stemming from an impressive
tendency towards cloud, cybersecurity and data management and analysis, which is expected to further
reduce the growth gap between the traditional ICT sector and the digital market, underpinned by digital
transformation of the more traditional components of the market such as network, systems, and
applications.

While in the year ended December 31, 2020 growth was mainly driven by activities to respond to
COVID-19 and enable business continuity via remote activities, in the year ended December 31, 2021
showed a continuous trend of increased awareness of the need of digital for companies, which
understood that the transition to the cloud is essential to reach the scalability and reactivity levels that
the market requires to remain competitive. Such awareness has translated into cloud migration plans
across businesses in various sectors.

At the same time, with the implementation of a strategy for a national cloud and approximately €1
billion budgeted by the PNRR, cloud has become an enabling platform for digitization of public
administration. Private and Virtual Private Cloud are models that affect more traditional organizations
or companies that need to maintain data and applications within proprietary datacenters or in dedicated
areas at cloud datacenters. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the growth of these models has been
moderate, at a rate of 11% and 14.7%, respectively compared to the previous year. The Infrastructureas-a-Service (“IaaS”) cloud represents the largest share of the total cloud market with a 52.7% share,
followed by the Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) which holds a 41% share. Platform-as-a-Service
(“PaaS”), which requires a high level of customization and is mainly used for data applications analytics
and AI, is still limited relative to the others.

**Big Data**

Data is a strategic asset for all businesses. The value of the big data industry exceeded €1.3 billion in
the year ended December 31, 2021, a 15.4% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Double-digit growth in spending on solutions and services for optimal data management is a result of
greater awareness of Italian companies that need to be able to guarantee adequate governance. The
methods and systems used to extract knowledge from structured data, plays a key role in improving
competitiveness, resilience, and decision-making processes.

**Cybersecurity**

The cybersecurity market is estimated to have experienced a double-digit growth of 13% in the year
ended December 31, 2022 and was valued approximately €1.6 billion. 2022 saw an increase in cyberattacks with the highest number of attacks ever seen at 225 in March 2022 alone. “Hacktivism” saw a
4x increase, followed by the ‘Information Warfare’ category, growing at 119%. Espionage (+62%
compared to the first half of 2021) was another reason for growth in number of cyber-attacks.

**Evolution of the cybersecurity market from 2019 to 2022 (expected)**

Source: Anitec-Assinform 2022

All segments are expected to have grown in the year ended December 31, 2022, with managed security
services (“MSS”) expected to have experienced the highest growth rate, of 15.4% in the year ended
December 31, 2022, and an annual average growth rate of 16.7%. However, demand for MSS is
reducing because of a need to address the shortage of resources and the use of external security and
operations control center 24x7 services.


-----

The second segment, in order of market relevance, is System Integration and other services, expected
to have grown by 12.1% in 2022, reaching almost €600 million. There is an increased adoption of
identity and access governance solutions, required to be strengthened to manage the transition to the
hybrid working model in a secure manner. In the area of software solution implementation
infrastructure, the Endpoint Detection & Response and the SIEM solutions are also expected to grow
to monitor the extended perimeter, which is more and more beyond that of the individual company.

Consultancy services (Advice), although expected to have a low overall market share at €86 million in
2022, are expected to have grown at a high rate (annual average growth rate increasing by 13.1%) with
the most popular category being Risk and Vulnerability Assessment.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Cognitive**

In the year ended December 31, 2021, spending rebounded and the market resumed its growth trajectory
at a rapid pace, reaching approximately €330 million, which represented a 31.5% increase compared to
the year ended December 31, 2020. The main driver for such increase was the realization that AI
technologies can deliver competitive advantages by supporting strategic decision-making and
improving operational efficiencies (i.e., failure and downtime prevention, streamlining repetitive tasks,
improving security, and compliance). Currently, there is a significant divide in AI investments between
large companies and Small Medium Enterprises (“SMEs”), but the adoption of AI from SMEs is
expected to increase, mainly driven by the development of the Italian Strategy for Artificial Intelligence,
which outlines the policies to be implemented in next three years aiming to enhance the artificial
intelligence system in Italy.

**The Internet of Things (IoT)**

The IoT market in Italy resumed its growth in the year ended December 31, 2021 after the setback in
the year ended December 31, 2020, reaching a market value of over €3.7 billion, representing a 9.9%
increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Growth was driven by the resumption of
projects that were postponed in 2020 mainly due to the COVID-19-related restrictions. Furthermore,
growth was also fueled by services trials of remote assistance and monitoring of COVID-19 patients in
the healthcare space, catalyzing the development of telemedicine services. The evolution of IoT related
projects is also expected to benefit from PNRR resources that range across several initiatives such as
smart factories, telemedicine, smart cities and smart grids.

**Digital transformation trends in the main economic sectors**

Public administration and Health are two sectors where spending on digital technology is expected to
be more intensive, above the overall average. This trend reflects the PNRR’s planning for digitization
and innovation of public entities and companies in the healthcare sector, whereas the banks, industrials,
defense, and insurance sectors are broadly in line with the average spend. In the financial sector, banking
groups are emphasizing new business models based on open finance, while insurance companies are
investing to outweigh delays in digitization which has traditionally characterized the industry. The
industrial sector, despite the difficult economic context, is likely to benefit from the launch of direct
investments targeted at optimizing core processes to increase competitiveness.

In the year ended December 31, 2021, all sectors showed positive trends, driven by the resumption of
investments and the growing need of companies to adapt to new and emerging operating models. During
the year ended December 31, 2020, most of the companies were forced to take measures to ensure
business continuity, which led to greater awareness of the strategic nature of digital technologies, not
only to support a company’s success, but also to sustain Italy’s competitiveness. Consequently,
spending and investments increased across all sectors in the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly in
respect of public administration and health. Cloud technologies, automation of processes and services,
cybersecurity, data governance and the modernization of architectures and data management platforms
represent the main investment drivers across all areas.

**Banks**

The banking sector grew by 8.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to an expectation of
5.6% in the year ended December 31, 2022. This growth was driven by the restart of modernization
plans that involve digitalization and updating of the information systems as well as new initiatives to
support the transition towards innovative operating and business models, where digital technologies
play both an enabling and strategic role. Customer behavior has evolved, shifting to digital channels as
opposed to physical branches for transactional operations and other activities. Such behavior
accelerated downsizing of bank branches — which totaled approximately 23.5 thousand by the year
ended on December 31, 2020, with further closures expected to have occurred throughout 2022 — and
has induced even the most traditional banks to direct their customer services onto digital platforms. This
transition has been resulting in fintech services having been integrated within the banks’ business
models, with most of them partnering with fintech businesses and in large part investing in such fintech
companies.

In the near future, digitization is expected to become one of the strongest drivers in the evolution of the
operating models and services of financial institutions, as evidenced by the trend and plans of leading
banking groups. In this regard, architectural evolution, cloud, and application renewal are indispensable


-----

ingredients for digital transformation, to ensure flexibility and optimal user experience across all
channels. Many banks are overcoming resistance to cloud adoption, which was mainly coming from the
need to keep their data within the European territory, as a result the choice of some of the main
Hyperscalers to create their own infrastructure in Italy. The transition to the cloud, with the adoption of
a hybrid multicloud model has been undertaken mainly by large banks and involves complex project
management considering the legacy architecture that characterizes traditional banking operations. Such
projects are expected to start with the modernization of applications through containerization, and then
progressively result in a shift of most applications onto the cloud.

In addition, cybersecurity represents a further high priority investment, which has always captured a
significant portion of banks’ IT budgets. The primary area of investment is expected to focus on
strengthening endpoint security and access from a ZeroTrust perspective, together with secure by design
approach, which means that software products and capabilities have been designed to be foundationally
secure. Data governance and, in general, the evolution of data architecture will also be high priority
areas of investment and will be instrumental to reengineering certain processes (e.g., providing credit
to a customer) and to the personalization of customer services and relationships.

**High priority investment areas in the banking sector in 2021 and 2022**

**___________________________**
Source: Anitec-Assinform 2022

For banks, the expectation has been for a growth demand of 5.6% for the year ended
December 31, 2022, entailing the market reaching a total size of €9.1 billion. Demand has been further
expected to growth by 7% in the year ended December 31, 2023. The industry has continued to invest
in digital as a lever for transforming business and labor-market models. Italian banks, having
demonstrated strong resilience in the pandemic period, by focusing on digital to ensure continuity of
service to their customers, gained a greater awareness in the year ended December 31, 2022 of the
potential of digital technology to support their strategies and the need to renew their architectures to
innovate organizational models and to compete in a market environment of increasing challenges. The
transition to the Cloud and the evolution of data architectures and Analytics are part of the strategic
plans of the main Italian banks. Transforming customer relationships into a hybrid model also requires
a continuous strengthening of cybersecurity to ensure secure access to banking services while providing
the best customer experience. Business modernization remains one of the main areas of investment.

**Insurance**

Digital demand in the insurance and finance sectors is forecast to grow by +4.7% (€2.4 billion) in the
year ended December 31, 2022 and 5.3% in the year ended December 31, 2023 (€2.6 billion),
respectively. A key area of investment is digitization of customer relationships, at all stages of


-----

contractual relationship. Robotic process automation is an additional priority investment area which
aims at achieving greater operational efficiency, with projects focused on back-office process
automation, such as claims management, after-sales and administration, and finance. Investment in
cybersecurity, like in banking, is also seeing a rise in insurance.

**Industry & Services**

Industrial companies have been experiencing a period of high uncertainty, mainly due to the persistence
of the COVID-19 pandemic and, more recently, the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, which has led to a sharp
rise in agricultural, metals, and energy prices.

Between the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, approximately 70% of the total
investments were dedicated to the acquisition of functional machinery for digitization, compared to
approximately 30% for traditional machinery. As a result, digital spending in the industrial sector
amounted to €8.5 billion, a 7.9% increase compared to 2020. The digital investments in the sector are
also expected to be supported by PNRR resources in connection with the so-called transition 4.0. In
particular, industrial companies are expected to benefit in terms of R&D, innovation, and functional
training programs, aiming to provide the necessary digital skills and know-how to enable industry 4.0,
with the main areas of investment expected to be in cybersecurity, as cyber-attacks on companies are
progressively increasing.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, digital spending has been sustained by operators in the
distribution and services sector, which has recorded a substantial recovery over the previous year, up to
over €4.6 billion, a 7% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The last two years
ended December 31, 2022 saw a profound digital transformation in the sector, which became essential
to ensure the operational continuity of the distribution of necessities and to cope with intermittent
closures imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. E-commerce and fast delivery have proved to be
indispensable levers to compete on the market. While in the year ended December 31, 2020 retailers
had to find workarounds against lockdowns, in 2021 such issues were addressed in a more structured
way, becoming essential priorities guiding the digital transformation plans for the sector. In terms of
2021 priorities, digitization projects around solutions for the digital customer is seen as the main
investment area, coupled with the optimization of e-commerce processes and innovation of marketing
and loyalty campaigns.


-----

**Telco & Media**

Telco and Media market size was €9.3 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021, a 6.3% increase
compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Overall, the market has benefitted from smart working
solutions deployed by a number of companies and entities of the public administration. Such policies
have allowed a substantial increase of broadband connections to adequately meet the needs of remote
workers. The market is showing signs of resilience and growth, evidencing its critical role in the overall
Italian economy. Between 2010 and 2021, the share of the population with access to the Internet
increased from approximately 52% to approximately 82%. To support the demand for connectivity,
operators had to invest significantly in growing the network and related services. In the last decade, the
overall investments of the sector amounted to approximately €65 billion, allowing the country to largely
bridge the gap with the rest of Europe in terms of population reached by bandwidth services. The main
digital projects conducted in the Telco & Media sector include big data and data management,
cybersecurity and a whole set of application modernization solutions that also involve cloud SaaS
projects. The sector is particularly involved in digital infrastructure projects envisaged by the PNRR,
such as “Connected School”, “Connected Health” and “Italy 5G”, with a total estimated investment
need of approximately €9.1 billion.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the telecommunications and media sector has reached an
overall digital spending of €9.5 billion, a growth of 1.5% compared to the year ended
December 31, 2021, which has slowed sharply compared to previous years. The spending is being
distributed on several fronts but is now clustered by two prevailing strands. On the one hand, the need
to extend the communication infrastructure across Italy, with the need to maintain a high flow of
investment. On the other hand, the need to speed up the process of modernizing technology envelopes,
which has been repeatedly postponed and which is even more necessary at this particular historical
moment, where maintaining old systems can be a resource-intensive process. With regards to the
specific technology areas covered by the most relevant projects, the ten-digit increase in the use of cloud
architectures, particularly in the presence of technological refreshes, is confirmed, in addition to the
increase in the use of intelligent business solutions to better intercept the needs of customers (Media)
and to prevent the intention of changing the provider (Telco).

**Energy and Utilities**

Digital spending in the utility sector is also estimated to be growing in the year ended
December 31, 2022, albeit slowing down compared to performance in the year ended
December 31, 2021. The market has been expected to reach a size of €2.1 billion in the year ended
December 31, 2022, compared to a size of €2.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 and
representing a 3.7% increase. The increase in energy prices and the increased risks from NPL (for
coverage and credit), price cap and untying of gas prices and the search for alternative sources of energy
are expected to have had an impact on the slowdown. In addition, supply routes for full energy transition
and electrification, as promoted by the UN Sustainable Development Goal and the European Green
Deal, are limited. During the year ended December 31, 2022, and in particular in the six months ended
December 31, 2022, the focus of business in this sector was on modernizing processes and improving
efficiencies, but also on customer care. The projects re-look at the implementation modernization,
including the deployment of micro-service platforms, as well as the more intensive and comprehensive
use of the Cloud, in infrastructure and application (including and especially in CRM) to make the
enterprise flexible and flexible in its ability to respond to changing circumstances. Together, there is a
strong focus on investment in digitization of networks, on smart meters, for the collection of supplies
to energy production plants, for predictive maintenance of networks and facilities and asset
management. In several cases, we are starting to see the flourishing of Digital Twin solutions for
modeling the operation of gas and energy plants and networks. Increasing consideration is given to
investments in BI/Analytics for the re-establishment of a data management architecture that ensures
data quality at all business levels and enables scenario formulation. Investments in Cybersecurity,
including attacks during the day-to-day, are crucial and continuous, in order to build a security by design


-----

at all levels, including the components of Network and IOT. With projects targeting identity
governance, strengthening disaster recovery and business continuity solutions.

**Public Administration**

In the year ended December 31, 2021, the public administration made progresses in digitization
projects, with spending by the central public administration increasing by 9.4%, and local public
administration spend reaching €1.4 billion, representing a 9% growth compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020. Most of the projects focused on the implementation of the objectives of the threeyear plan for IT of the public administration and, in particular, on the evolution of citizen services with
a view to digital and mobile first and on the adoption of main digital enabling platforms. The PNRR
has emphasized the role of digitization of the public administration to ensure competitiveness of the
Italian economy. Mission 1 under the PNRR foresees a €6.1 billion total spend on the digitization of
procedures and processes, the strengthening of cybersecurity and the implementation of the national
cloud strategy. Investments financed through the PNRR are expected to support the digital market for
the public administration in the coming years, with most of the projects starting in the year ended
December 31, 2023. Cybersecurity constitutes a further cornerstone of Mission 1 under the PNRR, with
investments expected to amount to approximately €623 million, of which €194 million in the year ended
December 31, 2022, including the costs related to the establishment of the National Cybersecurity
Agency and the introduction of new personnel in the areas of public security and judicial police for the
prevention and investigation of cybercrime.

**Healthcare**

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the healthcare sector transitioned from a phase of
experimentation to one of designing structured digital projects, which supported the sector’s continued
growth path. The health sector saw an increase of 8.8% in the digital market, from €1.9 billion in the
year ended December 31, 2021 to €2.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2022, a slightly shrinking
trend compared to the two-year period before the cedar era, which experienced a 9.6% growth. In
addition, the market is expected to grow further in the year ending December 31, 2023 (for a growth of
10.5%, or €2,250 million). To overcome secular inefficiencies, the PNRR dedicates an entire mission
to Italy’s health system, allocating more than €20 billion to investments targeting the development of
local health and the digital evolution of the sector. The development of the digital health market is
driven by investments under objective 6 of the PNRR.

In particular, the main digital challenges set forth by the national plan in the health area concern the
evolution of the Electronic Health Record (“ESF”), with the objective of:

- making such record system an ecosystem of data and services supporting citizens, health workers,
public bodies, and researchers;

- setting up a telemedicine network, spreading from the national platform into all territories and
forming the basis of new community medicine; and

- modernizing the medical equipment.

An analysis on a significant sample of health companies, public and private hospitals, and regions,
showed that the primary area of focus for intervention should be telemedicine. Moreover, the
enhancement of the Electronic Medical Record represents a further area of investment activity,
emphasizing the need to implement digital solutions at the hospital level.

**The Italian ICT Services market**

The Italian ICT Services market can be divided into four major service segments:

- Application Development and System Integration, which consists of designing or modernizing
applications through new digital technologies and development methods;

- Managed IT, which includes, among others, the management of existing applications and data
center services;

- Cloud Computing, which relates to both public and hybrid cloud computing services, including
IaaS, PaaS and SaaS; and


-----

- Other services, which consists of helpdesk services and other technical support functions.

Among these segments, the Group operates in Application Development, Cloud Computing and
Managed IT services.

There are two main growth drivers in the Italian ICT services market, namely an increasing penetration
of IT services in Italy, and an ongoing process of digitalization, characterized by a digital transformation
of traditional IT to new digital enabling technologies, an increased interaction among partners and
customers while implementing the digitalization of the processes, and the ICT infrastructure readiness
to support new business models. Digital transformation is driving the growth in every sector,
determining cost savings and automation. The ICT Services market amounted to approximately €13.7
billion in the year ended December 31, 2021, a 7.6% increase compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020. Within this market, cloud experienced the highest growth and increased by 24.4%
compared to the previous year up to €4.2 billion. Demand for cloud services is growing, across various
economic areas and supported by both large companies and SMEs, which are gradually turning to it.

**Growth in the Italian ICT services market from 2020 to 2021**

Source: Anitec-Assinform 2022

Data center-related services decreased by 2.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the
previous year, mainly as a result of increased focus on cloud-related services, with Cloud Computing
Services overcoming the ICT Outsourcing services market. This decreasing trend of the ICT
Outsourcing services market is further driven by the increase in Software maintenance service, which
grew by 4.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, and services management of
telecommunications components, whereas the markets for processing services and IT outsourcing
services decreased by 3.8% and 0.2% over the same period, respectively.

Development and system integration services showed a sustained recovery with an increase of 3.8% in
the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the previous year, up to €3.1 billion. The restart of
projects in many sectors and the strong trend towards digitization, emerges from the progress of the
infrastructural projects and application projects which increased by 3.5% and 5.3%, respectively, over
the same period. Custom software also registered a 5.1% growth in the year ended December 31, 2021
compared to the previous year. The reaction to the emergency stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic
supported a continued focus on activities towards business continuity, with a slowdown or, in many
cases, the interruption of projects related to the evolution and modernization of vertical applications.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the market rebounded with investments in cybersecurity,
big data architectures and, accordingly, in advanced analytics. Large companies have also initiated
projects to implement robotic process automation.


-----

Consulting services grew by 5.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the previous year,
mainly due to digital and cloud transformation projects. Application investments, on the other hand,
confirm an ever-increasing need for solutions for digital customers and, more generally, for application
modernization projects dedicated to the functional and operational integration of the existing systems
with cloud environments, which are now available to almost all the large information systems.

**The Italian ICT Software and Solutions market**

The Italian Software and Solutions market is composed of the following segments:

- Application Software, which can be further segmented into vertical focused industry solutions,
horizontal software solutions, including ERP and CRM software, and various digital application
software, including cloud, web, IoT;

- Infrastructure Software (or middleware), which includes IT management and governance tools,
infrastructure management, storage, security and information management, development and
integration platforms; and

- System Software, which includes operating system and network operating system software.

The Group focuses on the Application Software segment, with a suite of vertical focused industry
solutions and horizontal software solutions dedicated to the Italian corporate market.

At the end of 2021, the Italian Software and Solutions market rebounded to pre-pandemic levels,
growing by 8% compared to 2020, mainly due to a noteworthy increase of expenditure in Application
Software, which is in turn driven by direct investments in smart business / IoT platforms. In particular,
such projects mainly focus on the industrial sectors, such as retail, utilities and transportation, where
optimization of production management, transportation, warehousing, and other facilities is of utmost
importance.

**The Italian Software and Solutions market from 2019 to 2021**

Investments in web management platforms reflect the increasing importance of an effective online
presence, supporting e-commerce and broader solutions for commercial processes as well as emerging
business models based on multi-channels.

Horizontal and vertical solutions also grew in the year ended December 31, 2021, even if at a slower
pace, in line with the strong setbacks experienced in the year ended December 31, 2020. In the year


-----

ended December 31, 2021, the recovery in investments concerned business intelligence and analytics
solutions and technical applications, to support management of the operations in many sectors and of
vertical applications, which aim to help a company’s core business processes. The horizontal solutions,
mainly consisting of individual productivity suites, ERP, and main solutions of extended-ERP, are
expected to continue to suffer from growing maturity and progressive migration to the cloud, also due
to the persistent smart working environment that mandates more technologically advanced solutions.
The development of the middleware software is supported by the need of companies to protect and
better organize their information assets and to manage the growing heterogeneity and hybridization of
infrastructures. Lastly, system software started growing again especially in the operating systems. PC
and laptop’s operating systems continue to struggle, although mildly compared to 2020 when companies
had focused on the purchase of new devices and systems rather than updating their operating platforms.

**Leading positioning in a highly competitive market**

The Italian market is fragmented with large local Italian players such as Engineering and Reply, and
Italian businesses of global players such as Accenture and IBM, enjoying strong market positions across
verticals, followed by a long tail of smaller local providers. Across sectors where it operates, such as
financial institutions, energy, and industry, Engineering has been supporting firms with their core
processes establishing deep relationships with its clients by providing end-to-end services, from strategy
creation to implementation, positioning itself as a one-stop-shop for clients’ key digital needs. As the
next phase of digital transformation is moving from non-core to core process, the Group is well
positioned to support firms with their core transformation initiatives which will be critical for their
future success.

Additionally, given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, employing and retaining individuals
has become challenging. In the face of such challenges, the Group has benefitted from its initiative of
upskilling and re-skilling its employees. Students from universities and schools are recruited directly
from campus and upskilled through various training programs. Such a move has assisted Engineering
in being able to employ over 1,500 people throughout 2022, in a market where there has been a
widespread shortage of talented resources.

The Italian ICT Services market presents some unique characteristics that differentiate it from other
European analogous markets, and constitute significant barriers to entry for potential competitors,
particularly those operating in other European markets, including:

- Italian identity (including the knowledge of the Italian language, which represents an important
advantage of domestic players vis-à-vis foreign competitors);

- In-depth knowledge of local market dynamics and regulatory environment;

- Strong historical relationships with customers, coupled with the complexities and high costs
normally associated with switching IT service provider; and

##  Proximity to customers, which allows IT service providers to be responsive to customers’ needs.

The combination of these characteristics makes it difficult for foreign competitors, including large
Indian IT outsourcing companies, to enter the Italian ICT Services market, and represents a significant
competitive advantage for local players as demonstrated by the relatively high proportion of revenues
they generate.

According to information derived from a global consulting company industry report, the perspectives
for the ICT market in the financial services sector follow three trends, namely platforms and ecosystems,
the legacy replacement and the enhancement of multichannels. With regards platforms and ecosystems,
technology is becoming a platform game, where “buy” wins over “make”. The trends show that custom
solutions will be replaced by standard software and the cloud adoption will increase mainly driven by
PaaS use, while system integrators will remain essential to transition in such platforms. The second
trend concerns the transition to a “digital” legacy. Cloud, in all its forms, and the services related thereto
are substituting the standard way to do software and infrastructure as Saas, PaaS and Iaas are becoming
normality. Moreover, digital platforms are in turn the legacy of customized solutions and hyperscalers
and large players are betting to build an “as a service” capacity in Italy. Lastly, Italian banks need to
enhance their multichannel to close the user experience and functional gaps compared to the other
European Union competitors. Among the various initiatives, banks are expected to review their
customer journey and mobile core system, make services instant, implement technology in order to fully
intermediate easy to complex interactions, and modern front-ends paramount.

**Overview**

We are a leading specialist provider of IT services, software and digital solutions in Italy, with a market
share of approximately 13% in Application & Infrastructure Implementation and 8% in Application
Managed Services, ranking first in three of the five industry verticals under Implementation services in
which we operate, in each case calculated in terms revenue (constant currency basis), in 2022, according
to Gartner® research (Gartner Inc., Market Share: IT Services Worldwide 2022, April 2023). We
provide a holistic suite of leading software and digital solutions to more than 2,750 customers, including
companies and public administration entities, and focus on supporting our customers in digital
transformation projects through a portfolio of integrated ICT solutions, products and consultancy
services. We couple new and advanced digital enabling capabilities, including artificial intelligence AI
and advanced analytics, cloud-based services, cybersecurity, customer experience, IoT, robotic process
automation, AR / MR / VR, blockchain and digital twin platforms, with a strong know-how of
traditional technological solutions and an intimate knowledge of our broad client base’s core processes.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenues of €1,422.6 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of €207.8 million (representing an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 14.6%). In addition,
following settlement of the Mandatory Offer on December 22, 2022 and completion of the SqueezeOut on December 28, 2022, we successfully completed the Be Acquisition, and as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, we wholly own the Be Group. The Be Group is one of the leading Italian
players in the IT consulting sector and provider of business consulting, information technology and
digital business services to major financial and insurance institutions in Europe, including Italy. The Be
Group also showcases distinctive capabilities in specialized areas such as services for corporate
investment banking and capital markets (including process design solutions, back-office systems, and
capital markets accounting and brokerage platforms), as well as the payments sector (including card
based products, value-added services and open banking models, as well as services for payment systems
and schemes). After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other


-----

companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had
occurred on January 1, 2022, we estimate that the aggregated revenues of the Group for the year ended
December 31, 2022 would have been €1,636.8 million. In addition, after adjusting our Adjusted
EBITDA to include the Adjusted EBITDA of the Be Group and the Adjusted EBITDA of certain
companies acquired in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for
the year ended December 31, 2022), the expected run rate impact from certain ongoing cost saving
activities that we started implementing in 2022, and the impact of certain cost savings synergies
expected to be generated from the integration of the Be Group into our business, in each case, as if such
acquisitions were completed, and such initiatives, actions and cost savings synergies were fully
implemented, as of January 1, 2022, we estimate that our Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA for
the year ended December 31, 2022 would have been €256.9 million.

We operate in the attractive and growing Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets which
proved resilient against the COVID-19 pandemic and, according to Anitec-Assinform, grew at a CAGR
of approximately 4.4% between 2019 and 2021. In 2021, these markets were worth approximately €21.8
billion. The Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets benefit from strong ongoing
digitalization across the Italian public and private sectors and increasing spending in transformation
projects from traditional IT to new digital enabling technologies, which further increased underpinned
by the PNRR adopted by the Italian government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our leading
position in the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets, which has been further
consolidated following the successful completion of the Be Acquisition, coupled with our deep local
and regional market knowledge and long-lasting relationships with our customers and partners,
uniquely positions us to capitalize on the strong growth in demand for IT transformation services in
Italy, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% between 2021 and 2025, according to AnitecAssinform.

We offer our IT services, software and digital platforms and solutions to our customers by engaging in
four distinct activity types: Proprietary Solutions, Digitech, System Integration and Consulting:

- **Proprietary Solutions: We offer a wide range of cutting-edge customized, end-to-end IT**
services such as industry-specific, innovative vertical software and related services, primarily
to customers in our Finance, Energy & Utilities, Public Administration, Telco & Media and
Health industry verticals. Our Proprietary Solutions relate to four main software suites, and a
longer tail of approximately 20 smaller products, all developed in-house and owned by us. Our
Proprietary Solutions comprise end-to-end service partnerships with certain of our customers
through which we provide tailored digital service packages which also include System
Integration services. We estimate that, in 2021, we were one of the leading providers of
governance, risk and compliance reporting software for financial institutions, CRM solutions
and billing platforms for utilities providers and healthcare ERP solutions for hospitals in Italy
based on revenue. We generated 26.6% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022
from our activities related to Proprietary Solutions. Following the Be Acquisition, we have
integrated a portion of Be Group’s products and solutions into our Proprietary Solutions
portfolio (including, among others, Be Group’s proprietary digital platforms). After giving
effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies
completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had
occurred on January 1, 2022, we estimate for the year ended December 31, 2022 we would
have generated 24% of the aggregated revenues of the Group from activities related to
Proprietary Solutions.

- **Digitech: We develop and customize high-growth, state-of-the-art digital enabling solutions**
for third-party software, and, in particular, using advanced analytics, cloud, cybersecurity,
customer experience, IoT, robotic process automation, AR / MR / VR, digital twin and
blockchain technologies in cooperation with our partners, including, among others, Microsoft,
Google, Amazon, SAS, IBM and Oracle. In addition, we are also a leading service provider and
system integrator in Italy, customizing and developing third-party digital-enabled IT solutions


-----

through strategic partnerships with major software providers such as Salesforce and SAP. We
provide our Digitech activities on the basis of software and other technological products that
are non-proprietary, with the aim of offering highly customized solutions capable of being
integrated with both third-party and client-owned applications. In addition, as part of our
Digitech portfolio we support, maintain and update third party applications and offer projectbased system integration services for customers as well as software providers. Following the
acquisition of Atlantic Technologies, an international ICT consultancy firm with three offices
worldwide and more than 200 specialized and certified professionals, in 2022, we offer its
services as part of our Digitech portfolio. We generated 36.0% of our revenues in the year ended
December 31, 2022, from our activities related to Digitech. Following the successful
completion of the Be Acquisition, we have integrated a portion of Be Group’s solutions into
our Digitech portfolio (including, among others, certain of Be Group’s ICT solutions). After
giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies
completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had
occurred on January 1, 2022, we estimate for the year ended December 31, 2022 we would
have generated 33% of the aggregated revenues of the Group from activities related to Digitech.

- **System Integration: Our System Integration services comprise integration services related to**
the implementation, managing and maintenance of traditional IT solutions, as well as day-today management and operation services of our customer’ end-to-end infrastructure, including
hosting and desktop management. In addition, our System Integration portfolio comprises other
specialized services we offer to our customers, such as complex information systems,
customized system architectures and applications integration services (for new or existing
hardware and software). Our System Integration portfolio is also supported by our strong knowhow legacy. We generated 32.4% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022 from
our activities related to System Integration solutions. Following the successful completion of
the Be Acquisition, we have integrated a portion of Be Group’s solutions into our System
Integration portfolio (including, among others, the activities of Be’s subsidiary Be Digitech
Solutions S.p.A.). After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of
certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s
results) as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022, we estimate for the year ended December
31, 2022, we would have generated 28% of the aggregated revenues of the Group from activities
related to System Integration.

- **Consulting: Our Consulting activities comprise the business consulting, information**
technology and digital business services offered by the Be Group, mainly to major financial
and insurance institutions in Europe, including Italy. We generated 5.0% of our revenues in the
year ended December 31, 2022 from our activities related to Consulting, representing the
portion of Be’s revenues relating to business consulting, information technology and digital
business services for the period from its consolidation into our results (i.e., September 26, 2022)
until December 31, 2022. After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the
Group of certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the
Group’s results) as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022, we estimate for the year ended
December 31, 2022, we would have generated 14% of the aggregated revenues of the Group
from activities related to Consulting.

We operate in Italy as well as in 20 countries worldwide including major European countries (such as
Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), the United States and Latin
American countries, such as Brazil. For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues generated from
customers outside of Italy accounted for 18.3% of our total revenues. Moreover, following the
completion of the Be Acquisition, we strengthened our international operations, as we offer Be Group’s
products and services in three additional new countries (Poland, Romania and Albania), and increased
our presence in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the
acquisition by the Group of certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already
reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022, we estimate that


-----

approximately 21% of aggregated revenues of the Group would have been generated outside of Italy
for the year ended December 31, 2022. In Italy, we are present in all regions and most metropolitan
cities (including Milan, Rome and Turin) and operate across several sectors of the economy, including
public administration, financial services, utilities, telecommunications, transportation, infrastructure
and healthcare. In particular, we operate our activity types with industry-specific process knowledge
across six industry verticals, which correspond to our reporting segments under IFRS 8 (Operating
_Segments) and represent the verticals or strategic markets in which we operate, with industry-specific_
knowledge supported technologies and competences. Our six industry verticals are Finance, Health,
Industry & Services, Telco & Media, Energy & Utilities and Public Administration. In addition, for
internal reporting purposes, in 2022 we implemented a strategic initiative focusing on the consolidation
of our Energy & Utilities, Industry & Services and Telco & Media industry verticals into a new business
unit, “Enterprise,” and, in 2023, of our Health and Public Administration industry verticals into our new
“Public Sector” business unit. We believe that our new “Enterprise” business unit will increase our
ability to effectively respond to our customers’ needs, with the aim to deliver high-performing solutions
and strengthen our role in rapidly evolving markets. In particular, we believe that through “Enterprise”
we will increase the coordination between our industry verticals, while unlocking the ability to develop
high-quality digital systems for the delivery of cross-domain solutions.

The following charts show our revenues by activity type and industry vertical and geography for the
year ended December 31, 2022, giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of
certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results)
as if they had been completed on January 1, 2022:

______________

_(*) Aggregated figures for the year ended December 31, 2022, giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the_

_Group of certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they_
_had been completed on January 1, 2022._

Our customers include more than 2,750 entities, including large private and blue chip companies and
public sector bodies, among which are six of the largest Italian banks (including Intesa Sanpaolo,
UniCredit and Banco BPM), major telecommunications and media companies (including Vodafone and
TIM), utilities companies (including Enel and Eni), manufacturing companies (including Stellantis)),
healthcare organizations (including the Veneto Region healthcare system and many other large hospitals
in Italy), local public administrations (including the municipalities of Rome and Milan, as well as the
IT services arm of the Lombardy region and the Emilia Romagna and Campania regions) and
transportation and infrastructure companies (including _Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane). In 2022 we_
worked on approximately 36,600 individual IT services, software and digital solutions contracts, which
were distributed amongst our customers. We seek to create long-term, strategic relationships with our
customers, and aim to be viewed as an integral part of their businesses. We have historically been able
to achieve long-lasting, integral customer relationships by creating significantly customized and highly


-----

specialized products and services that we integrate into our end-customers’ IT systems. Our average
relationship tenure with customers is approximately ten years. Our business benefits from low customer
concentration and significant customer diversification across all of our industry verticals, with no
customer accounting for more than 6.0% of our revenues and no industry vertical accounting for more
than 26.4% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. In the same period, our top ten
customers generated 30% of our revenues.

We believe our success and leading position in the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions
markets is largely dependent on our strong focus on R&D, and we invested approximately €25 million
in R&D in the year ended December 31, 2022. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we are
involved in more than 100 research projects, and our R&D Lab department relies on a team of over 500
professionals, which includes researchers and data scientists (both directly part of our R&D Lab
department) and employees in our Development Labs, Competence Centers and Products Labs, who
cooperate closely with our R&D Labs.

We believe that the Be Acquisition enabled us to create a strong industrial combination and to further
consolidate our strong position in the markets served by our Finance industry vertical as well as our
end-to-end capabilities, given Be Group’s large addressable market, underpinned by strong underlying
market trends. Following the completion of the Be Acquisition, we believe we have further increased
potential cross-selling opportunities, by leveraging both our and Be Group’s brand recognition and
strong reputation across our wide platform of customers, while coupling our broad offer of IT services,
software and digital platforms and solutions with top tier consulting services. For example, we have
been deploying an end-to-end platform of solutions aiming to address all of our customers’ IT needs,
by covering the design of their IT architecture as well as the implementation and integration of
proprietary solutions and/or third-party solutions into their systems. Moreover, following completion
of the Be Acquisition, our customer base includes Be Group’s customers, which comprise major
financial and insurance institutions, such as UniCredit, Nexi, MasterCard and Poste Italiane S.p.A.,
along with Italian industrial players, some of which are already customers of the Group. After giving
effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies completed in
2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on January 1,
2022, we estimate that the Be Group would have comprised approximately 16% of the aggregated
revenues of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2022.

**Our Strengths**

**_Leading player in the attractive Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets with strong_**
**_growth driven by digital transformation secular trend_**

The Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets grew at a CAGR of approximately 4.4%
between 2019 and 2021, and were worth approximately €21.8 billion in 2021. In addition, the Italian
ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets are forecast to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% between 2021
and 2025, mainly driven by (i) increasing penetration of the Italian ICT Services and Software &
Solutions markets, which has further accelerated as a result of the growing reliance on remote working
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) digitalization across all private and public clients, and
increasing spending in transformation projects from traditional IT to new digital enabling technologies
and (iii) increasingly mission critical nature of IT services spending.

The Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets have historically been, and remain,
underpenetrated compared to certain equivalent markets in other European countries, according to
management estimates, which we believe provides us with opportunities for significant further growth,
including in connection with the implementation by the Italian government and regulators of policies
that favor digitalization through IT investments, such as the Industry 4.0 plan and the PNRR,
particularly with respect to its “Mission 1”, which allocates a budget of approximately €30 billion to
investments in digitalization, innovation, competitiveness, culture and tourism, and its “Mission 6”,
which allocates a budget of approximately €11 billion to investments in innovation, research and


-----

digitalization of the national healthcare system. These policies are aimed at increasing the penetration
of IT services in Italy and supporting the digital transition in the country, with expected additional
information and communication technology investments, particularly in the areas of connectivity,
digital transition and enhanced digitalization. The following chart shows a breakdown of the PNRR’s
expected investments across its six missions by the end of 2026, along with an overview of certain key
initiatives addressable by the Group included under its “Mission 1” and “Mission 6:”

______________

_Source: Anitec-Assinform for the expected allocation of the PNRR resources by mission, Management analysis for the_

_addressable initiatives under “Mission 1” and “Mission 6” by the Group._

We believe that our strategic positioning and clear focus on innovation and digital transformation
represents a naturally close match to the objectives of PNRR’s “Mission 1” and “Mission 6.” Growth
in the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets is mainly driven by strong ongoing
digitalization across the Italian public and private sectors, with increased IT services spending on and
diversified growth of new digital enabling technologies, such as (i) IoT (which is expected to grow by
approximately 8.8% between 2022 and 2025), (ii) cloud (which is expected to grow by approximately
24.5% between 2022 and 2025), (iii) big data (which is expected to grow by approximately 12.7%
between 2022 and 2025), (iv) cyber security (which is expected to grow by approximately 14.0%
between 2022 and 2025), (v) AI (which is expected to grow by approximately 21.7% between 2022 and
2025 and (vi) blockchain (which is expected to grow by approximately 26.5% between 2022 and 2025),
according to Anitec-Assinform. See “Industry and Market Overview.”

Additionally, growth in IT services spend is also driven by the increasingly mission-critical nature of
IT services in business operations, which we expect to result in IT services spend in Italy becoming
more resilient in the face of future market downturns and less correlated to macroeconomic trends. We
are also seeing an increasing focus on cost efficiency and specialization of IT services, which is leading
companies to rely on external providers rather than developing IT in-house. For example, we have
recently been awarded a multi-vendor tender by CONSIP relating the provision of IT cloud services to
certain Italian public administrations, aimed at driving a migration from on-premises IT services to
cloud. We believe that our size and expertise in complex software, solutions and IT services compared
to some of our smaller competitors and competitors focusing on less complex products and services,


-----

position us well to benefit from such trends, which we expect to be confirmed in the mid- to long term
and that digitalization will increase and accelerate, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In
addition, we believe that our combination with the Be Group enhances our positioning and our ability
to capitalize from increased IT investments by both the Italian government and the private sector.

**_Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets have strong protected local characteristics,_**
**_which advantages local players like us and creates significant barriers to entry for international_**
**_players_**

The Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets are characterized by high barriers to entry,
especially with respect to international competitors, mainly due to cultural and local commercial
complexities, such as language, local regulatory constraints in most markets including banking, energy,
and healthcare, the importance of local relationships and proximity to customers. As a result, we believe
that these barriers favor local players, thus allowing us to capitalize on our leading positioning in the
market for both traditional technologies and digital enabling technologies in Italy, given our deep
knowledge of the domestic market and long-lasting relationships with a wide cross-section of Italian
customers and partners. Italian customers have also shown to prefer software and IT services suppliers
with whom they share a common language, that have extensive operations in Italy and that have an indepth know-how of the applicable Italian legal and regulatory framework, which we believe makes
entering the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets more challenging for international
players.

**_Leading ICT Services and Software & Solutions provider in Italy with strong positions across all_**
**_industry verticals supported by deep technology expertise, strong business process knowledge and_**
**_well-established customer relationships_**

We are a leading ICT Services and Software & Solutions provider in Italy. In 2022, we were the largest
provider of Application & Infrastructure Implementation services in Italy, with a market share of
approximately 13% in terms of revenues compared to the market shares of approximately 11% and 8%
of our two closest competitors, Accenture and Reply, respectively, according to Gartner. Additionally,
in 2022, we were also one of the largest providers of Application Managed Services in Italy, with a
market share of approximately 8% in terms of revenue, compared to the market shares of approximately
24% and approximately 9% of Accenture and Reply, respectively, according to Gartner (see chart
below). We are one of the largest local players in a fragmented market where scale increasingly matters,
and we have a consistent history of market share gain. The addition of the Be Group into our business
has further consolidated this position, particularly in the markets served by our Finance industry
vertical. We believe that the Be Group is a strong player with unique and distinctive capabilities,
extending to both core areas (such as payments and CIB/capital markets), as well as emerging areas of
focus (such as data, analytics, cyber and insurance). The Be Group also provides highly defensible
consulting activities through a combination of proprietary solutions software, digital projects and endto-end vertical projects, which we expect will enable us to expand the breadth of our solutions portfolio
and enrich our Proprietary Solutions and Digitech offerings, while also allowing us to operate through
our new Consulting activities portfolio. We believe that due to a trend among our customers to
consolidate around key partners, large IT service providers such as ourselves are able to absorb a large
portion of IT spend from returning customers.

We hold leading positions across our industry verticals, which are underpinned by our broad offering
of technology solutions, local and regional regulatory knowledge, long-standing relationship with our
customers and partners, reputation for reliable delivery and cost competitiveness. The following table
provides an overview of our market share and positioning for the Application & Infrastructure
Implementation segment across our industry verticals for the year ended December 31, 2021, according
to Gartner:

_Insurance; Energy & Utilities -- Power and Utilities; Industry & Services -- Manufacturing & Natural Resources,_
_Retail, and Transportation; PA & Municipalities, Healthcare -- Education, Government and Healthcare and Life_
_Sciences; Telco & Media -- Communications, Media & Services._

**_Verticalized offerings underpinned by leading niche proprietary software solutions, strong_**
**_technology and digital enabling capabilities, and deep understanding of business core processes_**

We believe that our solutions portfolio, by covering the full spectrum of digital enabling technologies,
is well-placed to address the digitalization trends characterizing the markets in which we operate. In the
year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 26.6% of our revenue from our activities related to
Proprietary Solutions, resulting in solid year-on-year revenue visibility as our proprietary solutions
could neither be implemented nor managed by other IT providers. Compared to the year ended
December 31, 2021, our Proprietary Solutions revenues in 2022 recorded a resilient performance. The
vast majority of revenues generated from our activities related to Proprietary Solutions is now strongly
driven by the sale of software and product-related services following the initial sale of the software
license. Our Proprietary Solutions portfolio enables us to benefit from strong competitive positions in
specific niches, particularly within the Finance, Energy & Utilities, Public Administration, Industry &
Services and Health industry verticals. Our proprietary software solutions portfolio includes four
software suite and 20 smaller products, including (i) _Grace, the leading compliance and risk_
management software program developed for financial institutions, servicing most major banks in Italy,
with a market share estimated to be double that of its closest competitor, (ii) AREAS, one of the largest
digital platforms for the digitalization and integration of clinical and administrative healthcare processes
in the hospital ERP markets and the second largest in the Italian healthcare IT market, (iii) Net@Suite,
the leading cloud-based platform for billing and CRM for all types of sales and distribution operators
in the gas and electricity markets, (iv) JEnte, one of the leading software programs for the digitalization
of processes of Italian municipalities and (v) Ellipse, a software program enabling the total digitalization
of healthcare systems by assisting clinicians in real-time diagnostics, decision and treatment activities
of their patients. Our Proprietary Solutions portfolio targets specific niches across all of our industry
verticals that are highly attractive in light of their regulated nature, the need for highly tailored solutions
and the elevated costs that customers must bear for switching providers. Furthermore, we believe that
the strong reputation of our Proprietary Solutions also allows us to up-sell and cross-sell our System
Integration and Digitech services, although we do not primarily carry out these activities in relation to
proprietary technology. In addition, our Proprietary Solutions also feature digital products including (i)


-----

_Knowage, an open source suite for modern business analytics initiatives from data visualization to deep_
analysis, (ii) _Digital Enabler, a digital platform providing a single point of data knowledge used to_
develop new value added services as well as digitally enabling older technologies and applications and
(iii) Cloudesire, our brokering and monetization platform that enables the immediate distribution of
cloud and digital services, aimed at covering a full end-to-end sell and operate capability model.
Following the completion of the Be Acquisition, our Proprietary Solutions offering has been enriched
by the Be Group’s proprietary solutions for the insurance market (including, among others, its Universo
solution for the life insurance market).

As a result of a strategic review of our business operations and positioning, we now supplement our
strong Proprietary Solutions software offering with our Digitech activities, which are aimed at providing
a cutting-edge portfolio of services for the professional customization of third-party product solutions
and, represented 36.0% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. As part of Digitech, we
offer new and advanced high-growth digital enabling capabilities designed for efficiently interacting
with the relevant third-party software, including advanced analytics, cloud-based services,
cybersecurity, customer experience, IoT, robotic process automation, AR / MR / VR and digital twin
and blockchain platforms. In addition, revenues for both our Proprietary Solutions and Digitech
portfolios are supported by our digital enabling capabilities. Moreover, through our digital services
offering, we have worked on projects including “city-as-a platform” solutions in Italy, with the aim of
increasing the degree of digitalization of the services being offered by private companies and public
entities on integrated technological platforms. We believe that our digital enabling capabilities for both
Proprietary Solutions and Digitech projects have been strengthened as a result of the integration of Be
Group’s digital division into our business, as the Be Group features an engagement hub dedicated to
the development of cutting-edge web, mobile and social media applications for customers, with a focus
on the creation and distribution of digital content and vertical digital solutions.

**_Strong focus on R&D and a highly qualified, digitally-skilled workforce_**

Innovation has always been a key element for our competitiveness and long-term sustainability. We
continuously invest in R&D and innovation to support the ongoing improvement of our organization in
increasing our competitive capacity and fulfilling the needs of a fluid, rapidly changing market. Our
investment in R&D to develop and maintain our research and project management activities has
amounted to approximately €25 million, in the year ended December 31, 2022 and, as of the date of
this Offering Memorandum, we are involved in more than 100 research projects, and our R&D Lab
department relies on a team of over 500 professionals, which includes researchers and data scientists
(both directly part of our R&D Lab department) and employees in our Development Labs, Competence
_Centers and Products Labs, who cooperate closely with our R&D Labs. We also partner with more than_
150 universities globally and have strategic alliances with several research centers globally.

We believe we are among the most active ICT research companies in Europe, attracting funds from
national and EU research programs, being ranked among the top 10 European private for profit
companies (and the first in Italy) in terms of EU funding under the European Union’s Horizon 2020
Programme for Research and Innovation. While, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, no
official documentation has been made available yet by the European Commission, we have been
awarded research funding under the new Horizon Europe 2021-2027 Programme for over 30 initiatives
and are finalizing the grant signature process for further ten initiatives. This confirms our ability to
submit high-quality research projects, and to maintain a strong position within the European research
landscape. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we received €23 million in research funding from
Italian and European research programs.

We also deploy a significant amount of resources for the training of our technology engineers, core
process specialists and digital scientists who support our entire production cycle. Our internal “Enrico
Della Valle” IT & Management Academy, which is considered one of the leading Italian corporate
schools for IT, provides over 500 different course editions, resulting in approximately 32,000 training
days in the year ended December 31, 2022. Our academy issued approximately 1,500 certifications and


-----

trained approximately 6,000 of our employees in the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that
our strong focus on R&D as well as the resources deployed to train our technology engineers, core
process specialists and digital scientists, coupled with our strategic acquisitions, will allow us to
continue to attract and retain skilled employees, despite the constantly increasing talent shortage in the
IT industry, which represents the key challenge in the IT sector.

**_Large and diversified customer base with highly recurring revenues and high levels of customer_**
**_satisfaction_**

We are present in all regions and most metropolitan cities in Italy (including Milan, Rome and Turin)
and operate across several sectors of the economy, including public administration, financial services,
utilities, telecommunications, transportation, infrastructure and healthcare. We have a customer base of
more than 2,750 customers, including large private and blue chip companies and public sector bodies,
among which are six of the largest Italian banks (including Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit and Banco
BPM), major telecommunications and media companies (including Vodafone, TIM and BT), utilities
companies (including Enel and Eni), manufacturing companies (including Stellantis), healthcare
organizations (including the Veneto region healthcare system and other large hospitals in Italy), local
public administrations (including the municipalities of Rome and Milan, as well as the IT services arm
of the Lombardy region, and the Emilia Romagna and Campania regions) and transportation and
infrastructure companies (including Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane). Following the completion of the Be
Acquisition, we believe we have further increased potential cross-selling opportunities, by leveraging
both our and Be Group’s brand recognition and strong reputation across our wide platform of customers,
while coupling our broad offer of IT services, software and digital platforms and solutions with top tier
consulting and digital services. For example, we have been deploying an end-to-end platform of
solutions aiming to address all of our customers’ IT needs, by covering the design of their IT
architecture as well as the implementation and integration of proprietary solutions and/or third-party
solutions into their systems. In addition, we benefit from a high level of exposure to medium and large
enterprise customers compared to other businesses operating within the Italian ICT sector. For the year
ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that approximately 95% of our top 50 customers are large
enterprises or public sector entities and generated 48% of our revenues, in each case after giving effect
to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies completed in 2022
(to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022.
Our business benefits from low customer concentration and significant customer diversification across
all of our industry verticals, with no customer accounting for more than 6.0% of our revenues and no
industry vertical accounting for more than 26.4% of our revenues for the year ended December 31,
2022, in each case after giving effect to the Be Acquisition as if it had been completed on January 1,
2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our top three customers generated approximately 16% of
our revenues, our top five customers generated approximately 22% of our revenues, and our top ten
customers generated approximately 30% of our revenues, in each case after giving effect to the Be
Acquisition as if it had been completed on January 1, 2022.

customer base by size for the year ended December 31, 2022:

**Customer Concentration and Customer Base by Size**

_(1) Aggregated figures for the year ended December 31, 2022, giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the_

_Group of certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they_
_had been completed on January 1, 2022._

_companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on_
_January 1, 2022._

Our customers value our reliability and excellent track record of delivery, local presence and local and
regional regulatory knowledge, cost effective solutions and highly-personalized, best-in-class offering
of proprietary software solutions and digital capabilities, which we believe has contributed to our
consistently high customer retention rates. In particular, our top ten customers by revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2022, have been with us for more than ten years. We are consistently recognized
as one of the best partners in terms of product personalization and contractual terms in Italy and more
than 96% of our customers were “very satisfied,” “satisfied” or “neutral” about our product offering
and services in 2022, according to a customer satisfaction survey that we perform every year on
approximately 170 customers across all of our industry verticals. The following chart provides an
overview of our customer surveys for the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022:

_____________

_(1) “Satisfied” category includes “Very satisfactory”, “Satisfactory” and “Neutral”._
_(2) “Unsatisfied” category includes “Very unsatisfactory” and “Unsatisfactory”._

In addition, a large share of our revenues across each of our activity lines is highly recurring. In
particular, the revenues we generate from our activities related to Proprietary Solutions, accounted for
26.6% of total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022, are highly recurring and demonstrate our


-----

long-lasting relationships with our Proprietary Solutions customers primarily as a result of the local,
highly specialized and customized nature of our Proprietary Solutions as well as their integration into
our end-customers’ IT systems, which also limits competition for our products and services in respect
of those customers. In addition, we consider the revenues we generate from our activities related to
System Integration and relating to the day-to-day management and operation services of our customers’
end-to-end infrastructure to also be recurring, as they are secured by long-term contracts. While
contractual frameworks for managed services provided as part of System Integration are usually three
to five years in length, we generally have long-term relationships with our System Integration customers
and record high levels of contract renewals. In addition, these customers display high retention rates
also due to the difficulty of switching to a different provider. Lastly, a significant portion of revenues
we generate from our activities related to Digitech is backed by high levels of contract renewals and
therefore we consider them to be recurring, also in light of our successful track record of service delivery
and our knowledge of complex IT systems.

The high share of recurring contracts with our existing customers across all of our industry verticals has
allowed us to maintain a stable revenue performance. Moreover, our ability to sell additional valueadded services to existing customers allowed us to increase spending of our existing customers over
time, thus increasing our revenue generation. After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the
acquisition by the Group of Atlantic Technologies as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022, between
January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022, revenues generated from our top five and top ten customers
increased at CAGRs of approximately 18.4*% and 11.7*%, respectively.

**_Strong financial profile with consistent, resilient growth and cash flow generation, with further_**
**_potential to improve margin performance through cost saving initiatives_**

Over the past 20 years, our revenue expansion has been driven by mid- to high single digit organic
growth supported by continuous investments in R&D and training as well as growth from selective
value accretive acquisitions of attractive IT services assets, including, among others, our acquisitions
of Atos Origin Italia in 2008, T-Systems Italia, in 2013, Infogroup in 2017 and the Movilitas group,
Design Automation Associates, C Consulting in 2021, and PluSure S.p.A. and Atlantic Technologies
in 2022. Additionally, our revenues have remained resilient through volatile macroeconomic cycles
during the past 20 years, including through the COVID-19 pandemic, with our revenues’ organic growth
outperforming Italian GDP growth on a year-over-year basis since 2003. For the year ended December
31, 2022, we generated revenues of €1,422.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €207.8 million. In
addition, for the year ended ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a 4.0%* organic growth of our
revenues and, for the same period, a 19.2%* organic growth of our Adjusted EBITDA excluding the
Finance industry vertical from 2021 to 2022.

_accounting errors described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Accounting Errors,” and_
_therefore you should not place undue reliance on such information. See also Note 1.1 to our 2022 Audited Financial_
_Statements describing the correction of major errors under IAS 8, and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business_
_and Industry—We identified certain accounting errors that occurred prior to 2022, which resulted in an overstatement_

_Group of certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if_
_they had been completed on January 1, 2022._

Our business has historically benefitted from high cash conversion (defined as the ratio of Adjusted
EBITDA _less capital expenditure to Adjusted EBITDA, expressed as percentage), which averaged_


-----

approximately 84.5%* annually between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022, as a result of our
robust margin profile and limited capital expenditures from our asset-light model.

Historically, we have also been able to increase our margins as a result of continued operational
improvements and operating leverage, and we believe there is further potential to improve our margins
through operational initiatives. In particular, we have deployed several cost savings initiatives,
including (i) an initiative to streamline and optimize our workforce by facilitating turnover and filling
vacant positions with young, highly-skilled personnel coupled with an increased nearshoring presence,
(ii) the renegotiation of services and utilities contracts relating to our facilities and offices to improve
the terms thereof and (iii) other cost-saving efficiencies resulting from our company-wide transition to
smart working. Several of these measures have now been implemented in our business structure
(including, among others, few initiatives related to our procurement processes).

In addition, in 2022, as part of our ambition to implement a solid cost optimization plan, we started
implementing a comprehensive range of further cost savings and efficiency initiatives aimed at
enhancing our operations and improving our ability to respond to changes in the demand for our
products and solutions, by further increasing the flexibility of our cost structure. In the aggregate, we
expect these cost savings and efficiency initiatives to generate €16.2 million of annual run rate cost
savings by the end of 2023 (€9.8 million of which have been already achieved for the year ended
December 31, 2022), with further room for potential upside. Once achieved, we expect that these cost
savings will structurally reduce the Group’s cost base going forward. Our key cost savings and
efficiency initiatives include: (A) procurement initiatives, consisting of: (i) the streamlining of our
contractual relationships with external IT consultants through the introduction of competitive tender
procedures and a structured supplier qualification process, and (ii) the reduction of costs related to the
procurement of software products, primarily by consolidating our current software providers base into
a limited number of distributors and resellers, and consolidating our IT spend with certain selected
OEMs; (B) optimization initiatives targeting the reduction of utilities, maintenance and rent costs
related to our real estate portfolio, including the reduction of our square footage at multiple locations
and office closures in up to three out of 13 non-strategic locations in Italy as well as the opening of a
new flagship office in Milan (Italy); and (C) a broad range of other cost saving initiatives including the
outsourcing of payroll activities, the implementation of headcount optimization and reduction projects
including nearshoring in Serbia and adjacent countries, rationalization projects aimed at consolidating
our legal structure, and vendor rebate management activities.

**_Attractive consolidation platform with track record of creating value through integration of bolt-on_**
**_acquisitions_**

We believe we are a natural consolidator in the fragmented Italian ICT Services and Software &
Solutions markets and have a strong track-record of successfully integrating acquired entities, allowing
us to expand our product offering and geographic reach, generate significant cross-selling opportunities
into our existing customer base and realize synergies, while fostering future growth. Between January
2020 and December 31, 2022, we completed 9 acquisitions (including the Be Acquisition). Our M&A
strategy also relies on our ability to leverage an enhanced level of competences and stronger R&D
capabilities following the integration of acquired businesses, with the aim of reinforcing our digital
capabilities.

We constantly evaluate opportunities for prudent, highly targeted and strategic bolt-on acquisitions,
with fair acquisition prices typically funded through organic cash flow generation. Over the past five
years, we completed more than 20 bolt-on acquisitions. Past bolt-on acquisitions include (i) Cybertech
Group in 2019, which allowed us to expand our cybersecurity offering and consolidate our leadership
position in the rapidly expanding cybersecurity segment, (ii) Deus Technology in 2019, which allowed
us to expand our finance expertise with wealth management fintech solutions, (iii) Digitelematica in
2019, which allowed us to increase our e-commerce offerings to retail customers, (iv) FDL Servizi in
2020, which allowed us to expand our software solutions for smart-grid management services, (v) C
Consulting in 2021, which allowed us to strengthen our portfolio of proprietary solutions for the


-----

reinsurance market, (vi) Movilitas group in 2021, which consolidated our position in the United States
by expanding our offering of smart solutions for the manufacturing industry, (v) PluSure S.p.A. in 2022,
which allowed us to expand our product design solutions portfolio for our industry 4.0 customers, and
strengthened the positioning of our eXcellence global division on the European markets, and (vi)
Atlantic Technologies S.p.A. in 2022, which allowed us to expand our presence in the cloud technology
area of CRM, ERP and analytics. In particular, these acquisitions enabled us to significantly strengthen
our digital product and service offering in the United States, which resulted in a €56.3 million increase
in revenues generated in the United States, from €15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020,
to €71.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In addition, following completion of the Be Acquisition, we wholly own the Be Group, one of the
leading Italian players in the IT consulting sector and provider of business consulting, information
technology and digital business services to major financial and insurance institutions in Europe,
including Italy. As a result of the Be Acquisition, we expanded our international operations into three
new countries (Albania, Poland and Romania), while also strengthening our presence in the DACH
region (i.e., Germany, Austria and Switzerland). The successful completion of the Be Acquisition
further consolidated our leadership position in the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions
markets, in particular by enabling us to further broaden our best-in-class portfolio of consulting and
digital transformation services to customers in the markets served by our Finance industry vertical.

Through our M&A-focused team, we have developed a disciplined and clear approach to M&A activity,
targeting best-in-class specialized IT services providers with a focus on increasing our higher margin
Proprietary Solutions and Digitech portfolios, complementing our service offering and digital
capabilities by strengthening our industry-vertical specific product portfolio and thus consolidating our
leading positions across our industry verticals in order to strategically support our organic growth.

**_Strong leadership team with proven track record of delivery supported by committed Sponsors_**

Our business is supported by the experience of our senior management team, which benefits from the
experience and knowledge of our Sponsors. Following the Engineering Acquisition, highly experienced
and reputable professionals who are widely recognized for their international track record of operational
excellence and capacity to deliver have joined our senior management team. In 2021, we welcomed our
Chairman, Gaetano Miccichè, who contributes his wide knowledge of the Italian financial landscape,
our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Maximo Ibarra, who brings a wealth of significant experience in
running high profile businesses, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Massimo Cunico, who has a strong
background in the manufacturing business in Italy and internationally. Under their leadership, we have
continued to consolidate our position as one of the leading independent Italian specialist provider of IT
services, software and digital platforms through both organic growth and successful add-on acquisitions
(including the recent acquisition of the Movilitas group in 2021 and the acquisition of Atlantic
Technologies S.p.A. in 2022). Our key management team also includes our industry vertical leaders
and other corporate executives such as our Executive Vice President Digitech Fabio Momola, our Vice
President for the “Enterprise” business unit Guido Porro, our Chief HR Officer Alessia D’Addario, our
Chief Procurement and Strategic Officer Fabio Francalancia, our General Counsel Sabrina delle Curti,
and our Head of M&A Francesco G. Schininà. Our senior management team is supported by a highly
capable, committed and specialized second level management, with a proven track records of
developing and marketing innovative products and solutions, and by our project management office,
which stages 566 certified project management professionals, who ensure solid and innovative
management of our customers’ and our own projects, while enabling us to provide skilled project
management and project management office specialists across all of the markets that we service. We
also benefit from an average of 12,474 highly productive, well-trained employees as at December 31,
2022 (including the Be Group). Our constant priority is to maintain our competitiveness by
strengthening our skillset and the quality of our talent pool. To this end, in 2022 we accelerated the
intake of talent into the Group. Following completion of the Be Acquisition, the Be Group’s day-to-day
operations continue to be managed by Mr. Stefano Achermann (Be’s founder and current Chief
Executive Officer), in order to ensure continuity. Since November 2022, Mr. Achermann also leads our


-----

Finance industry vertical, and is supported by a team that was further strengthened through the addition
of certain managers of the Be Group. We believe that our highly experienced management team will
continue to focus on delivering growth and development of our operations, while ensuring the efficient
integration of the Be Group into our business.

**Our Strategies**

**_Continue to grow and build on our leading market position_**

We are a leading ICT services and Software and Solutions provider in Italy, with a market share of
approximately 13% in Implementation and 8% in Application Managed Services in terms of revenue in
2022, according to Gartner. Our revenues grew at a CAGR of 8.0%* (and at a CAGR of 9.5%, excluding
the results of our Finance industry vertical) between 2020 and December 31, 2022, despite the COVID19 outbreak, thereby contributing towards consolidating our market share in Italy. Excluding the results
of our Finance industry vertical, our organic revenue growth would have would have been 10.0%* over
the same period. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to continue to grow our market share by
capturing the future growth of the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets, benefitting
from increasing penetration, digitalization across all private and public sectors, and increasing spending
on new digital enabling technologies. We believe the successful completion of the Be Acquisition has
enabled us to consolidate our leadership market position in the Finance industry vertical and to grow
our market share in the Italian market and abroad. In particular, following the successful completion of
the Be Acquisition, we are operating from offices in various new countries, including in Central and
Eastern Europe, such as Albania, Poland and Romania, while also strengthening our presence in the
DACH region (i.e., Germany, Austria and Switzerland). We intend to continue to leverage our strong
technological capabilities and broad range of digital solutions which we have successfully implemented
across our activity types, industry verticals and customers to further capture opportunities to cross-sell
and up-sell our products and services. In particular, we believe that the continuing demand for our
digital enabling technologies will present us with an opportunity to further grow our market share in
Italy. Additionally, we plan to continue to center our business around the needs of our loyal customer
base, which we believe will allow us to maintain our track record of growing our digital offerings among
our top customers.

**_Strengthen our advanced technological platform, unrivalled digital capabilities and industry_**
**_partnerships complemented by the Be Group’s proprietary platforms_**

We have a strong track record of product innovation and strive to continuously develop new and tailored
digital offerings to meet our customers’ latest digital needs. Our R&D Lab, which is the core driver of
our products and services innovation process works closely with other units of the company, including
our _Innovators Network, consisting of several innovation experts who analyze market trends and_
weaknesses and translate them into ideas for innovative solutions and products, our Development Labs,
comprising a dedicated group of professionals who develop state-of-the art marketable digital
technologies, and our Products Labs, comprising a dedicated group of professionals who are devoted
to designing, developing and maintaining our proprietary solutions. Leveraging our R&D capabilities,
we intend to further strengthen our technological platform by continuing to invest in key areas, spanning
across all of our industry verticals: cybersecurity, digital industry, smart transportation, smart city, smart
government, smart energy, digital media, cloud, big data, blockchain and AI. For example, in September
2022 we started a strategic collaboration with Leonardo S.p.A., a global leader in the aerospace, defence
& security sector, to identify projects and business opportunities to be developed jointly in the field of
Digital Transformation and Cybersecurity with a particular focus on the defense, healthcare, finance,
public administration and infrastructure sectors, including through joint R&D initiatives. In addition,
following the successful completion of the Be Acquisition, we have enriched our portfolio of proprietary
solutions, strengthening in particular our positioning as a key provider of services to the broader finance
industry.


-----

We also intend to further capitalize on our strong, long-standing relationships with key strategic
partners, who comprise next-generation technology vendors and service providers and include
worldwide leaders in public cloud and SaaS services, such as Amazon Web Services, Google and
Microsoft, ERP and CRM solutions, such as SAP, Oracle, Salesforce and Microsoft, as well as a large
pool of digital technologies providers, such as Adobe, Cisco, RedHat and VMware. We believe that our
focus on strong relationships with key industry partners will continue to allow us to provide our
customers with access to cutting-edge digital platforms and solutions. To that end, in April 2023, we
entered into a binding commitment for a partnership in respect of the digital platform of Illimity, an
established banking digital platform, including exclusive distribution rights relating to such platform
for our Finance industry vertical until 2032. This partnership is currently expected to generate
contractual revenues of €15 million per year until 2032 for the professional services that we are expected
to provide in connection with the distribution of Illimity’s platform to third parties, while also unlocking
potential upsides driven by our exclusive distribution rights, all of which remains subject to the
finalization of the long-form partnership terms, which is expected by the end of June 2023. The total
consideration for the partnership is €55.5 million (which may be increased by €4.5 million between
2024 and 2032), which will be paid in the period from 2023 to 2026, with approximately €10.0 million
paid in 2023 and funded by cash on hand.

**_Increase our offering of Proprietary Solutions and Digitech_**

We believe that our large portfolio of leading, niche vertical proprietary solutions and services supports
our strong reputation as a leading ICT services and Software and Solutions provider in Italy and acts as
a catalyst for our broad service offerings across our industry verticals. Our portfolio of Proprietary
Solutions, which primarily targets customers in our Finance, Energy & Utilities, Public Administration,
Industry & Services and Health industry verticals, has also historically contributed to our strong margins
and highly sticky, recurring revenue from long-term, strategic customer relationships.

In addition to our Proprietary Solutions portfolio, we believe that our reputation and market positioning
are complemented by our portfolio of highly customized Digitech solutions, which we believe allows
us to cover the full spectrum of digital enabling technologies and continue to deliver cutting-edge highsolutions to our customers, capable of being integrated with both third-party and client-owned
applications.

We also intend to continue leveraging our in-house R&D capabilities and developing digital enabling
proprietary solutions to the activities we conduct in relation to Proprietary Solutions. Among others,
our existing portfolio includes Eng-DE4Bios, a system empowered by digital enabling technologies to
integrate and harmonize data available to local government and healthcare systems in Veneto, allowing
for the identification of incidences of COVID-19 infections across a defined territory. We are also
developing selected POC projects to be deployed in the metaverse space, focusing on the following
areas: government, healthcare, retail, tourism and education. In addition, at the end of 2022, we signed
a strategic partnership agreement with Novartis Italia, leader in the medical-scientific research, for the
development of initiatives and solutions aimed at responding to the challenges of “Mission 6” of the
PNRR by accelerating the digital transition of the Italian healthcare system through the introduction of
cutting-edge technologies in care services, patient care and healthcare facility management. Moreover,
in early 2023, we won, as part of temporary business grouping, a 10-year concession by AGENAS for
the design, implementation, and management of the National Telemedicine Platform PNT as the lead
contractor. The platform will be entirely cloud-based and will ensure interoperability and integration.
In particular, the PNT aims to connect the central administration with local administrations, favoring
the centralized governance and monitoring of telemedicine processes implemented at the regional level,
in line with “Mission 6” of the PNRR.


-----

**_Increase profitability and cash generation, including through the implementation of cost savings and_**
**_efficiency initiatives_**

We intend to continue leveraging our diversified operating platform and realizing economies of scale
to improve our margins. We intend to increase the share of proprietary software and related services,
which typically generate comparably higher margins due to the significant customization of our
products and services and often result in long-term customer relationships and recurring business.

Our business has historically benefitted from high cash conversion, which averaged approximately
84.4%* annually between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022, as a result of our robust margin
profile from underlying operating leverage and limited capital expenditures from our asset-light model,
as well as stable revenue and consistent Adjusted EBITDA (which grew at a CAGR of 8.0%* and
8.3%* between the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2022, and at a
CAGR of 9.5%* and 15.1%* over the same period, in each case excluding the results of our Finance
industry vertical). Our organic revenue growth was 6.7%* in the year ended December 31, 2021 and
4.0%* in the year ended December 31, 2022 (from €1,298.0* million in 2021 to €1,349.5 million in
2022). Excluding our Finance industry vertical from 2021 to 2022, our organic revenue growth would
have been 10.0%* (from €1,018.9* million in 2021 to €1,120.3 million in 2022). While our organic
Adjusted EBITDA growth was a negative 0.4% in 2022 (from €198.3* million in 2021 to €197.5 million
in 2022), excluding our Finance industry vertical from 2021 to 2022, our organic Adjusted EBITDA
growth would have been 19.2%* (from €125.1* million in 2021 to €149.2 million in 2022). To increase
our cash generation, we intend to continue implementing a disciplined approach to working capital
management and capital expenditure, which averaged approximately 2%* of revenues annually
between 2020 and 2022.

To further increase our profitability and leverage the potential to further improve our margins, we also
plan to continue focusing on implementing cost-savings measures and improve operational efficiency
across the Group. To this end, in 2022 we started implementing a comprehensive range of cost savings
and efficiency initiatives aimed at enhancing our operations and improving our ability to respond to
changes in the demand for our products and solutions, by further increasing the flexibility of our cost
structure. In the aggregate, we expect our cost savings and efficiency initiatives to generate €16.2
million of run rate cost savings by the end of 2023 (€9.8 million of which have been already achieved
for the year ended December 31, 2022). Our key cost savings and efficiency initiatives include: (A)
procurement initiatives, consisting of: (i) the streamlining of our contractual relationships with external
IT consultants through the introduction of competitive tender procedures and a structured supplier
qualification process, and (ii) the reduction of costs related to the procurement of software products,
primarily by consolidating our current software providers base into a limited number of distributors and
resellers, and consolidating our IT spend with certain selected OEMs; (B) optimization initiatives
targeting the reduction of utilities, maintenance and rent costs related to our real estate portfolio,
including the reduction of our square footage at multiple locations and office closures in up to three out
of 13 non-strategic locations in Italy as well as the opening of a new flagship office in Milan (Italy);
and (C) a broad range of other cost saving initiatives including the outsourcing of payroll activities, the
implementation of headcount optimization and reduction projects including nearshoring in Serbia and
adjacent countries, rationalization projects aimed at consolidating our legal structure, and vendor rebate
management activities.

In addition, we believe that our combination with the Be Group will deliver significant value generation,
creating an established player with strong end-to-end capabilities in the financial services sector. By the
end of 2024, we expect to generate approximately €9.5 million of further cost savings in connection
with the integration of the Be Group into our business, which we expect will structurally reduce our
cost base going forward. In connection with the achievement of these synergies, on the basis of
management estimates, we expect that we will incur one-off costs of approximately €5.0 million in
2023 and €10.0 million in 2024. We expect to realize these cost savings through initiatives related to
(i) the optimization of our subcontractor and procurement relationships, the optimization of external
workforce utilization rates and the deployment of near-shoring initiatives, (ii) the optimization and


-----

consolidation of the Group’s and Be’s combined real estate footprint and costs, (iii) the consolidation
of the Group’s and Be’s staff and administrative functions, and (iv) the reduction of compliance
expenses following the Delisting of the Be Group upon completion of the Be Acquisition.

**_Continue to pursue targeted and opportunistic acquisitions to expand capabilities and grow the_**
**_business_**

The Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets remain highly fragmented, and we intend
to further strengthen our leading position and broaden our product portfolio by continuing to consolidate
smaller players. We have developed a disciplined and systematic approach to M&A activity, targeting
best-in-class specialized IT services providers with a focus on increasing our Proprietary Solutions
portfolio, consolidating our leading positions across our industry verticals and strategically
complementing our organic growth. We execute our M&A strategy through our dedicated and
experienced in-house M&A team, who have completed 9 M&A deals between January 1, 2020 and
December 31, 2022, including the Be Acquisition. We believe that this continued focus on acquiring
and integrating best-in-class providers of IT services will allow us to further cross-sell acquired
solutions into our existing customer base and strengthen our R&D capabilities.

We will continue to evaluate opportunities for highly targeted, strategic bolt-on acquisitions, in Italy
and abroad, with a view to expanding our existing product offerings, strengthening our industry-vertical
specific product offerings and increasing our share of revenues from IP and digital capabilities. Key
recent, targeted acquisitions that have allowed us to grow our portfolio and address customers’ needs
include FDL Servizi in 2020, which allowed us to expand our software solutions for smart-grid
management services, C Consulting in 2021, which allowed us to strengthen our portfolio of proprietary
solutions for the reinsurance market, Movilitas group in 2021, which consolidated our position in the
United States by expanding our offering of smart solutions for the manufacturing industry, PluSure
S.p.A. in 2022, which allowed us to expand our product design solutions portfolio for our industry 4.0
customers, and Atlantic Technologies S.p.A. in 2022, which allowed us to expand our presence in the
cloud technology area of CRM, ERP and analytics and increase our exposure to high digital growth
platforms, while strengthening our consulting capabilities. Specifically as a result of recent bolt-on
acquisitions in the United States, we significantly strengthened our local footprint and solutions
portfolio breadth, which resulted in a €56.3* million increase in revenues generated in the United States,
from €15.2* million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €71.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022.

In addition, following completion of the Be Acquisition, we wholly own the Be Group, one of the
leading Italian players in the IT consulting sector and provider of business consulting, information
technology and digital business services to major financial and insurance institutions in Europe,
including Italy. We believe that the successful completion of the Be Acquisition has further consolidated
our leadership position in the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets, in particular by
enabling us to further broaden our best-in-class portfolio of consulting and digital transformation
services to customers in the markets served by our Finance industry vertical. We expect that the ongoing
combination of our business with the Be Group will provide potential upside opportunities for revenue
and profitability growth, including by unlocking revenue synergies and by enabling us to serve as a
one-stop-shop for top-tier ITC and consulting services. In particular, we expect opportunities for
revenue synergies to arise from the cross-selling of both our and Be Group’s products, the integration
of our and Be Group’s end-to-end systems and the increase of our share of captured customer spending,
through a joint new approaching strategy aimed at tier 2 banks and insurance companies.

We continue to see interesting acquisition opportunities across verticals and consider as highly
complementary to our business strategy targets that can contribute to the even development of our
verticals, in particular industrials, finance, utilities and healthcare, as well as add to our delivery
capabilities outside of Italy.

**Our History**

We were founded by Michele Cinaglia, in 1980 in Padua as part of the Cerved group. Over the course
of 40 years, we have grown both organically and through acquisitions to become the leading specialist
provider of IT services, software and digital platforms in Italy.

Following a management buyout in 1984, we became a standalone entity and continued to grow
organically and through strategic acquisitions within the public and financial services sectors until our
initial public offering and listing on the Electronic Share Market (Mercato Telematico Azionario or
MTA) organized and managed by Borsa Italiana in 2000. Between 2001 and 2005, we further expanded
our operations in Italy through various strategic bolt-on acquisitions, including the acquisition of
OverIT, a company focused on the optimization of field processes with cutting-edge technologies
(which we spun off in 2021), Nexen, an IT consulting firm for both traditional and new technologies,
including robotic process automation, big data, cloud, open banking and AI, and Olivetti Sanità, a
leading IT provider of services for the healthcare industry. In 2008, through the acquisition of Atos
Origin Italia, an international IT services company, we reinforced our capacities to deliver high quality
and innovative IT services to customers in the infrastructure industry. We subsequently continued our
geographic expansion into the United States, through the acquisition of Dynpro, a company specialized
in software design and development, managed services, IT consulting and IT staffing. We reinforced
our presence in the market for mobile applications through the acquisition of Xaltia, a company
providing value added services on mobile platforms, offering mobile applications and content
development. We also expanded into Germany, through the acquisition of DST Consulting GmbH, a
digitalization specialist operating throughout Germany with more than 300 employees in twelve
locations. In 2008, we established a subsidiary in Brazil to support our customer TIM in its expansion
into Brazil. In 2013, we also completed the strategic acquisition of the Italian branch of T-Systems, a
global IT services and consulting company, consolidating our presence in Italy.

Following our take-private by NB Renaissance (NBRP Fund I, NBRP Annex and co-investors) and
Apax in 2016, we continued to grow our business, product and IT services offering organically and
through strategic acquisitions, such as our acquisition of Infogroup in 2017, a company specialized in
IT services for the financial industry in Germany and other German- language countries, Cybertech
Group in 2019, which allowed us to expand our cyber technology offering, and Deus Technology in
2019, which allowed us to expand our offerings with wealth management fintech solutions. In 2020,
we completed the acquisition of FDL Servizi, a company providing software for smart gridmanagement.

In July 2020, we were acquired by the Sponsors with the aim to strengthen our leading position, product
and IT service offering in Italy and continue to support our principal Italian clients as they grow
internationally. In 2021, we completed several additional acquisitions in Italy and abroad. In Italy, we
acquired the smart working and collaboration platform for businesses from Livebox S.r.l., Nexera
S.p.A., a company specializing in the provision of IT solutions for advanced security systems and
healthcare through proprietary solutions, as well as C Consulting S.p.A., a company operating in the
reinsurance market, which enabled us to both enrich our product portfolio dedicated to financial
institutions and insurance companies through high quality proprietary solutions and to expand our IFRS
and Solvency II consulting capabilities. In addition, we significantly expanded our footprint in the
United States through the acquisition of a business unit of Design Automation Associates Inc., a digital
automation player focusing on product design, analysis and test engineering, and the Movilitas Group,
an established U.S. player in the consulting space offering smart solutions for the manufacturing
industry which enhanced our industry 4.0 offering in the areas of product tracking and tracing, digital
twin, asset performance management and warehouse management. As part of our growth strategy, in
2021 we also completed the spin-off of our subsidiary OverIT S.p.A., which has exited the consolidation
perimeter of the Group with effect from December 1, 2021. In 2022, we continued to strengthen our
portfolio by completing the acquisition of PluSure S.p.A., an Italian company specialized in product
lifecycle management solutions, which allowed us to expand our product design solutions portfolio for
our industry 4.0 customers, and strengthened the positioning of our eXcellence global division on the


-----

European markets. In addition, in 2022 we completed the acquisition of Atlantic Technologies S.p.A.,
an Italian company specialized in implementing cloud technology in the area of CRM, ERP and
analytics. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition of Operations—Key
_Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Acquisitions and Disposals.”_

In July 2022, we entered into the Be Acquisition Agreement and on the First Be Acquisition Closing
Date, we completed the Initial Acquisition. Between the First Be Acquisition Closing Date and
December 28, 2022, we acquired all the remaining shares of Be through the Market Purchases, the
Mandatory Offer and the Squeeze-Out. As a result, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum we
wholly own the Be Group. The Be Group is one of the leading Italian players in the IT consulting sector
and provides business consulting, information technology and digital business services to major
financial and insurance institutions in Europe, including Italy. We believe that the Be Acquisition
enabled us to create a strong industrial combination and to further consolidate our strong position in the
markets served by our Finance industry vertical as well as our end-to-end capabilities, given Be Group’s
large addressable market, underpinned by strong underlying market trends and a large customer base.
See “—Our Business—The Be Group.”

**Our Business**

**_Activities_**

Following a strategic review of our business operations and positioning, beginning on January 1, 2022,
we offer our IT services, software and digital platforms to our customers by engaging in three distinct
activity types: Proprietary Solutions, Digitech and System Integration. Compared to our former
activities split, our Proprietary Solutions portfolio has remained substantially unchanged (the main
difference being the impact of the spin-off of our subsidiary OverIT in 2021) and encompasses all
solutions embedding software products for which we retain exclusive ownership (regardless of whether
such solutions relate to high technological or traditional products), while our previous allocation of
services and products between Application Transformation and Managed Services has been further
refined to reflect our new strategy in targeting customers by activity types to achieve competitive
advantages. In particular, through our new Digitech activities we aim to consolidate our entire portfolio
of professional IT solutions for high-technology third-party products into a new comprehensive hub,
while through our new System Integration activities we aim to focus on offering solutions for the
management of traditional IT systems and customer infrastructure, thereby enhancing our support
capabilities. Moreover, following the completion of the Be Acquisition, we offer a large portion of Be’s
products and solutions portfolio through a fourth separate activity types, (iv) Consulting, while the
remaining portion of Be’s portfolio has been allocated to, and is offered as part of, our existing three
activities.

We believe that our activities distinction enables us to separate our high-growth Digitech offering from
the customized, end-to-end Proprietary Solutions offerings that we develop for individual customers
and from the IT services, including third-party, that we provide and manage on behalf of our customers
through our activities relating to System Integration.

_Proprietary Solutions_

Our activities relating to Proprietary Solutions include a wide range of cutting-edge, customized, endto-end IT services, such as industry-specific, innovative vertical software and related services. We often
develop our Proprietary Solutions software products in cooperation with our customers and tailor them
to address our customers’ specific needs. Typically, we retain exclusive ownership of these products
and we make them available to the customers with whom they have been developed on the basis of
individually negotiated licensing and subscription agreements that limit their ability to license out or
modify such products as well as to use other competing software products. In addition, our Proprietary
Solutions products portfolio consists in significantly customized and highly specialized products and
services that we integrate into our end-customers’ IT systems. As part of our activities related to


-----

Proprietary Solutions we provide day-to-day management services with respect to our proprietary
products, including consulting services, service desks and help desk support.

In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately 26.6% of our revenues from our
activities related to Proprietary Solutions.

_Digitech_

Our activities relating to Digitech comprise the development and customization of high-growth digital
enabling solutions using advanced analytics, cloud, cybersecurity, customer experience, IoT, robotic
process automation, AR / MR / VR, digital twin and blockchain technologies in cooperation with our
partners, including, among others, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, SAS, IBM and Oracle. In addition,
Digitech includes activities related to strategic partnerships with major software vendors including,
among others, Salesforce and SAP. We provide our Digitech activities on the basis of software and
other technological products that are non-proprietary, with the aim of offering highly customized
solutions capable of being integrated with both third-party and client-owned applications. In particular,
we provide our customers with (i) application development services, through which we create, maintain
and manage customized applications and (ii) integration services, through which we develop, manage
and integrate software and applications of some of the most advanced global IT technology providers
(including Microsoft, SAP and Salesforce) into our customers’ systems and provide related consultancy
and design services. In addition, as part of our Digitech portfolio we support, maintain and update third
party applications and offer project-based system integration services for customers as well as software
providers. Following the acquisition of Atlantic Technologies in 2022, we offer its services as part of
our Digitech portfolio.

In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately 36.0% of our revenue from our
activities related to Digitech.

_System Integration_

Our activities relating to System Integration comprise integration services related to the
implementation, management and maintenance of traditional IT solutions, as well as day-to-day
management and operation services of our customers’ end-to-end infrastructure (including, among
others, hosting and desktop management activities). In addition, our System Integration activities
portfolio comprises other specialized services, such as complex information systems, customized
system architectures and applications integration services for both new or existing hardware and
software.

In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately 32.4% of our revenue from our
activities related to System Integration.

_Consulting_

Following the completion of the Be Acquisition, we offer a large portion of the Be Group’s products
and solutions portfolio through our new activity line, Consulting. In particular, our Consulting activities
comprise the business consulting, information technology and digital business services offered by the
Be Group, mainly to major financial and insurance institutions in Europe, including Italy. See “—The
_Be Group.”_

In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately 5.0% of our revenue from our
activities related to Consulting.

**_Industry Verticals_**

We operate each of our activity types across six distinct industry verticals, each of which is described
in detail below. Our flexible structure and well-diversified products and services offering enable us to


-----

cross-sell to our customers in different industry verticals (for example, our cybersecurity and cloud
services are sold across all of our industry verticals). In addition, in 2022 we started implementing a
strategic initiative focusing on the consolidation of our Energy & Utilities, Industry & Services and
Telco & Media industry verticals into a new business unit, “Enterprise,” with the aim to strengthen our
role in rapidly evolving markets. In addition, for internal reporting purposes, in 2023 we consolidated
our Health and Public Administration industry verticals into our new “Public Sector” business unit. In
particular, we believe that through “Enterprise” we will increase the coordination between our industry
verticals, while unlocking the ability to develop high-quality digital systems for the delivery of crossdomain solutions.

_Finance_

Leveraging on our strong regulatory and market knowledge as well as our integrated offering of AI,
advanced analytics, cybersecurity, robotic process automation, cloud, digital twin, blockchain and
digital workplace, we offer customers in our Finance Industry vertical IT services relating to funds
administration, payments and settlements, regulatory compliance, risk management and credit
management. Through the provision of these services and technologies we assist our customers in
transforming data, managing processes, transitioning into open ecosystems, and optimizing internal
processes to reduce friction. For example, in recent years, we have assisted and continue to assist several
financial institutions in connection with the increasing digitalization of their processes and activities
following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in the upscaling of their
innovation efforts and the review of their existing organizational models.

Our Proprietary Solutions offering in our Finance industry vertical comprises four distinct product
suites: (i) application infrastructure, data management, governance, risk, regulatory and compliance,
(ii) digital customers and credit (iii) digital advisory and sales and (iv) digital payments and settlements.
Our proprietary product offering within the application infrastructure, data management, governance,
risk, regulatory and compliance product suite includes infrastructure services that allow our customers
to better understand their data and increase the reliability of their data-driven practices such as μSE, a
software program used to create solutions that comply with the EU Open Platform Regulatory
Directives, Grace, one of the leading compliance and risk management software programs developed
for financial institutions and DATÆLL, a software program that uses a shared data model to process
customers’ big data (or “data lake”), distilling information from such data while also managing both
traditional and AI and machine learning cognitive algorithms. Our proprietary product offering within
the digital customers and credit product suite includes Claps, a modular software solution for the
management of end-to-end credit processes through digital transformation and process automation. The
proprietary products that we offer within the digital advisory and sales product suite include T1, a multiobjective consultancy platform for the financial, insurance, and credit sectors which aims to offer end
customers a global vision of their current and future needs and also includes a robo-advisory services
platform for the automated and algorithmic management of investments portfolios. The proprietary
products that we offer within the digital payments and settlements product suite include Hycards, a
consolidated software hub for the management of membership cards, loyalty programs and for the
optimization of relationships with customers. In addition, our proprietary solution XLayers provides a
comprehensive package enabling end-to-end management of all inbound and outbound reinsurance
processes, as well as management services covering the full spectrum of related cessions and
retrocessions.

The activities we conduct in relation to Digitech in our Finance industry vertical include the
development, customization and integration of digital software and digital solutions in the areas of
regulatory compliance, cybersecurity, customer experience, risk management and governance, as well
as digital services, such as banking and insurance, instant payments, eVending and crowdfunding.

Our System Integration activities in our Finance industry vertical include the provision of infrastructure
services and call-center support activities as well as integration services for traditional IT solutions.


-----

In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenues of €291.7 million, or 21% of our total
revenues, and Adjusted EBITDA of €57.0 million, or 27% of our total Adjusted EBITDA, from the
Finance industry vertical.

Following completion of the Be Acquisition, we integrated a large portion of the Be Group’s product
and solutions portfolio into the offering of our Finance industry vertical. After giving effect to the Be
Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the
extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022, we
estimate that the revenues of the Be Group allocated to our Finance industry vertical would have
comprised approximately 50% of the aggregated revenues of the Group generated by the Finance
industry vertical in the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, after giving effect to the Be
Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies completed in 2022 (to the
extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022, we
estimate that for the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue from the Finance industry vertical would
have represented approximately 29% of the aggregated revenues of the Group. For a description of Be’s
business, see “—Our Business—The Be Group.”

_Health_

In our Health industry vertical, we provide hospitals and other organizations in the healthcare industry
with a variety of Proprietary Solutions, such as AREAS, a proprietary platform for the digitalization
and integration of clinical and administrative healthcare processes and Ellipse, a software program
enabling the total digitalization of healthcare systems by assisting clinicians in real-time diagnostics,
decision and treatment activities of their patients.

The activities we conduct in relation to Digitech in our Health industry vertical include the development
and customization of software and digital solutions in the areas of clinical and administrative
governance, diagnostics, clinical treatment and care as well as prevention. Additionally, we offer our
customers other innovative IT services and applications, such as tele-health, patient relationship
management and cybersecurity. On occasion, we engage in these activities together with our partners,
which are typically small, local partners that we identify on an ad hoc basis to integrate our product and
service offering. We also manage various support activities, including accounting, finance and logistics,
for healthcare facilities in multiple Italian regions, including Sardinia, Veneto, Emilia Romagna,
Marche, Toscana and Lazio. We leveraged our ability to serve customers across different industry
verticals from one integrated platform with the creation of Digital Enabler, a data- and cloud-native bio
surveillance system, which we named Eng-DE4Bios. While being initially designed as a smart city
platform for monitoring air pollution and lighting, following the COVID-19 outbreak Eng-DE4Bios has
been redesigned in order to utilize our digital enabling technologies to integrate and harmonize data
available to local government and healthcare systems in Veneto, allowing for the identification of
incidences of COVID-19 infections across a defined territory, and thereby enabling healthcare
authorities to weigh responses and impose targeted lockdown and other restrictive measures. EngDE4Bios also carries out predictive analysis to identify where COVID-19 infections are most likely to
spread, allowing for the optimal allocation of scarce healthcare resources. We believe that EngDE4Bios can potentially be employed to carry out predictive analysis on additional, different datasets.
Furthermore, we assisted Regione Lombardia, Regione Toscana and Regione Puglia with the
implementation and management of their COVID-19-vaccination online platforms.

Our System Integration in our Health industry vertical include clinical assistance and emergency
management.

In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenues of €117.0 million, or 8% of our total
revenues, and Adjusted EBITDA of €25.6 million, or 12% of our total Adjusted EBITDA, from the
Health industry vertical.


-----

After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies
completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on
January 1, 2022, we estimate that for the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue from the Health
industry vertical would have represented approximately 7% of the aggregated revenues of the Group.

_Industry & Services_

We provide a wide range of IT and outsourcing services and technologies to customers across various
industries, including the manufacturing, retail, fashion, agriculture and transportation industries.

In our Industry & Services industry vertical, our Proprietary Solutions offering includes Dive Suite, an

deployment in metaverse scenarios. We also help retailers and fashion companies to revolutionize the
customer shopping experience and, at the same time, streamline their operations, reduce costs and
increase revenues with software such as MARKETSUITE, a platform by Digitelematica, one of our
subsidiaries, providing e-commerce and digital distribution solutions for large supermarkets and
hypermarkets. In the agriculture industry, we have developed technologies to analyze microclimates

diseases, which have been implemented to assist customers such as the Maison Anselmet winery in
maintaining the yield of their highest value vineyard despite adverse climactic conditions.

After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies
completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on

& Media industry vertical.

After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies
completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on
January 1, 2022, we estimate that for the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue from the Telco &
Media industry vertical would have represented approximately 7% of the aggregated revenues of the
Group.

_Energy & Utilities_

Leveraging on our strong regulatory and market knowledge, we provide customers in our Energy &

**_The Be Group_**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we own, through Overlord Bidco, 100% of Be’s share

Following the successful completion Be Acquisition, we have integrated a large portion of the Be
Group’s product and solutions portfolio into the offering of our Finance industry vertical, while the
remaining portion of Be group’s portfolio has been allocated to, and is offered as part of, our Public
Administration and Industry & Services industry verticals. As regards the integration with our activity
types, following the successful completion of the Be Acquisition, we have integrated portions of Be
Group’s solutions into our Proprietary Solutions portfolio (including, among others, Be Group’s
proprietary digital platforms), Digitech portfolio (including, among others, certain of Be Group’s ICT
solutions), and System Integration portfolio (including, among others, the activities of Be’s subsidiary
Be Digitech Solutions S.p.A.). We also established a new activity line, Consulting, which will comprise
the business consulting, information technology and digital business services offered by the Be Group.
In addition, pursuant to the Be Reinvestment and Shareholders Agreement, following the successful
completion of the Be Acquisition, we agreed to (i) transfer certain ICT business activities of Be to the
Group by carving out Be’s subsidiary Be Digitech Solutions S.p.A. (excluding its advisory business
unit) and integrate such activities into our Digitech portfolio, and (ii) identify a new potential “Digital
Engagement Activities” commercial unit as part of the integration of Be’s digital activities into our
digital portfolio. As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, these transactions have not yet been
completed. We believe that the completion of the Be Acquisition consolidates our role as a strategic
digital enabler, specifically by creating a strong industrial combination and enhancing our position in
the markets served by our Finance industry vertical.

We believe that the successful completion of the Be Acquisition has further consolidated our leadership
position in the Italian ICT Services and Software & Solutions markets, in particular by enabling us to
further broaden our best-in-class portfolio of consulting and digital transformation services to customers
in the markets served by our Finance industry vertical. We plan to leverage Be Group’s specialization
in management consulting solutions, in order to strengthen our vast portfolio of proprietary solutions
and digital capabilities in the Finance industry vertical. Following the completion of the Be Acquisition,
the Be Group has maintained a degree of autonomy within our Group, and focuses its operations towards
providing management consulting services connected to modern digital transformation processes. In


-----

addition, the Be Group also continues to offer cutting-edge solutions in partnership with leading
international solution vendors.

**Customers**

We have a large and diversified customer base of more than 2,750 customers, including large private
and blue chip companies and public sector bodies. We also serve small and medium sized enterprises
as well as other micro-businesses. Our business benefits from low customer concentration and
significant customer diversification across all of our industry verticals, with no customer accounting for
more than 6.0% of our revenues and no industry vertical accounting for more than 26.4% of our
revenues, in each case, in the year ended December 31, 2022 (without giving effect of the spin-off of
OverIT). We serve our customers through operations covering 20 countries worldwide including major
European countries (such as Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom),
the United States and Latin American countries, such as Brazil. For the year ended December 31, 2022,
we generated 18.3% of our revenues outside of Italy. Moreover, following the completion of the Be
Acquisition, we strengthened our international operations, as we offer Be Group’s products and services
in three additional new countries (Poland, Romania and Albania), and increased our presence in
Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

We seek to create long-term, strategic relationships with our customers, and aim to become an integral
part of their businesses. We benefit from long-lasting customer relationships, with an average tenure of
more than ten years, and a significant degree of customer loyalty, built on our track-record of costeffective service delivery and customized proprietary solutions, local regulatory and market knowledge
as well as know-how of complex IT architectures. We are consistently recognized as one of the best
partners in terms of product personalization and contractual terms in Italy and more than 96% of our
customers were “very satisfied,” “satisfied” or “neutral” about our product offering and services in
2022, according to a customer satisfaction survey that we perform every year on approximately 170
customers across all of our industry verticals. In the year ended December 31, 2022, our top ten
customers accounted for approximately 30% of our revenues, after giving effect to the Be Acquisition
as if it had been completed on January 1, 2022.

In the Finance industry vertical, we primarily serve banking, insurance, capital markets and other
financial institutions, including six of the largest Italian financial institutions, such as Intesa Sanpaolo,
UniCredit and UBI Banca. In the insurance sector, our customers include Generali and Cattolica.
Despite the typical short-term duration of contracts in our Finance industry vertical, which mainly
reflects the annual nature of many of our customers budgeting, we benefit from longstanding
relationships with our customers in the Finance industry vertical, with an average relationship tenure
which has historically been long. Recently, multi-year contracts with a duration of more than three years
are becoming more common in the Finance industry vertical. Following the completion of the Be
Acquisition, our customer base has further increased through the addition of Be Group’s customers,
which include major financial and insurance institutions (some of which have been our historical
customers), such as UniCredit, Intesa Sanpaolo, HSBC, MasterCard, Poste Italiane S.p.A. and Nexi,
along with Italian industrial players.

In the Public Administration industry vertical, we primarily serve municipalities and local public
administrations. Our customers in the Public Administration industry vertical include various regions
(Emilia Romagna and Campania, among others), Aria S.p.A., the IT services arm of the Lombardy, and
municipalities, including the municipalities of Rome and Milan. We support various regional
governments in the digital transformation of their processes and services in many domain areas, such
as financial management, human resources management, real estate and movable asset management,
environmental and territorial management, welfare, agriculture, culture, tourism and mobility. Our
customers in the public sector also include ministries (such as the Italian Ministry of Justice) and large
entities serving governmental administrations such as Sogei, the IT arm of the Ministry of Economy
and Finance, and INPS, the administrator of the Italian pension system. We also have a long-term
contract with Poste Italiane, the Italian national postal service, for the provision of digital services. Our


-----

overall average relationship tenure in the Public Administration industry vertical is approximately ten
years, with an average relationship with municipalities and other customers in the public sector of five
and ten years, respectively.

In the Health industry vertical, we serve large providers of healthcare services, including various
regional governments such as Regione Veneto, Regione Lombardia, Regione Emilia Romagna, Regione
Toscana, Regione Marche, Regione Lazio and large hospitals such as the Sant’Andrea, San Giovanni
and Policlinico Gemelli hospitals in Rome, the Federico II hospital in Naples and hospitals in Turin,
Bologna and Modena. We have been present in the healthcare industry for over 25 years and serve
approximately 150 customers which represent approximately 60% of Italian healthcare organizations.
Our average relationship tenure with customers in the Health industry vertical is of approximately ten
years.

In the Industry & Services industry vertical, our customers include providers of rail services such as the
Italian state-owned railway company, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, road management companies, such
as Autostrade per l’Italia, the largest Italian highway management and maintenance company. We also
serve large corporations such as Stellantis, Whirlpool, Costa Crociere and Ferrero, as well as large
industrial manufacturers and many automotive supply chains, including more than 10,000 dealers and
automotive workshops globally. Our average relationship tenure with customers in the Industry &
Services industry vertical is approximately ten years.

In the Telco & Media industry vertical, we serve major telecommunications and media providers in
Italy, such as TIM, Vodafone and BT. Our average relationship tenure with customers in the Telco &
Media industry vertical is approximately ten years.

In the Energy & Utilities vertical, we serve the largest energy and utilities providers in Italy, including
Enel, the leading Italian electricity generation and distribution provider, and Eni, the leading Italian gas
supplier. Our average relationship tenure with customers in the Energy & Utilities industry vertical is
approximately ten years.

**Material Contracts**

Our contracts have terms that differ depending on whether we are contracting with public or private
sector customers. The following is an overview of the typical structures of our public and private sector
customer contracts, along with summaries of some of our key contracts.

**_Public sector contracts_**

The majority of our contractual relationships within the public sector are governed by framework
agreements that are awarded by appointed public procurement bodies pursuant to competitive public
tenders. A framework agreement is typically granted to one or more suppliers, or to a consortium of
suppliers, based on a selection process involving an economic and technical evaluation of bids. Each
framework agreement sets forth a catalogue of products and services that the supplier can provide and
the terms governing the provision of such products and services over the duration of the framework
agreement, including the maximum quantity and value of products and services to be provided.
Throughout the duration of the framework agreement, the appointed procurement bodies may submit
individual purchase orders to the suppliers for products and services. The duration of framework
agreements typically ranges from two to five years with an option for the customer to extend the
agreement by an additional year at the end of the framework period.

After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies
completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on
January 1, 2022, our largest customer and our top ten customers in the public sector accounted for
approximately 2.0% and 11.8%, respectively, of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.


-----

Generally, public sector contracts do not include automatic price adjustments mechanisms, including in
relation to inflation.

**_Private sector contracts_**

In the private sector, our contracts are generally awarded based on competitive bidding, with key terms
varying depending on the services rendered. In the IT Services area, the typical contract duration is
shorter compared to our public sector contracts and between one and two years, with fee structures
ranging from daily fees and as-a-service fees to on-premises license fees. Performance under our IT
services contracts is generally measured on the basis of response, delivery and troubleshooting times
and service availability. Generally, private sector contracts feature renewal clauses, but do not include
automatic price adjustments mechanisms, including in relation to inflation.

After giving effect to the Be Acquisition and the acquisition by the Group of certain other companies
completed in 2022 (to the extent not already reflected in the Group’s results) as if they had occurred on
January 1, 2022, our largest customer and our top ten customers in the private sector accounted for 5.8%
and 27.5%, respectively, of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.

**Suppliers and Partners**

We have strong relationships with more than 50 major IT and software companies such as Amazon
Web Services, Google, Microsoft, RedHut, Dynatrace, Oracle, Salesforce, Tipco and Vmware. We rely
on many of these companies both for the supply of certain services and products necessary for the
operation of our business, such as hardware and certain software products and services (in which case,
we refer to them as suppliers), and for the provision of products and services that we manage, implement
and co-develop to our customers (in which case we refer to them as partners). The IT products and
technologies that we manage, implement and co-develop with our partners include, among others,
cybersecurity, cloud, AI and robotic process automation. For example, in 2022 we partnered with
Siemens Digital Technologies and Google Cloud to deliver a digital business platform and machine
learning applications both targeted at industrial customers. We also cooperate with these partners in
connection with the activities we conduct in relation to Digitech and System Integration. See “—Our
_Business—Activities.”_

Certain of our agreements for the supply of services and products including with our suppliers and
partners contain change of control provisions that, subject to certain conditions, may allow the
counterparty to terminate the contract.

We use products and services provided by our suppliers in the provision of our own products and
services as follows:

- **_Integration. Products and services provided by our suppliers are often complementary to our_**
own products and services, and we are able to integrate our own offerings with those of our
suppliers. For example, we integrate Salesforce relationship management services into our own
solutions.

- **_Incorporation. We enter into agreements for the supply of products and services that are_**
necessary for the operation of our products and services. For example, we license portions of
code that we then incorporate into our own software and we worked with Cisco to develop
Hycards, a platform for the management of membership cards, loyalty programs and for the
optimization of relationships with customers, updating our customers’ existing loyalty program
software.

- **_Resale. We enter into distribution agreements that allow us to sell products and services of our_**
suppliers to our customers. For example, we sell products and services provided by SAP,
Oracle, Red Hat and AWS.


-----

We benefit from long-lasting multi-year relationships with our suppliers and partners and, given our
nature of open partner ecosystem, we constantly continue to expand our partnership network.

**Research and Development**

Innovation has always been a key element for our competitiveness, long-term sustainability and success.
We continuously invest in R&D and innovation to support the ongoing improvement of our organization
in increasing our competitive capacity and fulfilling the needs of a fluid, rapidly changing market. We
believe that investing in R&D will help us continue to grow in the future.

We spent approximately €25 million in 2022 on R&D. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum,
we are involved in more than 100 research projects within the following key areas, spanning across all
our industry verticals: digital industry, smart transportation, digital and physical security, agrifood,
smart city, smart government, energy, waste management, 5G, digital media, cloud, big data,
blockchain and AI. Research projects are implemented in our six research labs located in Italy. Recently,
we have launched several key R&D initiatives, including among others a multi-year project together
with 30 different partners from multiple countries focusing on the creation of the first European energy
data space. Such space will offer an ecosystem enabling users to access data in a secure and
interoperable way, while aiming to facilitate a greater efficiency of energy systems and a green
transition.

Our R&D Lab department is composed of a dedicated team of over 500 professionals, which includes
researchers and data scientists. We employ all members of our R&D Lab and operate all of our internal
R&D activities in-house, while collaborating with our partners on larger research projects, particularly
those sponsored by government entities, such as projects funded by EU and national grants. Our
employees hold best-in-class certifications issued by our partners. Our R&D Lab, the core driver of our
product and service innovation process, works closely with the following other business units:

- Our _Innovators’ Network, comprises several innovation experts working among our market_
verticals and Group companies to analyze market trends and weaknesses and to translate them
in ideas for innovative solutions and products. Our R&D Lab transforms the Innovators’
Network’s ideas into prototypes using the most innovative technologies and methods.

- Our _Development Labs, comprising a dedicated group of professionals (including senior_
developers and solution architects), use research performed in other units for the development
of state-of-the art technologies that can be commercialized for the benefit of our customers.

- Our Products Labs, comprising a dedicated group of professionals (including subject matter
domain experts, business process analysts and solution architects), are devoted to designing,
developing and maintaining our proprietary solutions.

- Our Competence Centers, staffed by a team of consultants with deep experience in design
methodology, service design, project management tools and techniques, development
methodology, cybersecurity, field management solutions, managed content services, document
management, machine learning, data analysis, design thinking, and tools and security and work
to support the design and development processes of the Innovators Network, Development Labs
and Products Labs.

Our R&D Lab, together with our Innovators Network, Development Labs, Products Labs and
Competence Centers, incubate and prototype new concepts through applied R&D projects in order to
enrich our client offerings with innovative solutions and products.

Several of our research projects result in technologies that are used in our IT services, software and
digital platforms. The results of our research projects are transforming and improving our offerings to
our customers. For example, our Digital Enabler ecosystem platform, which provides a comprehensive
solution to facilitating a data-driven digital transformation of our customers’ organizations, is the


-----

outcome of several European research projects based on FIWARE principles and assets in which we
participated. In connection with the COVID-19 outbreak, our Digital Enabler assisted the accelerated
development of a digital tool aimed at both analyzing and monitoring the spread of COVID-19 on
several Italian regions.

We believe we are among the most active ICT research companies in Europe, attracting funds from
national and EU research programs, being ranked among the top 10 European private for profit
companies (and the first in Italy) in terms of EU funding under the European Union’s Horizon 2020
Programme for Research and Innovation. While, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, no
official documentation has been made available yet by the European Commission, we have been
awarded research funding under the new Horizon Europe 2021-2027 Programme for over 30 initiatives
and are finalizing the grant signature process for further ten initiatives. This confirms our ability to
submit high-quality research projects, and to maintain a strong position within the European research
landscape. In addition, we have been actively engaged in significant research and innovation initiatives
throughout Europe including, among others, GaiaX, the International Data Space Association,
FIWARE, the BigDataValue Association, AIOTI, ECSO and the Data Space Business Alliance.

Moreover, our focus on innovation is also evidenced by both being among the founding Italian partner
organizations, and one of the most active players in EIT Digital, an European Institute of Innovation
and Technology (“EIT”) Knowledge and Innovation Community (“KIC”) focused on strengthening
Europe’s position in the digital world by delivering digital innovations to the market and developing
entrepreneurial talent to globally impact economic growth and improved quality of life. In addition, in
2020 we have been selected among the recipients of the “Global MIKE (Most Innovative Knowledge
Enterprise) Award”, a renowned international recognition awarded to companies consistently
displaying best practices for innovation.

Moreover, to better serve our customers, our research activities enable us to form and maintain strong
connections with a broad network of industrial and scientific partnerships and global collaborations.
We maintain global research partnerships with more than 150 universities and have strategic alliances
with several research centers in Europe, the United States, Latin America and Asia, such as Imperial
College London, Keio University, Université Paris-Sud, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),
Politecnico di Milano, the Fraunhofer institutes and the Polytechnic University of Madrid.

We also deploy a significant amount of resources for the training of our technology engineers, core
process specialists and digital scientists who support our entire production cycle. Our internal “Enrico
Della Valle” IT & Management Academy, which is considered as one of the leading Italian corporate
schools for IT, provides an integrated logistics and residency system with a focus on management
master classes, technology upskills and personal skills, with an offer of over 500 different course
editions, resulting in over 32,000 training days per personnel in the year ended December 31, 2022. In
the year ended December 31, 2022, our IT & Management Academy trained more than 6,000 of our
employees and released more than 1,500 certifications. Our priority is to accelerate the injection of
talents into the base of our Group. For example, to strengthen our research capabilities, we recently
launched a plan for hiring skilled young talents over the next three years, in cooperation with the Italian
national research council (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - CNR) and other major Italian
universities.

We believe that our strong focus on R&D as well as the significant amount of resources deployed to
train our technology engineers, core process specialists and digital scientist, coupled with our strategic
acquisitions, will allow us to face the constantly increasing talent shortage in the IT industry,
representing the key challenge in the IT sector.

**Sales and Marketing**

We market our solutions and services to both existing and potential customers directly through our inhouse sales and business development teams. Our sales and marketing strategy targets markets by


-----

activity type to deliver key industry-specific and multi-industry service offerings to our customers. We
leverage our broad, multi-industry service offerings to develop packaged solutions tailored to achieve
a specific scope of work that we then offer to corporate customers, while maintaining a disciplined
approach to pricing and contracting. We also focus on developing prospective customer relationships
through market research and analysis, renewing expiring contracts and leveraging existing client
relationships to offer additional services. Our sales efforts typically involve extended selling cycles and
our expertise in specific industries is critical to secure new business opportunities. Our sales force
receives a fixed salary and an additional variable portion based on performance.

We have designated account managers for each of our strategic customer relationships. The account
manager is supported by our Competence Centers to ensure the best possible solution is provided to our
customers. Our sales force is primarily organized by industry vertical-specific teams that are supported
by activity-specific personnel. Significant new business opportunities are reviewed by business and
sales leaders from the applicable industry vertical, operations personnel, and members of our finance
department. If they determine that the new business is aligned with our strategic objectives and a good
use of our resources, then our business development team is authorized to pursue the opportunity. Our
sales and marketing teams coordinate to ensure the effective targeting of prospective customers. In
addition, customers of our Digitech solutions are assisted by a dedicated customer relationship team of
trained Digitech professionals, with the aim of providing on-going specialized support.

**Intellectual Property**

We provide value to our customers based in part on a differentiated range of proprietary inventions,
methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property. We recognize the
increasing value of intellectual property in the marketplace and create, harvest, and protect this
intellectual property. We leverage trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent laws, as well as
contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property. We own a number of patents, trademarks
and copyrights worldwide and have pending patent, trademark and copyright applications. We seek
patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services, or where
obtaining such proprietary rights is possible and will improve our competitive position. We do not hold
any patents that are material to our businesses. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we held
approximately 32 trademark registrations in Italy, European Union and United Kingdom, including,
_inter alia, the signs of Engineering, Engineering IT Works. Ellipse, AREAS, Ipsos, IQC Team, Innodo,_
Grace, infofattura, In4Mef, Qualipso, Bitglue, Movilitas, Trend, spagobi and DEUS TECHNOLOGY.
In addition, Be held two trademark’s registrations in Italy and the European Union for “TOGETher”,
related to educational, social and charity initiatives and activities, and “BE SHAPING THE FUTURE
OF FINANCIAL SERVICES” related to the core business of Be.

Our business relies on software. With respect to proprietary software, we claim copyright on all such
software, registering works which may be accessible to third parties. In addition, we rely on maintaining
source code confidentiality to ensure our market competitiveness. We also use third party intellectual
property. We have acquired all material licenses for such software and any other third party intellectual
property. We comply with the terms and conditions of these licenses and have not faced any material
claims in relation to the breach of any third party copyrights.

**Quality Assurance**

We believe that providing a consistent high-quality service is critical in our customers’ decision to retain
our services and for us to build long-term relationships with them. Our quality control framework is
based on the certification of our operations and processes, regular process audits by our internal
compliance team and independent external quality assurance providers. Our operations and processes
are certified, inter alia, to the following internationally recognized standards:

- ISO 45001:2018: this standard regulates the adoption of a safety management system, aimed at

managed service, server farm, storage, backup and cloud services, among others.

- AQAP 2110/AQAP 2210: this standard developed by NATO establishes standards for the
design, development and maintenance of IT systems suitable for military use.

In addition, on December 2022 we became a certified entity by Teledife, the general directorate of
telecommunications, IT and advanced technologies of the Italian Ministry of Defence.

We are routinely subject to audits by our customers in regard to our compliance with the
abovementioned standards. Certain of our contracts, such as for example our contracts with certain
military customers, include provisions that allow such customers to terminate their contracts with us in
case we fail to maintain our compliance with the abovementioned standards. We also publish a
Corporate Social Responsibility Report on a yearly basis, which is available on our website. In addition,
since 2021 we provide a yearly progress update towards the implementation of the UN global compact
principles.

**Regulation**

In providing services and solutions to customers, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or
confidential customer or company data, including personal data, and therefore we must comply with
strict data protection and privacy laws, such as the GDPR, in all the jurisdictions in which we operate.
In addition, participation in public tenders subjects us to further regulation under the Italian Code of
Public Contracts (the “ICPP”), currently set forth in Legislative Decree No. 36 of March 31, 2023. The
ICPP replaced the previous code of public contracts set forth by Legislative Decree No. 50 of April 8,
2001, which, however, continues to regulate all the tender procedures based on calls for bids published
before April 1, 2023. The provisions of the ICPP are mainly aimed at ensuring that public contracting
authorities/entities apply the best criteria to select contractors in terms of costs and quality of the
relevant offers in compliance with the EU principles of efficiency, free competition, non-discrimination,
transparency and proportionality.


-----

According to the ICPP, participation in public tenders requires us to meet three main sets of
requirements, namely (i) general morality requirements, (ii) economic and financial capacity and (iii)
technical and professional skills. Requirements (ii) and (iii) are identified by the awarding entities on a
case-by-case basis since they relate and proportionate to the subject matter of the public tender;
requirement (i) has a general scope and aims at excluding from the tenders, amongst others: (a) subjects
or entities that have been convicted of certain types of crimes with a non-appealable judgment
(including, participation in criminal organizations, corruption, bribery, fraud, terrorism and mafiarelated crimes), (b) entities facing bankruptcy or involved in proceedings for the declaration of
bankruptcy, (c) entities which failed to pay social security contributions or taxes, (d) subjects or entities
found guilty of material professional misconduct which renders their integrity or reliability
questionable, (e) entities which rendered misrepresentations, (f) entities subject to the sanctions
disqualifying them from exercising certain activities as provided by LD 231/2001.

Through our acquisition of Cybertech, a company specialized in offering cybersecurity solutions, we
significantly increased our cybersecurity capabilities and enhanced our internal data protection and
security framework, with the aim of deploying an infrastructure able to address vulnerabilities and
providing our customers with advanced security services.

We constantly monitor the evolution of cyber threats and routinely investigate potential system
vulnerabilities through our cyber intelligence capabilities. We have also created a dedicated corporate
security department, which is entrusted with the monitoring of our cybersecurity control system, and
the review of our cyber infrastructure and integrated organizational model. For example, we maintain
the ability to successfully thwart cyberattack attempts (including phishing attacks) by leveraging on our
security operation center (which operates on a 24/7 basis) on a 24x7 Security Operation Center and our
incident management team.

**Properties**

Our headquarters are located in Rome. Including our headquarters in Rome, we operate approximately
60 offices in countries including Italy, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Switzerland,
the United States, Mexico, Brazil and Serbia. As a result of the successful completion of the Be
Acquisition, we also operate from Be’s offices in various new countries, including in Central and
Eastern Europe, such as Albania, Poland and Romania, while also strengthening our presence in the
DACH region (i.e., Germany, Austria and Switzerland). We lease the majority of our facilities
(including our new flagship office in Milan (Italy)), and we own a real estate complex in Orvieto (Terni),
a real estate asset in Padova and the premises of our “Enrico Della Valle” IT & Management Academy
in Ferentino (Rome).

**Data Centers, Development Labs and Delivery Centers**

We operate three state-of-the-art data centers located in Vicenza, Turin and Pont-Saint-Martin, which
are designed to provide the highest levels of availability and resilience needed for mission-critical IT
products and services. Our data centers manage more than 20 million gigabytes per year and host more
than 21,000 servers. We own the premises of our Turin data center and lease the premises of our PontSaint-Martin and Vicenza data centers, while owning the equipment through which all our data centers
are managed. We rent seven development laboratories in Rome, Naples, Padua, Palermo, Turin,
Belgrade and Siena, where we develop our software

**Environment**

We are committed to respecting the environment also through the reduction of the impact of our
business activities on the environment. We have implemented processes to this effect and systematically
evaluate the environmental impact of our activities. We have established contingency plans for the
management of emergencies with potentially hazardous outcomes for the environment and through an
evaluation of the environmental consequences of our new products and services. Although we consider
our activities to have a low pollution risk, we have implemented an ISO 14001:2015-certified


-----

environmental management system, a certification which also covers our Rome, Pont-Saint-Martin,
Vicenza, Naples and Palermo sites and our subsidiaries operating at those sites (i.e., the Company,
Municipia, EDH, Nexen and Webresults). This management system, along with our annual ESG
reporting, allows us to systematically evaluate the environmental impact of our activities, monitor
performance and improve processes linked to the relevant environmental factors (electricity
consumption, fuel and electronic waste and risks related to land spills) with respect to our three data
centers in Vicenza, Turin, and Pont-Saint-Martin, our offices in Italy, and our car fleet. We also comply
with applicable legislation with respect to the control of emissions into the atmosphere, soil and water,
and have monitored the carbon footprint of our Italian operations since 2019, in accordance with the
Green House Gas Protocol (GHG) GHG-Green House Gas Protocol. In addition, we implemented a
ISO 14064-1:2018 certified greenhouse gas emissions quantification and reporting system. Such
certification recognizes our adoption of a technological framework to quantify, monitor and ultimately
reduce CO2 emissions, while improving the overall efficiency and environmental impact of our business
activities.

In 2021, we recorded an 8% decrease in Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while electricity usage by our data
centers also decreased by 14%. In addition, 65% of the electricity consumed at our Italian offices and
data centers is sourced from renewable sources. We also implemented an energy efficiency project at
our Pont-Saint-Martin data center, which has driven the improvement of the local power usage
effectiveness score (PUE) from 1.52 to 1.51. We deploy resources that we consider sufficient for the
implementation of our environmental policies and objectives. We maintain a high level of sustainability
by guaranteeing that the majority of the electronic waste produced by the data centers is reused in other
industrial sectors. To optimize the management of electronic waste, we have implemented a sustainable
system in the Italian offices that enable us to limit the costs of purchasing new PCs and has a more
limited impact on the environment, with a lower average standard production of electronic waste related
to PC replacement. For several years, the Group’s Technological Infrastructure Services (“SIT”) office
has developed a strong and efficient system for the restoration of damaged computers through the
replacement of damaged or obsolete components, which contributes to a more sustainable use of
available resources and, at the same time, reduces our operational costs.

We also comply with applicable regulations concerning the responsible use of energy and the
sustainable use of transportation, including Law No. 10 of January 9, 1991, the Decree of the Ministry
of the Environment of March 27, 1998 and Legislative Decree No. 152 of April 3, 2006, and we have
identified the competent energy manager. In order to limit our carbon foot print and greenhouse gas
emissions, we have adopted a business travel policy that places special emphasis on fuel consumption
and emission limits also to reduce the average fuel consumption threshold, thereby ensuring a decline
in CO2 and other polluting emissions caused by our employees.

Our Group offices are all plastic-free and our offices in Rome and Milan are LEED certified.

Over recent years, we have intensified our commitment to sustainability and expanded initiatives for
reporting to our stakeholders on social responsibility. In particular, we strongly support the three ESG
parameters, as enshrined in the sustainability goals of the UN Agenda 2030, which aims to ensure a
sustainable future for people, business and society by the targeting innovative digital solutions in the
fields of energy and mobility transition, sustainable consumption, energy and resource-saving
production, and transparent supply chains. In addition, in 2021 we became a signatory under the UN
global compact. By adhering to the UN global compact, we committed to making the UN global
compact and its principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption and
integral part of our strategy, culture and day-to-day operations. To this end, we also committed to report
on a yearly basis on our progress towards the implementation of these principles as well as on the
performance of our CSR framework, the first such report being provided in 2021. As a further testament
to our commitment to the Group’s sustainability policies and their compliance with the global reporting
initiative (GRI) standards, in December 2022, we published our 2021 Sustainability Report, which for
the first time, was verified by Deloitte as a third-party reviewer. Moreover, in 2022 we received the
following third-party recognitions for our environmental performance: CDP-Climate Change (with a


-----

score of: C=Awareness), EcoVadis (with an environment score of: 70/100) and Open-es (with a plant
score of: 70/100)

We are also maintaining a strong focus on protecting customer data, being certified pursuant to ISO
27001:2017, and we implemented appropriate security management standards which are routinely
monitored. In addition, we have been recently recognized as a leading company within the cybersecurity
sector in terms of promoting sustainability and received a special mention at the Biblioteca Bilancio
Sociale awards from 2018 to 2021. Moreover, within our Public Administration industry vertical, we
offer sustainable city ecosystem platforms through which we advise city administrators on creating new
smart services or improving existing smart services for various municipal services such as public
transportation and waste management. Our sustainable city solutions allow us to embed innovative
technologies into municipal services in a sustainable and transparent way and enable companies and
society to focus on their own efficiency and sustainability outcomes.

**Employees**

The following table sets forth the average number of our employees expressed in FTE by function for
the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively:

**Year ended December 31,**

**2020** **2021** **2022****

Executives .............................................................................................. 392 394 485

Managers. .............................................................................................. 2,034 2,108 2,278

Other employees ..................................................................................... 9,206 9,069 9,711

**Total* .....................................................................................................** **11,632** **11,571** **12,474**

_____________

- Employee figures are FTE figures (excluding temporary workers). Employee figures are based on the average number of
employees for the period.

** 2022 employees include the employees of the Be Group.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we hired 1,046 new employees and recruited 550 apprentices
as part of our Group apprenticeship program, with approximately 96% of such relationships having
being converted into a permanent employment contract upon expiration over the same period. Our
relationship with the majority of our employees in Italy is subject to collective bargaining agreements.
In general, the collective bargaining agreements include terms that regulate remuneration, minimum
salary, salary complements, extra time, benefits, bonuses and partial disability. Our employees in Italy
are subject to various collective bargaining agreements (“CCNL”) including, among the others, CCNL
for employees in the mechanical engineering sector, CCNL for employees in the trade companies sector,
CCNL for employees in the telecommunications sector and CCNL for executives in the industrial
sector.

Trade unions and work councils are active at all our premises and as of December 31, 2022, 10.5% of
our employees were unionized. We have entered into a company-wide collective agreement with trade
unions active in our company regulating annual performance bonuses and employee social security. We
have also entered into a further company-wide collective agreement regulating remuneration and health
insurance of executives. We consider our relations with employees, trade unions, and work councils to
be good and we have not experienced any significant labor issues in the past three years.

We are required by Italian law to employ employees considered by law to be disabled in a percentage
constituting at least 7% of our workforce. We are also required by Italian law to employ employees
considered by law to be disadvantaged in a percentage constituting at least 1% of our workforce. As of
December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with these legal requirements.


-----

Following completion of the Be Acquisition and the consolidation of the Be Group into our business,
we have added approximately 1,934 new employees to our Group.

**Pensions**

Italian law provides that, upon termination of employment, Italian employees are entitled to severance
pay (trattamento di fine rapporto) based on their annual salary, the duration of their employment and
the rate of inflation. We have in place both defined-contribution and defined-benefit pension plans. We
make pension contributions on behalf of our employees as required by applicable Italian law. Other
than increases in contributions required by law, we do not expect significant pension liabilities going
forward.

**Insurance**

As an integral part of our risk management program, we maintain insurance coverage for property
damage, data breaches, business interruptions, directors’ and officers’ liability and product liability.
Insurance cover for these risks is provided through a combination of self-insured deductibles and annual
aggregates. Our insurance coverage is reviewed on an annual basis. We believe the levels of risks
insured, risks retained and the limits of insurance indemnity are broadly in line with similar companies
in the same industry sector, but we cannot guarantee that we could not be adversely affected by damage
or accidents despite possessing said insurance coverage. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our
_Business and Industry—Our insurance coverage might not be sufficient and we might be subject to_
_uninsured losses.”_

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time we become involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course
of business, such as disputes with our customers and suppliers, authorities or business partners, labor
law disputes and disputes relating to intellectual property. These disputes can entail amounts that are
material for the operation of our business.

As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, we are involved, through our subsidiary, SISEV, in two
disputes against Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. (“Sicilia Digitale”) and Regione Siciliana for unpaid amounts of
€131.1 million in nominal value for both proceedings. In particular, in 2016, in the context of a claim
to obtain payment of approximately €80 million of unpaid invoices, Regione Siciliana and Sicilia
Digitale filed a counterclaim against us alleging a breach of contract and claiming damages for an
amount of €96 million. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum this litigation is still ongoing.
Following an order by the competent court, we settled a previous litigation against Sicilia Digitale for
unpaid invoices in an amount of approximately €20 million (of which €13 million were awarded to us
and the remainder to a co-contractor) as compared to an original amount claimed of approximately €30
million. Two appeals are currently pending with respect to such proceedings and the next hearings are
scheduled on June 9, 2023 and January 12, 2024. We have set-up an allowance for doubtful accounts
in relation to such proceedings, which, as of December 31, 2022 was equal to €27.8 (including a fund
for late interest equal to €53.3).

Other than what disclosed herein, we are currently not involved in any legal proceedings which, either
individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on our reputation,
financial position or results of operations. We note, however, that the outcome of legal proceedings can
be extremely difficult to predict, and we offer no assurances in this regard.

18 years of industry experience, across 39 cities and 26 countries globally.

**_Existing Shareholder Agreement_**

On February 5, 2020 the direct shareholders and certain indirect shareholders of TopCo entered into a
co-investment and shareholder agreement (the “Existing Shareholder Agreement”) governing the
mechanics for the funding of the Engineering Acquisition as well as their rights with respect to
management and corporate governance of the Group and the future divestment therefrom. On March
25, 2020, Centurion Topco S.à r.l., Centurion Midco S.à r.l., Centurion Holdco and TopCo and the
Issuer adhered to the Existing Shareholder Agreement.

The Existing Shareholder Agreement provides for certain governance rights to be exercised, directly or
indirectly (as the case may be), by the Sponsors. Voting rights (e.g. for the appointment of the corporate
bodies) are equally distributed among the Sponsors; nevertheless, should the equity contributed by one
of the Sponsors be lower than certain thresholds, the relevant voting rights will be automatically reduced
accordingly. Also veto rights in the shareholders’ meetings and board of directors’ resolutions are
granted based on the equity contributed by each of the Sponsors. Conversely, economic rights are held
proportionally with the corporate capital respectively held, directly or indirectly, in the vehicles.
Specific provisions govern the designation and appointment of the Chairman, CEO and CFO of the
Company.

With reference to Centurion Topco S.à r.l., the Sponsors are granted with a customary right of first
offer, tag-along and drag along rights and a four-year lock-up undertaking is also provided for under
the Shareholder Agreement. Please note that rules on transfer are based on the equity contributed in
Centurion Holdco S.à r.l. by the Sponsors in the same manner as the governance rights.

According to the Existing Shareholder Agreement, certain members of our senior management and
future managers participate to a management co-investment plan that was implemented following
completion of the Engineering Acquisition. The Existing Shareholder Agreement contains other
customary provisions regarding confidentiality, compliance undertakings, information rights and
cooperation See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions— Existing Management Co_Investment Plan.”_

**_Be Reinvestment and Shareholders Agreement_**

On June 19, 2022, the Company, the Issuer, TopCo, Centurion HoldCo and certain other direct and
indirect holding companies controlled by our Sponsors, entered into the Be Reinvestment and


-----

Shareholders Agreement with the Sellers, pursuant to which the Sellers and certain key managers of Be
and other investors agreed to invest, through Roll-Over Holdco, an aggregate amount of up to €67.1
million (€53.8 million of which to be provided by the Sellers using a portion of the proceeds received
from the sale of the Initial Be Shares) in the share capital of TopCo, by way of a severable reserved
capital increase to be subscribed in one or more tranches by Roll-Over Holdco, as described in more
details under “Summary—The Transactions—The Sellers’ Reinvestment.”

The Be Reinvestment and Shareholders Agreement also sets forth certain provisions relating to, among
others, (i) certain corporate governance rules applicable to Be and its subsidiaries and (ii) certain rules
concerning the transfer of TopCo’s shares and the potential divestment of the current direct and indirect
shareholders of the Company. See also “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure” and “Principal
_Shareholders.”_

## CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

**General**

In the course of our ordinary business activities, we have entered into certain related party transactions
with our shareholders, key management and affiliated companies and persons. We believe that all such
transactions have been negotiated and conducted on an arm’s-length basis and that the terms of these
transactions are comparable to those currently contracted with unrelated third parties. For an overview
of the material transactions between the Group and its related parties please refer to the notes to the
2022 Audited Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In addition,
from time to time, we and/or the Sponsors may buy any of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the
Existing Notes, on the open market or otherwise.

Other current liabilities as at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 include post-employment benefit
payables to some of our senior managers under a stability pact signed in 2009.

In 2020, the Issuer, as borrower, and TopCo, as lender, entered into a proceeds loan agreement maturing
in 2027, whereby TopCo on-lent the Existing PIK Notes proceeds to the Issuer, in the context of the
Engineering Acquisition.

Some of the Company’s key executive management members including the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer, have entered into a non-compete agreement with the Company and
certain of its subsidiaries, for which they have been compensated.

Certain directors of the Issuer hold a carried interest in the funds managed by the Sponsors that
indirectly own the shares of the Issuer.

**Management Co-Investment Plan**

Following completion of the Engineering Acquisition and pursuant to the Existing Shareholder
Agreement, the Sponsors have established a management equity co-investment plan, pursuant to which
members of the Group’s senior management team (including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer) subscribed to a portion of the share capital of Centurion Midco S.à r.l., an indirect
parent company of the Issuer. In connection with their investment, the subscribing managers have
entered into certain customary documentation with customary terms and conditions. In addition,
Centurion Midco S.à r.l. granted a loan for approximately €0.1 million to the Chief Financial Officer in
connection with the implementation of the management equity co-investment plan, a portion of which
remains outstanding and is expected to be fully repaid in May 2024. As of December 31, 2022, 0.4%
of the share capital of Centurion Midco S.à r.l. is held by these members of the Company’s senior
management team. See “Principal Shareholders.”

## DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

_The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements in addition_
_to the Indenture after giving effect to the Transactions. The following summaries do not purport to_
_describe all of the applicable terms and conditions of such arrangements and are qualified in their_
_entirety by reference to the actual agreements. Capitalized terms used in the following summaries and_
_not otherwise defined in this Offering Memorandum have the meanings ascribed to them in their_
_respective agreements._

**Existing Notes**

On October 8, 2020, the Issuer issued €605.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% senior
secured notes due 2026 (the “Existing Notes”) at a price of 98.766% under an indenture dated October
8, 2020, among, inter alios, the Issuer and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee and security agent,
as supplemented by virtue of the first supplemental indenture dated as of April 7, 2022 (the “Existing
Notes Indenture”), the gross proceeds of which were used, together with cash on hand at the Issuer and
term loans provided under the Existing Term Loan, to repay in full indebtedness incurred to finance the
Engineering Acquisition.

**_Ranking_**

The Existing Notes are general, senior obligations of the Issuer and, subsequent to the Engineering
Merger, MergerCo; are secured by the Collateral (as defined in the Existing Indenture) on a first-priority
basis (subject to certain exceptions) along with obligations under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility,
certain hedging obligations (if any) and the Existing Term Loan; rank pari passu in right of payment to
any existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer that is not expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Existing Notes, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain hedging obligations related thereto (if any) and the
Existing Term Loan; rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the
Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Existing Notes; rank effectively senior
to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not secured by the Collateral (as defined in
the Existing Indenture) to the extent of the value of the Collateral; are effectively subordinated to any
existing and future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer or of subsidiaries of the Issuer that are
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Existing Notes, or that secures such other
indebtedness on a super senior basis (including obligations under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and certain hedging obligations related thereto (if any)), to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such other indebtedness or obligation; structurally subordinated to any
existing or future indebtedness or obligations of the existing and future subsidiaries of the Issuer (or
MergerCo, as applicable) that are not guarantors of the Existing Notes, including obligations owed to
trade creditors.

**_Interest Rates, Payment Dates and Maturity_**

The Existing Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.875% per annum. Interest on the Existing Notes is
payable semi-annually in arrears on March 31 and September 30 of each year. The first interest payment
date was March 31, 2021. The Existing Notes will mature on September 30, 2026.

**_Guarantees_**

The Existing Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by the Company, subject to certain material
limitations pursuant to applicable law. None of (i) the subsidiaries of the Company and (ii) Be and any
of its subsidiaries is expected to guarantee the Existing Notes. The Company’s guarantee of the Existing
Notes is a senior obligation of the Company and ranks pari passu in right of payment with any existing
and future indebtedness of the Company that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to its
guarantee of the Existing Notes (including the Company’s guarantee of the Notes), the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations related thereto (if any), the Existing Term Loan;


-----

ranks senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is expressly
subordinated to the guarantee; is effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or
obligation of the Company that is secured by property and assets that do not secure its guarantee of the
Existing Notes, or which secures such other indebtedness on a super senior basis (including obligations
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations, if any), to the extent of
the value of the property and assets securing such other indebtedness or obligation; and is structurally
subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries.

**_Security_**

The Existing Notes and the related guarantees are secured by the Collateral (as defined in the Existing
Indenture) and the Initial Collateral, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Collateral (as defined
in the Existing Indenture) and the Initial Collateral also secure the obligations under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations (if any), and the Existing Term Loan and will
secure the obligations under the Notes, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Optional Redemption_**

Other than as set forth in the Existing Indenture, the Existing Notes were not redeemable until
September 30, 2022. Starting on September 30, 2022 the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time,
a part of the Existing Notes, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount)
set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and certain additional amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve month period beginning on
September 30 of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**

2022......................................................................................................................... 102.938%

2023......................................................................................................................... 101.469%

2024 and thereafter ................................................................................................ 100.000%

**_Covenants_**

The terms of the Existing Notes are substantially similar to the terms of the Notes offered hereby. See
“Summary—The Offering” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**_Change of Control_**

Following the occurrence of certain change of control events, each holder of Existing Notes will have
the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of that holder’s Existing Notes at a purchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes repurchased, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and certain additional amounts, if any, on the Existing Notes repurchased
to the date of the purchase, unless such Existing Notes are redeemed.

In connection with any tender offer for the Existing Notes, if holders of Existing Notes of not less than
90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Existing Notes validly tender and do
not withdraw such Existing Notes in such tender offer, the Issuer will have the right to redeem the
Existing Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price
equal to the price (excluding any early tender fee) offered to each other holder of Existing Notes in such
tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption.

In addition, in the event that the Issuer or any guarantor of the Existing Notes becomes obligated to t
pay additional amounts (as defined in the Existing Indenture) to holders of the Existing Notes as a result
of certain changes affecting taxes applicable to payments on the Existing Notes, it may redeem the


-----

Existing Notes in whole but not in part at any time at 100% of the principal amount of the Existing
Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to such redemption date.

**_Events of default_**

The Existing Indenture contains customary events of default including, among others, the non-payment
of principal or interest on the Existing Notes, certain failures to perform or observe any other obligation
under the Existing Indenture or the related security documents, as applicable, the failure to pay certain
principal amounts of indebtedness when due or judgments and the bankruptcy or insolvency of the
Company, the Issuer, or any Restricted Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (each term, as defined in the Existing Indenture).
The occurrence of any events of default would permit or result in the acceleration of all obligations
outstanding under the Existing Notes.

**Existing Term Loan Agreement**

On October 8, 2020, the Issuer, as borrower, entered into a senior secured facility agreement with, inter
_alios, Banco BPM S.p.A. as mandated lead arranger and original lender and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited_
as security agent (the “Existing Term Loan Agreement”). The outstanding amount under the Existing
Term Loan Agreement (the “Existing Term Loan”) is €38.4 million and the gross proceeds from the
Existing Term Loan were used in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness incurred for
the financing of the Engineering Acquisition. The Existing Term Loan bears interest at a rate per annum
equal to EURIBOR (subject to a zero floor) plus a margin of 5 per cent per annum. Default interest is
calculated as an additional 1% per annum on the defaulted amount.

The Existing Term Loan will mature on the earlier to occur of (a) January 22, 2027 and (b) the final
maturity date of the Existing Notes.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Existing Term Loan Agreement, which
follows terms substantially similar to the Existing Notes), each lender will be entitled to require
prepayment of outstanding amounts and cancellation of its commitments within a prescribed time
period.

The Existing Term Loan is guaranteed by the Issuer and the Company. The Existing Term Loan is
secured by liens on the Collateral, which liens rank _pari passu with the liens securing the Existing_
Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes and the Notes offered hereby. Pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties to
certain hedging obligations will, in each case, contractually be entitled to receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the lender under the Existing Term Loan and the Existing
Notes.

The Existing Term Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties (made on the
date of the Existing Term Loan Agreement and the closing date thereunder and subject to certain agreed
qualifications), including: (i) status, (ii) binding obligations, (iii) non-conflict with other obligations,
(iv) power and authority, (v) validity and admissibility in evidence, (vi) insolvency, (vi) no default, (vii)
taxation, (viii) no proceedings pending or threatened, (ix) liens/guarantees/indebtedness, (x) ranking,
(xi) good title to assets, (xii) COMI, (xiii) financial statements and (xiv) anti-corruption and sanctions.

The Existing Term Loan Agreement provides for substantially the same covenants of the Existing
Notes. In addition, the Existing Term Loan Agreement also requires the Issuer and certain of its
restricted subsidiaries to observe certain other customary positive and negative covenants, subject to
certain exceptions and grace periods, including covenants relating to: (i) anti-corruption law and
sanctions; (ii) further assurance; and (iii) note purchases (whereby, subject to certain exceptions, if the
Issuer redeems any of the Existing Notes it must at the same time also repay a pro rata amount of the
Existing Term Loan). The Existing Term Loan Agreement also requires, subject to certain conditions,


-----

the Issuer to comply with certain customary information undertakings, including delivery of quarterly
and annual financial statements and delivery of KYC information.

The Existing Term Loan Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as the Existing
Notes. In addition, the Existing Term Loan Agreement provides for additional events of default
including, subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, (i) misrepresentation; (ii)
invalidity and unlawfulness of the Existing Term Loan financing documents; (iii) failure to comply with
the Intercreditor Agreement; and (iv) repudiation and recession of agreements.

The Existing Term Loan Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection
with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and enforced in accordance with English law
although the restrictive covenants, events of default and related definitions scheduled to the Existing
Term Loan Agreement are to be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the
fact that the Existing Term Loan Agreement is governed by English law).

**Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the Engineering Acquisition, on July 10, 2020, the Issuer has entered into a super
senior revolving credit facility agreement with, among others, BNP Paribas, Italian Branch, as the agent
(the “SSRCF Agent”), and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as the security agent (the “Existing Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement”). The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for a super
senior revolving credit facility in a principal amount of €160.0 million. On or about September 19,
2022, certain lenders made available an additional facility under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of €35.0 million by way of a fungible increase of the total
commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility to €195.0 million. See “Summary—The
_Transactions—The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”_

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by the Issuer and certain of its restricted
subsidiaries which accede to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as additional borrowers
of that facility (the “SSRCF Borrowers”) and may be applied in or towards (directly or indirectly) (x)
financing or refinancing the working capital requirements and/or the general corporate purposes of the
Group and (x) any other purpose contemplated by the funds flow statement or the tax structure
memorandum in connection with the Engineering Acquisition.

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility is available in euros and certain other currencies readily
available in the relevant interbank market by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of letters of credit
and ancillary facilities (on a bilateral and fronted basis).

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes (in addition to other permissions under the
limitation on indebtedness covenant) the ability (without double counting against the limitation on
indebtedness covenant) to incur additional indebtedness (including under one or more uncommitted
additional facilities within the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or any additional
notes and/or other facilities or notes documented outside the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) up to an aggregate amount of the greater of €183.00 million and 100% of Consolidated
EBITDA (as defined in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and subject to certain
customary additions including the amount of prepayments and buy-backs).

**_Availability_**

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from (and including) the date of the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to (and including) the date which is one (1) month prior to the
maturity date of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, being July 23, 2026.


-----

**_Conditions Precedent_**

Utilizations of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility are subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal
to EURIBOR, plus an applicable margin, which in each case will be subject to a decreasing margin
ratchet based on the ratio of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Debt as at the last day of the relevant
period to Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA in respect of that relevant period (each as defined in the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (the “Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio”).

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility from the Closing Date (as defined in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the “Closing Date”) to the end of the availability period applicable to the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of thirty (30)% of the applicable margin for the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility. Commitment fees will be payable quarterly in arrears and on the date the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on which the relevant lender cancels its
commitment.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount (subject to any
customary Italian usury law exceptions).

**_Repayments_**

The loans made under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the last day of the interest
period relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings. All outstanding amounts under
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the date falling sixty-nine months from the
Closing Date. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility may be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions.

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to de
minimis amounts). The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also permits each lender to
require the mandatory prepayment of all amounts due to that lender upon a “Change of Control.”

A “Change of Control” for the purposes of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility is defined as per the
Existing Notes.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility was initially guaranteed by the Issuer, and was subsequently
guaranteed by the Company on May 9, 2022.

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility is secured by the Collateral and, following completion of the
Engineering Merger, will be secured by the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral that also secures the
Notes as set forth under “Description of the Notes—Security.” The Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement provides that material subsidiaries (wholly owned members of the Group representing more
than five (5) per cent. of Consolidated EBITDA) will guarantee the Facilities and, subject to the terms
of the Agreed Security Principles set out therein, provide security over (x) shares owned by such
Material Subsidiaries in other Material Subsidiaries and (y) any receivables owed to that Material
Subsidiary by any Obligor. Subject to certain adjustments and the agreed security principles that apply
to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Issuer is required to ensure that members of
the Group that (x) are material subsidiaries and/or (y) collectively contribute in aggregate at least eighty


-----

(80) per cent. of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) are guarantors of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (i) on the earlier of the
date which is (x) one hundred and twenty (120) days after (and excluding) the Engineering Merger Date
and (y) one hundred and twenty (120) days after (and excluding) the date falling twelve (12) Months
after April 8, 2022, and (ii) thereafter within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the date when the
annual financial statements of the Issuer are required to be delivered to the agent in connection with the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to
certain limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and
the other matters set forth in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (and, to the extent such
requirement is not satisfied on such date, the Issuer shall ensure that it is so satisfied within 120 days of
such date).

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain representations and warranties
(subject to certain agreed qualifications and with certain representations being repeated), including,
among others, (i) status, binding obligations, non-conflict with other obligations, power and authority,
validity and admissibility in evidence and _pari passu ranking, (ii) no insolvency, taxation and no_
litigation, (iii) no default, financial statements, base case model and reports (iv) no
liens/guarantees/indebtedness, (v) good title to assets, (vi) intellectual property, (vii) acquisition
documents and (viii) centre of main interests and compliance with sanctions and anti-corruption laws.

Certain representations and warranties will be made on the Closing Date and will be repeated on the
date of each utilization, on the first day of each interest period (other than in the case of roll over cash
drawings) and at certain other times.

**_Covenants_**

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and
related definitions (with certain adjustments and exceptions) that are set forth in the Existing Indenture.

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a “note purchase condition” covenant.
Subject to certain exceptions set out in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Issuer
may not, and the Issuer shall procure that no restricted subsidiary will, repay, prepay, purchase, defease
or redeem (or otherwise retire for value) any Notes prior to their scheduled repayment date. The
exceptions to such covenant include (among other things) note purchases that do not exceed 50% of the
aggregate of (i) the original aggregate principal face value amount of the Notes and (ii) the aggregate
principal amount of outstanding Notes as at the Closing Date or (without double counting) when initially
incurred at any time after the Closing Date (the “Notes Purchase Basket”) or to the extent the aggregate
principal face value amount of all note purchases exceeds the Notes Purchase Basket an amount of the
commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility are cancelled or prepaid in the same
proportion by which the Notes in excess of the Notes Purchase Basket are prepaid, purchased, defeased
or redeemed (or otherwise retired for value), until the commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility are reduced to €80,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency or currencies).

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires the Issuer and certain of its restricted
subsidiaries to observe certain other customary positive and negative covenants, subject to certain
exceptions and grace periods, including covenants relating to (i) authorizations, (ii) compliance with
laws; (iii) centre of main interests; (iv) provision of guarantees and security (v) compliance with
sanctions, anti-money laundering and anti- corruption laws, (vi) further assurance and (vii) conditions
subsequent.


-----

In addition, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes a financial covenant requiring
the drawn super senior leverage ratio not to exceed a flat ratio to be set with 40 per cent. headroom
versus the base case model for the Existing Revolving Credit Facility (which shall be calculated by
reducing Consolidated EBITDA as set out in that base case model (the “Drawn Super Senior Leverage
Ratio”)). The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio is calculated as the ratio of consolidated drawn loans
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, less the aggregate amount of cash, cash equivalents and
temporary cash investments held by the Group (the “Drawn Super Senior Facilities Debt”) to
consolidated pro forma EBITDA for the twelve month period preceding the relevant quarterly testing
date and is tested quarterly on a rolling basis, subject to the aggregate outstanding principal base
currency amount of all loans drawn under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any
utilizations by way of letters of credit (or bank guarantees), ancillary facilities, any loans drawn on the
Closing Date, any loans drawn to fund any original issue discount, other flex related payments or other
fees, costs and expenses and, in each case, any Rollover Loans in respect of any such exclusions), less
any cash, cash equivalents and temporary cash investments held by the Group exceeding 40% of the
total commitments in respect of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility (or, if higher, the total
commitments in respect of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility as at the date of the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) on the relevant test date. The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio
only acts as a draw stop to new drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and, if breached,
will not trigger a default or an event of default under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio is based on the definitions and adjustments in the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the Existing
Indenture and the equivalent definitions described in this Offering Memorandum.

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the
shareholders of the Issuer to make shareholder injections by way of debt and/or equity to the Issuer to
be (i) added to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (an “EBITDA Cure”), (ii) taken into account when
calculating Drawn Super Senior Facilities Debt or (iii) taken into account when calculating if the Test
Condition (as defined in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) has been met.

The EBITDA Cure right may not be exercised on more than five occasions during the term of the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility and may not be exercised more than twice in any four (4) consecutive
financial quarters.

If the financial covenant has been breached but is complied with on the next test date or other relevant
period prior to the next test date (the “Second Test Date”) or the Test Condition (as defined in the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) is not satisfied on the Second Test Date, then any prior
draw stop event arising as a result shall be automatically deemed cured.

**_Events of Default_**

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default
as under the Notes. In addition, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for
additional events of default, subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including
(i) inaccuracy of a representation or statement when made, (ii) unlawfulness and invalidity of the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility financing documents (including the applicable security documents),
(iii) material failure to comply with the Intercreditor Agreement and (iv) repudiation or rescission of
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility financing documents (including the applicable security
documents).

**_Governing Law_**

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of
or in connection with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in
accordance with English law although the information undertakings, restrictive covenants, events of


-----

default and related definitions scheduled to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be
interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, on July 21,
2020, the Issuer entered into an Intercreditor Agreement between, among others, the agent, arrangers
and lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the trustee under the Existing
Notes Indenture and the Security Agent.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the
relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Issuer and
any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or Third Party Security
Provider, when payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors or Third Party Security
Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to which
certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover
provisions and provisions related to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement.
It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document
because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes and of
the Trustee. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the
Intercreditor Agreement.

For the purposes of this description:

“Senior Secured Group” shall mean the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

References to the “Senior Secured Notes” shall include the Notes and any other notes, securities or
other debt instruments issued or to be issued by a member of the Senior Secured Group which are
designated by the Issuer as Senior Secured Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Ranking and Priority_**

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements that will constitute, for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management
Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco Liabilities, Super Senior
Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities or Unsecured Liabilities (each a “New Debt Financing”). The conditions
include certification by the Issuer that such New Debt Financing is not prohibited under the terms of
the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, setoff, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing
arrangement under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any
New Debt Financing, each agent in respect of any Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent (and each
other person party to a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security
Document) is authorized and instructed to enter promptly into any new security document, promptly
amend or waive any term of an existing security document and/or promptly release any asset from the
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) and/or to effect
the ranking, priority guarantees and security of the New Debt Financing subject to certain conditions,
including as regards the terms of such new security (which shall be, unless otherwise required by the
Issuer), substantially the same as the terms of the existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security). Any release and re-grant of Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security may only be undertaken if (i) (A) required under the New Debt Financing; (B)
necessary under applicable law to give effect to the ranking as described under “—Priority of Security”
above; or (C) the Issuer has determined in good faith that it is either not possible or not desirable to
implement the New Debt Financing on terms satisfactory to the Issuer by instead granting additional
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) and/or amending
the terms of the existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case
may be); and (ii) if any asset is to be released from Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security (as the case may be), promptly upon giving effect to that release, replacement
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) is, subject to
certain conditions, granted in favor of the Security Agent for and on behalf of the providers and/or
agents and/or trustees of the New Debt Financing and (in relation to the Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be)) the existing Secured Parties (or relevant class
thereof) or Topco Creditors (as the case may be) benefitting from the Security on substantially the same
terms as the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be)
released (except that it shall also secure any New Debt Financing). Each Secured Party agrees (i) not to
take any action to challenge the validity or enforceability of additional Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) by reason of it being expressed to be second
ranking; (ii) that additional Transaction Security may be granted by any Debtor to secure all or any part
of any Hedging Liabilities and/or New Debt Financing and (iii) the Additional Topco Independent


-----

Transaction Security may be granted by any Topco Independent Obligor to secure all or any part of any
New Debt Financing.

or in respect of any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited by the
terms of the Finance Documents and which is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a
person or any of its subsidiaries who becomes a Restricted Subsidiary after the Closing Date or (ii) a
person that merges, consolidates or is otherwise combined with a Restricted Subsidiary after the Closing
Date, or (iii) the assets of or shares in any person listed in paragraphs (i) or (ii) above or otherwise
acquired after the Closing Date (together an “Acquired Person or Asset”), shall be permitted to subsist
(or to be granted in accordance with the applicable terms) and there is no requirement to offer that
security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of any other liabilities under any Debt
Document.

No security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is required to be given by any member
of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i) over any
Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group
or is excluded or exempt from being given under the Agreed Security Principles, (ii) over any asset
required (including subject to any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any Permitted
Acquired Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation to extend any Transaction Security
ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired

Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against
loss is prevented by the documentation in relation to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would
give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation but not including an obligation to extend
any Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in
relation thereto.

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date falling one Business Day
after the date on which, following the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured
Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities
(a “Second Lien Event of Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (each as
defined below)) issues a notice (a “Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any debt facilities
advanced to Topco (each a “Topco Facility”) (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under any Topco
Notes (the “Topco Notes Trustee”) advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group
of the Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity
of the relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco
Payment Stop Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default
has been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Majority
Super Senior Creditors, Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Second Lien Creditors
(each as defined below) gave the instructions to deliver the relevant stop notice) delivers a
notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes Trustee cancelling the
payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).


-----

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a particular
Senior Secured Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the
occurrence of the relevant event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be
served (i) with respect to the same event or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of
a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien
Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that
failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities or (ii) the issue of an
enforcement notice in respect of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any
Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the second lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability
to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable
Debt Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and
capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue
notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior
Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice
ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or
Second Lien Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or (in respect
of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) to Topco or any party that has acceded to the
Intercreditor Agreement as a Topco Investor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement, the
“Topco Investors”) an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the Topco
Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable) and which would
have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop Notice or Senior
Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco
Proceeds Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result
of that suspension of payments shall be waived without any further action being required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the
latest to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien
Discharge Date and the first date (the “Topco Discharge Date”) on which all of the Topco Liabilities
have been fully discharged (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured
Creditor) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party
Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to
the creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either
(x) not prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”;


-----

(ii) other than where the set-off provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement apply, any amount by
way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(iii) notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii) above and other than where the set-off provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement apply, any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the

creditors under the Debt Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration
event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other litigation or proceedings
against a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any Third Party
Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as
defined below)); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the

occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction
Security as a result of such an acceleration event, other than, in each case, any
amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out below
under “—Application of Proceeds”; and in the case of Intra-Group Liabilities,
any amount received or recovered in accordance with the relevant provisions
in the Intercreditor Agreement (to the extent permitted to be received or
recovered notwithstanding that an acceleration event is continuing);

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with
the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) (other than in respect of the provisions set out under “New Debt Financing” above or where the
set-off provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement apply) any distribution in cash or in kind or
payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any Debtor, any
member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider which is not in
accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is
made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as defined below) in respect
of that Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received
or recovered) on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent
and promptly pay or distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount
equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to
the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;
and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time prior to the
Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from any Obligor, any member
of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the enforcement
of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event or the
enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts
which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent for application in accordance


-----

with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” except in accordance with such
provisions.

The relationship of the Security Agent to the Creditors is construed to be as one of principal and agent
in relation to any jurisdiction the courts of which would not recognize or give effect to the trust
expressed to be created by this turnover mechanism.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Obligor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any
resolution or making of an order for its insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration
or reorganization (excluding solvent reorganizations), (b) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of
its indebtedness, (c) the appointment of any liquidator, receiver, examiner, administrative receiver,
administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or any of its assets, or (d)
any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each case), frivolous or
vexatious proceedings (which, if capable of remedy, are discharged, stayed or dismissed within 20
Business Days of commencement or, if earlier, the date on which it is advertised), any proceedings or
appointments which the Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or will be unsuccessful or as
permitted under any Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement,
or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party
entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of an Obligor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider (in the case of a
Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall
direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the
liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such
distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds”
below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities
to creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in
the case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of
enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off
shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that setoff to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application
_of Proceeds” below._

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the
extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make
demands, collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery
after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to an Obligor (as defined in the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security
Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give
effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_


-----

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the
Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent
of an Instructing Group or otherwise as specified in the provisions described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super
Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”),
Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50%
of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior
Secured Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than 50% of the Super
Senior Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that, for instructions relating to
enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in
accordance with the enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of Transaction
_Security” below;_

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date
but before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than 50% of
the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise in
accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has become
enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish
to issue enforcement instructions they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement
Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,
(ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of
enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial
Enforcement Notice or if the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the
Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date
has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by
enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the
Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce
the Transaction Security or on the expected realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior
Creditors deliver instructions before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date
has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior
Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as
applicable) have not given instructions or they (A) have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce (or
to cease enforcing) the Transaction Security, or (B) have not required any Debtor or Third Party Security
Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Majority Second Lien Creditors (where the rights of the
Majority Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement), or (vi) if,
prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they (A)
have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce (or to cease enforcing) the Transaction Security, or
(B) have not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the


-----

Majority Topco Creditors (where the rights of the Majority Topco Creditors to enforce have arisen
under the Intercreditor Agreement).

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second
Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions do not give such
instructions and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement
instructions as described in the paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce
the Transaction Security as they see fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that
(i) to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of
enforcement chosen should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds
must be received in cash and (iii) enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if

not carried out by way of a public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent
is request to do so by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit
from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of accountants or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with
its terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Topco Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or
refrain from enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance
with any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including the selection of any administrator
of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any persons
entitled at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such
instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers
arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than
the Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with
the paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien
Creditors, with appropriate modifications for their relative position in the capital structure.

Group which owes any liabilities or has given security or guarantees in respect of liabilities
owed to a creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement or any of such Third Party Security
Provider or member of the Topco Group’s assets or any suspension of payments or moratorium
of any indebtedness of any such Third Party Security Provider or member of the Topco Group,

Finance Documents.

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not apply
in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities or any Transaction Security securing the Topco Group
Liabilities, if:

(i) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement
(the “Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities, and Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default

Liabilities;

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and (iv) the Relevant Topco Default

notifying any agent under a Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Senior Agent”), any

in relation to a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at
any later time, a further Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other event of default in
respect of the Topco Liabilities.

“Topco Guarantor” means a guarantor in relation to a Topco Facility or a guarantor in relation to any
debt financing which is designated at a “Topco Notes” financing by the Issuer (in its discretion by
written notice to the facility agent (each such financing constituting “Topco Notes”).

Agreement), Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Second Lien
Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to
prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors must
also elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders
in exchange (subject to specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such
hedging obligations had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection
with any such purchase.

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to
any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security document
agrees that it shall (and is irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further
consent, agreement or instruction from any creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly following
receipt of a written request from the Issuer:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any

asset which the Issuer has confirmed is the subject of (1) a disposal not
prohibited under any Finance Document (or where any applicable release and/
or consent has been obtained) including a disposal to a member of the Senior
Secured Group but without prejudice to any obligation of any member of the
Senior Secured Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement security,
and (2) any other transaction not prohibited by any Finance Document (or
where any applicable release and/ or consent has been obtained) pursuant to
which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Senior
Secured Group and, in each case, where such disposal is not a Distressed
Disposal (as defined below) (in each case, a “Non-Distressed Disposal”);


-----

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any

document or other agreement requested in order for any member of the Senior
Secured Group to effect any amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any
rights, comply with any obligation or take any action in relation to such
document or agreement, in each case to the extent the Issuer has confirmed that
such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document;

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any

asset of any member of the Senior Secured Group which has ceased or will
cease to be a Debtor or guarantor to the extent that the Issuer has confirmed
that such cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of each Finance
Document or the Agreed Security Principles; and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any

other asset to the extent that the Issuer has confirmed that such security is not
required to be given or such release is otherwise in accordance with the terms
of any Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles;

(ii) in the case of a disposal of shares or ownership interests in a Debtor or other member of the
Senior Secured Group (or a holding company of any Debtor) or any other transaction pursuant
to which a Debtor or other member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company of any
Debtor) will cease to be a member of the Topco Group or a Debtor (including by way of
resignation or being designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary (as defined in the Existing
Indenture)), release or procure the release of that Debtor or other member of the Senior Secured
Group and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt
Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents
(including any claim relating to a Debt Document); and

(iii) effect a Debt Transfer (as defined below).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B) or (ii) above, the Issuer
must confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited
by the terms of any Finance Document, in each case, as the case may be, as at the date of completion
of such release or, at the option of the Issuer, on the date that the definitive agreement for such disposal
or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Issuer must
confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant
release or cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed
Security Principles.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor or member of the Senior
Secured Group (or a holding company of any Debtor) or any other transaction pursuant to which a
Debtor or member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company of any Debtor) will cease to be
a member of Topco Group or a Debtor (including by way of resignation or being designated an
Unrestricted Subsidiary), to the extent the Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that such disposal,
transaction or designation is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco
Group or a Debtor is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person shall
have the right to voluntarily prepay all liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document and any right
to decline, delay or prevent any such prepayment in any Debt Document shall be disapplied (but without
prejudice to any prepayment fees, make-whole payment, break costs or other payment required by the
relevant Finance Documents).

In the case of a Debt Transfer (defined below), the Issuer may at any time require that all of the rights
and obligations of any Super Senior Borrower, Senior Borrower or Second Lien Borrower (each as


-----

defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (a “Borrower”) in respect of its liabilities (including borrowing
liabilities) under the applicable Secured Debt Documents be novated or otherwise transferred by that
Borrower (a “Debt Transfer”) provided that (i) either: (A) such Debt Transfer is to another member of
the Senior Secured Group; (B) such Debt Transfer is by a Borrower where (I) that Borrower or any
holding company of that Borrower is being disposed of in accordance with the Finance Documents, and
(II) the proceeds of such disposal are not otherwise required to be applied unconditionally in prepayment
of that Borrower’s borrowing liabilities under the applicable Finance Documents; or (C) such Debt
Transfer is undertaken in connection with an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured
Group (or a holding company thereof); and (ii) the transferee in respect of such Debt Transfer is (in the
case of a Super Senior Borrower) another Super Senior Borrower, or (in the case of a Senior Borrower
or Second Lien Borrower) another Senior Borrower or (in the case of a Second Lien Borrower) another
Second Lien Borrower. Any Debt Transfer may (and shall upon the request of the Company) be effected
on a cashless basis, by way of book entries and not as physical cash movement to repay and reborrow
any applicable liabilities.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by
a member of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any assets or
shares or financial securities which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a)
at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become
enforceable as a result of an acceleration event, (b) by enforcement of the Transaction Security as a
result of an acceleration event, or (c) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement
of security as a result of an acceleration event, by a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person
or persons which is not a member of the Senior Secured Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized
(subject to acting in accordance with certain conditions set out below and at the cost of the relevant
Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or
further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider
or Debtor):

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of
that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating
charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary
or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that
Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or
other liabilities, (B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that
Debtor over any of its assets and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor,
Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor to release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from
all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities, (B) any Transaction Security
granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its
assets and (C) any other claim of an intra- group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated
Creditor or a Debtor over that holding company’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of
that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or


-----

holding company or any of their subsidiaries to creditors under the Debt Documents or to any
Debtors:

(A) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor

Agreement) does not intend that any transferee of those liabilities (the
“Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to
dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any
other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a
Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and

(B) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor

Agreement) does intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party
for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter
into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed
to the Secured Parties and all or part of any other liabilities, on behalf of, in
each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all
or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that
Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group

liabilities or liabilities to any Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group
lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the
Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed

Entity which is also a guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the
transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities
or liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving
Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as
described in paragraph (iv) above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance
with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the
proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities
as described in paragraph (iv) above has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities as described in paragraphs (iv) and
(v)above) effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable
care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent shall
not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to
achieve a higher price) and shall in all cases comply with the provisions set out below.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled
to give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent
is not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities
or guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the
case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary


-----

facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant Senior Creditor)
following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to
give, and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is
not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those
borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien
Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of
credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral
arrangements acceptable to the relevant Senior Creditor) following that release.

Where borrowing guarantee or other liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien
Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities, Topco Liabilities or unsecured liabilities
would otherwise be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect
to have those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Issuer,
in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the
Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor)
to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities.

Subject to the provisions described below, if a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant
to paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected by or at the request of the Security Agent, unless the
consent of each Senior Agent and each Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) has been obtained,
it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that:

(i) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(ii) such sale or disposal is made (A) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process
conducted with the advice of a reputable, independent or financially recognized investment
bank or firm of accountants (or (if all such banks or firms are conflicted), a reputable,
independent and internationally recognized third party professional firm which is regularly
engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those subject
to the relevant Transaction Security) and, in each, case not being an auditor or administrator of
the applicable company (a “Financial Adviser”) as selected by the Security Agent, in respect of
which the Secured Creditors are entitled to participate (a “Competitive Sales Process”); or (B)
where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion (including
an enterprise valuation of the Group) that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with
such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security
Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it has been
indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Second Lien Liabilities or Transaction
Security securing Second Lien Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities has approved the release,
transfer or disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities
are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially

all in cash); and


-----

(B) at completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to

the extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to
each of the Secured Creditors and Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors and their
subsidiaries being sold and disposed of (together, the “Relevant Claim”) are
(to the same extent) unconditionally released and discharged or sold or
disposed of (and not assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates), and all security
under documents creating security in respect of the secured obligations in
respect of the assets of such members of the Senior Secured Group is
unconditionally released and discharged, provided that, if each Senior Agent
and Senior Secured Notes Trustee (1) (acting reasonably and in good faith)
determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater cash
amount if the Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser
or its affiliates and provided such amount is nevertheless less than the
aggregate amount of outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities (which shall be
deemed to be the case if there are no bidders or if each Senior Agent and Senior
Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that
there are no bona fide and fully committed bids in cash or substantially all in
cash in excess of the outstanding amount of Senior Secured Liabilities) and (2)
serves written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, then the
Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such Relevant
Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is

made pursuant to a Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser
selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion (including an
enterprise valuation of the Senior Secured Group) that the proceeds received
or recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial
point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the
method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent has no
obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it has been
indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Topco Liabilities or Transaction Security
securing Topco Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Topco Liabilities has approved the release, transfer or
disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Topco Liabilities are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially

all in cash); and

(B) at completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to

the extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to
each of the Secured Creditors and Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors and their
subsidiaries being sold and disposed of (a “Relevant Claim”) are (to the same
extent) unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of (and not
assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates), and all security under documents
creating security in respect of the secured obligations in respect of the assets
of such members of the Senior Secured Group is unconditionally released and
discharged, provided that, if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes
Trustee and each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities
(acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Priority Secured


-----

Parties will recover a greater amount if the Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise
transferred to the purchaser or its affiliates and provided such amount is
nevertheless less than the aggregate amount of outstanding Priority Secured
Liabilities (which shall be deemed to be the case if there are no bidders or if
each Senior Agent, Senior Secured Notes Trustee and each agent and trustee
in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting reasonably and in good faith)
determines that there are no bona fide and fully committed bids in cash or
substantially all in cash in excess of the outstanding amount of the Priority
Secured Liabilities), then the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to
sell and transfer such Relevant Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is

made pursuant to a Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser
selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion (including an
enterprise valuation of the Group) that the proceeds received or recovered in
connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of view
taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of
enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation
to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it has been indemnified and/or
secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

When acting for the purposes of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall always act (i) if the
relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the Transaction Security in
accordance with the provisions set out under “—Manner of Enforcement” above, and (ii) in any other
case on the instructions of the Instructing Group or, in the absence of such instructions, as the Security
Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after
the first date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the
resulting losses are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their
respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that
specified class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments
amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position
that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended
or waived only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the
Security Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class
of creditors, and such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or
adversely to affect the interests of the other classes of creditors, only the written agreement from the
relevant agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected class shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates
to, among other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above, the order of
priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement or the provisions set out under “—
_Turnover” above (other than an amendment or waiver which is consequential to or required to_
implement a Permitted Structural Adjustment (as defined in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement)) shall not be made without the consent of (i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in
accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior
Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities, (ii) each Cash Management Facility
Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect


-----

the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement
and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of
creditors), (iii) each Hedge Counterparty (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (only to the extent
that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of
such Hedge Counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect
the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), and (iv) the Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such
instructions or authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented
or authorized relate to any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee
in its capacity as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), (A) the Security
Agent may, if the Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or
grant consents under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security which shall be binding on each party; and (B) the Security Agent may, if the Issuer consents,
and shall promptly upon the request of the Issuer, amend, release and/or retake any Transaction Security
Document where such amendment, release and/or retake is required in order to ensure the validity,
perfection or priority of the Transaction Security purported to be created under such Transaction
Security Document, together with any related or consequential waiver (including by reason of a failure
to register such Transaction Security Document with Companies House within the prescribed time limit
set out in section 859 of the Companies Act 2006, in which case the Security Agent shall also
irrevocably waive any payment or other obligation or default arising out of such failure to register) and
any such amendment, release, waiver and retake shall be binding on each Party. Where any such
amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under any document creating Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject
to Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or the manner in which the proceeds
of enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are distributed,
the prior consent of (i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance
documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and
the Topco Liabilities, (ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed
amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash
Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely
affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), (iii) each Hedge Counterparty
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver
would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the
Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any
other creditor or class of creditors), and (iv) the Issuer, will be required.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or
obligations which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such
(including, without limitation, any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the
Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case
may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the paragraphs above under “—Required Consents” and under “—
_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under_
the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to (i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security claims or liabilities, or (ii) to any amendment waiver or consent,
which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor


-----

Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under
“—New Debt Financings,” “—Non-Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed Disposals” above or as
contemplated by the terms of any Debt Document or is consequential to or required to implement a
Permitted Structural Adjustment. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent effected in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be effected solely by
the Issuer and the Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent in relation to any of the terms of an applicable document, to
participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any action or to provide any confirmation or
notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt Document (other than a
Notes Indenture) which does not contain a snooze/lose provision substantially equivalent to that
described in this paragraph or which contains a longer period, any creditor fails to respond to the request
within ten Business Days (or any other period of time notified by the Issuer, with the agreement of each
of the agents or trustee in the case of a shorter period of time) or fails to provide details of its credit
participation, such creditor will be disregarded or be deemed to have zero participation in respect of the
matter or be deemed to have provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable. However,
this provision shall not apply to any noteholder in respect of a request where such noteholder is not
given the option to respond to such request in the negative but shall otherwise apply to all noteholders.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an “IPO”) but not earlier than the Engineering Merger Date (as defined in the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt
Documents will automatically operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and
all related provisions) will now refer to the member of the Senior Secured Group or holding company
of the Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO
Pushdown Entity,” and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the date of such IPO,
the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Issuer which is the issuer or borrower of
any Topco Liabilities) and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made
excluding any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (iii) certain provisions of the Debt
Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of default) will cease to apply to any
holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity.

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the
Debt Documents (including any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security) and
each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security Provider, Investor (as defined in the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor will be released from its
obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities,
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders
under and as defined in any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50%
of any Second Lien Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility
and noteholders representing more than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (in each case following the
relevant IPO), the Issuer and each subsidiary of the Issuer shall also be released from all obligations as
Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from the Transaction Security (other than, in each
case, borrowing liabilities).

Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment, release or
replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate the matters described in each of the above
paragraphs under the heading “—Provisions following an IPO” provided that such amendment,
replacement or other document or instrument does not impose personal obligations on the Security


-----

Agent or affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunity of the Security Agent under
such amendment, release, replacement or other document or instrument.

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other
Debt Documents to the contrary.

**Existing Company Indebtedness**

**_2020 BPM Facility_**

On October 13, 2020, the Company entered into a facilities agreement with Banco BPM S.p.A. (the
“2020 BPM Facility”). The 2020 BPM Facility provides for term loans in an aggregate principal amount
of €15.0 million. The term loans under the 2020 BPM Facility may be applied in or towards financing
the general corporate purposes and working capital requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The 2020 BPM Facility is unsecured and unguaranteed, and the term loans drawn thereunder amortize
in equal semi-annual instalments until June 30, 2024 (being the final repayment date). The term loans
bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR plus an applicable margin, which is subject to a
decreasing margin ratchet based on the senior secured net leverage ratio. If EURIBOR is less than zero,
EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of the term loans under the 2020 BPM Facility. A
commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and un-cancelled amount of the 2020 BPM
Facility during its availability period. The term loans may be voluntarily prepaid and/or cancelled in
part or in full at any time without premium or penalty (save for customary break costs). The 2020 BPM
Facility includes representations and warranties, information covenants, undertakings, events of default
and similar provisions, similar to those under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. As of
December 31, 2022, €5.6 million were outstanding under the 2020 BPM Facility.

**_Working capital facilities_**

We are a party to certain uncommitted bilateral and guarantee facilities agreements with Italian banks,
providing the Group with certain overdraft arrangements, receivables discounting, short-term and
working capital facilities. The purpose of these uncommitted bilateral facilities is to finance our ordinary
course of business activities as well as our liquidity and working capital needs. As a result, we generally
draw and repay these lines in the ordinary course of business as part of our cash management and to
meet our working capital requirements. These facilities are unsecured and unguaranteed. The lenders
under these agreements can withdraw these facilities at any time.

In particular, the Company has four uncommitted working capital facilities (hot money facility) which
it can use to fund its liquidity needs, including one uncommitted facilities with Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A.
for an aggregate available amount of up to €15.0 million, one uncommitted facility with Crédit Agricole
for an aggregate available amount of up to €20.0 million, one uncommitted facility with BPM for an
aggregate available amount of up to €1.5 million, and one uncommitted facility with Banca Monte dei
Paschi di Siena for an aggregate available amount of up to €16.5 million (together, the “Hot Money
Facilities”). The interest rate under each Hot Money Facility is customarily agreed between the relevant
parties upon utilization on a case by case basis. The Hot Money Facilities can be withdrawn by the
relevant lenders at any time. The Hot Money Facilities are unsecured and unguaranteed.

As of December 31, 2022, €21.5 million were outstanding under these working capital facilities,
including €21.5 million under the Hot Money Facilities.

**_Guarantee facilities_**


-----

Some entities of the Group are parties to certain guarantee facilities with certain Italian banks and credit
institutions. We generally utilize these guarantee facilities in order to guarantee the performance of our
obligations under certain commercial agreements to which we are a party vis-à-vis clients in our Public
Administration industry vertical. Outstanding letters of guarantee under these facilities are not treated
as financial debt in our consolidation statement of financial position.

**_Uncommited Factoring Agreements_**

We are party to certain framework factoring agreements, pursuant to which we assign from time to time
a part of our trade receivables on an uncommitted, non-recourse basis (pro soluto). Such transactions
are governed by certain framework agreements with primary credit institutions, in accordance to which
we assign our receivables to the relevant factor in order to ensure prompt payment and, more generally,
to manage our working capital requirements. The terms and conditions of our factoring agreements are
market standard for these transactions and typically include, inter alia, the obligations to administer the
collections on the trade receivables and to provide any information regarding the creditworthiness of
the assigned debtor. In return, at the time of sale of the trade receivables, we receive from our factoring
counterparties an amount representing the nominal amount of the total assigned trade receivables. We
are also party to certain reverse factoring agreements pursuant to which our suppliers regularly assign
to the relevant factoring counterparties a part of the trade receivables owed by us to them. Amounts
outstanding under both non-recourse (pro soluto) and reverse factoring agreements are not treated as
financial debt in our consolidated statement of financial position.

**_Intesa Securitization Programs_**

_First Intesa Securitization Program_

In March, 2022, the Company and its subsidiary EDH entered into a committed framework factoring
agreement with Manno SPV S.r.l., a third party securitization vehicle (the “Purchaser”) indirectly
controlled by Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., governing the terms of the sale of certain trade receivables arising
in the ordinary course of business to the Purchaser, on a non-recourse basis (pro soluto), for an overall
amount of up to €150.0 million (the “First Intesa Securitization Program”). The receivables transferred
by the Group pursuant to the First Intesa Securitization Program are used as underlying by the Purchaser
in the context of securitization transactions consisting in the issuance of limited-recourse asset-backed
securities in accordance with Law 130/1999. We assign our receivables pursuant to the First Intesa
Securitization Program in order to ensure prompt payment and, more generally, to support our working
capital and other liquidity needs. In return, at the time of sale of the trade receivables, we receive from
the Purchaser an amount based on the face value of the total assigned trade receivables, less a discount
calculated through the operation of certain applicable margins and financial discount factors. The
purchase price for the transferred receivables under the First Intesa Securitization Program is paid by
the Purchaser into an account pledged for the benefit of the Purchaser.

We believe that the terms and conditions of the First Intesa Securitization Program are market standard
for this type of transactions and include, inter alia, debtor eligibility and portfolio determination criteria,
as well as general cooperation undertakings. The First Intesa Securitization Program also provides for
customary representations and warranties by the Company and EDH in addition to information
undertakings and similar provisions. The First Intesa Securitization Program has a duration of three
years, expiring in February 2025, and is subject to early withdrawal and termination rights which are
triggered, inter alia, in the event of default in the timely payment by the Group under other indebtedness
with a principal amount of €20 million or higher, or a change of control of the Issuer, EDH and,
following consummation of the Engineering Merger, MergerCo, in accordance with the provisions set
forth in the Existing Indenture. The First Intesa Securitization Program is governed by Italian law.
Amounts outstanding under the First Intesa Securitization Program are not treated as financial debt in
our consolidated statement of financial position. As of December 31, 2022, €110.7 million were
outstanding under the First Intesa Securitization Program, while €39.3 million were available for
drawing.


-----

In addition to the First Intesa Securitization Program, the Company, EDH and the Purchaser, among
others, concurrently entered into (i) a sub-servicing agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed
to facilitate the administration of transferred receivables by conducting credit collection and
management activities, among other things, and (ii) a bank account pledge agreement, whereby a pledge
over the bank account on which the Purchaser transfers the purchase price for the transferred receivables
was created.

_Second Intesa Securitization Program_

In October 2021, the Company entered into a framework factoring agreement with Massi S.r.l., a third
party securitization vehicle (“Massi”) indirectly controlled by Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., governing the
terms of the sale of trade receivables from Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. to Massi, on a non-recourse basis
(pro soluto) (the “Second Intesa Securitization Program”). Pursuant to the Second Intesa Securitization
Program, the Company may propose the sale of eligible existing and future receivables to Massi, which
retains the ability to reject the proposed sale or to accept it and state a proposed sale price (including
the applicable discount to face value). We assign our receivables from Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. pursuant
to the Second Intesa Securitization Program in order to ensure prompt payment and, more generally, to
support our working capital and other liquidity needs. In return, at the time of sale of the trade
receivables, we receive from Massi an amount based on the face value of the trade receivables assigned
from time to time, less the relevant discount determined by Massi and accepted by the Company in
connection with any given sale.

The Second Intesa Securitization Program is open-ended, and may be terminated by either party by
providing a 15 business day notice. The Second Intesa Securitization Program is governed by Italian
law. Amounts outstanding under the Second Intesa Securitization Program are not treated as financial
debt in our consolidated statement of financial position. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we
have sold €122.6 million trade receivables under the Second Intesa Securitization Program.

**_Lease agreements_**

A number of entities in the Group are parties to certain lease agreements in respect of several assets,
including buildings, cars and IT equipment. The average useful life of the relevant right-of-use asset is
6, 2 and 3 years, respectively. None of these financial lease agreements includes significant renewal
clauses and/or extension options, provides for variable lease payments nor involves sale and lease back
options. As of December 31, 2022, the overall amount outstanding in connection with financial lease
agreements was €168.9 million.

**_Grants and subsidized financings_**

Certain entities of the Group have been awarded with certain grants and subsidized financing by public
entities, including European and local authorities, in order to finance the realization of certain projects.
In general terms, public grants are not regarded as debt as they do not provide for the repayment of the
amounts made available thereunder. However, subsidized financing include amortization plans in
accordance to which the relevant amounts are to be repaid to the relevant provider.

**_Be Indebtedness_**

Be’s total indebtedness as of December 31, 2022, was €53.7 million, consisting primarily of
indebtedness incurred under medium and long-term unsecured facilities as well as under ordinary
course business overdrafts, guarantee lines (linee per firma) and other cash management lines, and
excluding €13.5 million of put and call liabilities and €10.4 million of IFRS 16 liabilities.

From time to time following the date of this Offering Memorandum, we may repay a portion of Be’s
existing indebtedness using cash on balance sheet and/or drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility, in any case, subject to compliance with applicable laws.


-----

**Existing Funding Loan**

On July 23, 2020, the Issuer, as lender, entered into an intercompany loan agreement, governed by
Italian law, with the Company, as borrower, for an amount equal to approximately €114.4 million (as
amended on October 7, 2022, the “Existing Funding Loan”), in connection with the Engineering
Acquisition. Interest on the Existing Funding Loan accrues at a rate equal to the three month EURIBOR
(subject to a 0.0% floor) plus 5.50% per annum. The maturity date of the Existing Funding Loan shall
occur on or about the maturity date of the Existing Notes. The Existing Funding Loan does not provide
for any undertakings or representations by the parties.

The Issuer’s interest in the receivables under the Existing Funding Loan was pledged as part of the
collateral securing the Existing Notes, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Term
Loan, and will be pledged on the same basis as part of the Collateral securing the Notes offered hereby.
The agreement governing the Existing Funding Loan is governed by Italian law.

As a consequence of the Engineering Merger, the Existing Funding Loan will be terminated and the
security interests over the Issuer’s interest in the receivables in respect of the Existing Funding Loan
will cease to exist by operation of law. Subject to certain significant exceptions, the Existing Funding
Loan documentation prohibits the repayment, reduction, extinction or equitization of the Existing
Funding Loan. Such exceptions include, but are not limited to, the repayment of the Existing Funding
Loan to enable the Issuer to make payments of principal and interest on the Existing Notes and the
Existing Term Loan and, upon request of the Issuer, the partial repayment of the Existing Funding Loan
in an amount not exceeding €15.0 million during the tenor of the Existing Funding Loan. The Existing
Indenture does not, and the Indenture will not include any restrictions on the Issuer or the Company to
amend the Existing Funding Loan documentation, including to permit the repayment of the Existing
Funding Loan in order to allow the Issuer to discharge other debt secured by the Collateral.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security Interests—The
_principal amount of the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loans forming part of the_
_Collateral may be less than anticipated as a result of prepayments of certain indebtedness of the Group_
_prior to the maturity date of the Notes” and “Risk factors— Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral—The Issuer’s right to receive payments under the Existing Funding Loan and the_
_Overlord Funding Loan I prior to the Engineering Merger (if it occurs) may be subordinated by law to_
_the obligations of other creditors, and the Overlord Funding Loan II is expected to be eliminated in_
_connection with the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger.”_

**Overlord Funding Loans**

On or about the First Be Acquisition Closing Date, in order to distribute the proceeds from the Bridge
Facility and the Sellers’ Reinvestment, as applicable, from the Issuer to Overlord Bidco to be used in
connection with the Transactions, we entered into the following intercompany funding loan agreements:
(i) a first intercompany loan agreement by and between the Issuer, as lender, and the Company, as
borrower, providing for an aggregate principal amount of up to €385 million (the “Overlord Funding
Loan I”), and (ii) a second back-to-back intercompany loan agreement entered by and between the
Company, as lender, and Overlord Bidco, as borrower, providing for an aggregate principal amount of
up to €385 million (the “Overlord Funding Loan II” and, together with the Overlord Funding Loan I,
collectively, the “Overlord Funding Loans”).

Interest on each of the Overlord Funding Loans accrues at a rate equal to the three month EURIBOR
(subject to a 0.0% floor) plus 8.75% per annum. The maturity date of each of the Overlord Funding
Loans shall occur on or about the maturity date of the Notes. The Overlord Funding Loans do not
provide for any undertakings or representations by the relevant parties.

The Company’s interests in the receivables under the Overlord Funding Loan II will be pledged on the
Issue Date as part of the Initial Collateral securing the Notes. The Issuer’s interests in the receivables


-----

under the Overlord Funding Loan I will be pledged within 30 days from (and excluding) the Issue Date
as part of the Post-Issue Date Collateral (if any). The agreements governing the Overlord Funding Loans
are governed by Italian law.

Subject to certain significant exceptions, the Overlord Funding Loans documentation, however,
prohibits the repayment, reduction, extinction or equitization of the Overlord Funding Loans. Such
exceptions include, but are not limited to the ability for the Issuer to make payments of principal and
interest on the Existing Term Loan, the Existing Note and the Notes and, upon request of the relevant
lender under the respective Overlord Funding Loan, as applicable, the partial repayment of such relevant
Overlord Funding Loan in an amount not exceeding €50.0 million during the tenor of such Overlord
Funding Loan. Pursuant to these exceptions, the Issuer may, among other things, cause directly or
indirectly the reduction and/or cancellation of either or both of the Overlord Funding Loans in the event
of any mandatory or optional redemption of the Existing Notes at final maturity or prior thereto, which
would have an adverse effect on the Guarantees granted by the Company and/or Overlord Bidco, as
applicable, in respect of the Notes offered hereby and the security interests over the receivables in
respect of the Overlord Funding Loans, the value of which may reduce to zero in certain circumstances.
Moreover, the Indenture will not include any restrictions on the Issuer or the Company to amend the
Overlord Funding Loans documentation, including to permit the repayment of the Overlord Funding
Loans in order to allow the Issuer to discharge other debt secured by the Collateral. See also “—Risks
_Related to Our Capital Structure—The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating_
_operations of its own and prior to the Engineering Merger will depend exclusively on cash from the_
_operating companies of the Group to be able to make payments on the Notes.” Upon completion of the_
Engineering Merger, the security interests in the Overlord Funding Loan I will cease to exist
automatically, while the security interests in the Overlord Funding Loan II will remain in place, until
the date of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, at which point the security interests in the Overlord
Funding Loan II will also automatically cease to exist.

The principal amounts then outstanding under the Overlord Funding Loans shall be automatically and
immediately reduced, from time to time, by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or
termination of the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan made, directly or indirectly,
by the Company and/or Overlord Bidco (as applicable) and/or any subsidiary of the Company including
as a result of the enforcement of the Guarantee and/or security interests granted by the Company and/or
Overlord Bidco (as applicable) and/or any subsidiary of the Company under the Notes.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, €385 million are outstanding under each of the Overlord
Funding Loans. For a detailed description of the various drawings made under each of the Overlord
Funding Loans in connection with the Transactions, please see “Summary—The Transactions—The
_Financing of the Be Acquisition.”_

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security Interests—The
_principal amount of the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loans forming part of the_
_Collateral may be less than anticipated as a result of prepayments of certain indebtedness of the Group_
_prior to the maturity date of the Notes.” and “Risk factors— Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral—The Issuer’s right to receive payments under the Existing Funding Loan and the_

_connection with the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger.”_

**Existing PIK Notes**

In connection with the Engineering Acquisition, on July 22, 2020, TopCo issued €216.5 million of
senior secured PIK pay-if-you-want notes due 2028 in a private placement. The Existing PIK Notes will
mature eight years after the Engineering Acquisition Closing Date, unless earlier redeemed or
repurchased and cancelled in accordance with the indenture governing the Existing PIK Notes.


-----

Interest on the Existing PIK Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in cash or in kind at the sole
option of TopCo, provided that the last interest payment will be made entirely in cash.

The Existing PIK Notes are not guaranteed and are secured by security interests over the shares of
TopCo and TopCo’s material bank accounts in Italy (without control over use) as well as a pledge of
loan receivables owed by TopCo to its direct parent company. The Existing PIK Notes are senior
obligations of TopCo and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the
subsidiaries of TopCo, including the Existing Notes and the Notes offered hereby, borrowings
outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Term Loan, and trade
payables and lease obligations of the Group.

The indenture governing the Existing PIK Notes, as amended and supplemented from time to time,
contains certain restrictive covenants, which, subject to certain exceptions, are substantially similar to
the covenants governing the Existing Notes. In connection with the issuance of the Existing PIK Notes,
TopCo entered into a subordination agreement to govern, _inter alia, the relationships and relative_
priorities among the holders of the Existing PIK Notes and TopCo’s shareholders.

As of February 1, 2023, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Existing PIK Notes,
including capitalized interest, was €280.3 million.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Notes Guarantee**

The Notes will:

**_The Notes Guarantee_**

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and

joint and several basis by the Company and Overlord Bidco.

A Notes Guarantee will, upon its issuance by the relevant Guarantor:

- be a senior obligation of that Guarantor;

that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee, including that

Existing Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations related thereto (if any) and the
Existing Term Loan (which will mature on September 30, 2026);

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that
is expressly subordinated to its Notes Guarantee;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that
Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure its Notes Guarantee, or which
secures such other indebtedness on a super senior basis (including obligations under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations related thereto
(if any)), to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such other indebtedness
or obligation; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the
other subsidiaries of the Issuer that does not guarantee the Notes, including obligations owed
to trade creditors of such subsidiary.


-----

The Notes Guarantees will be subject to certain contractual and legal limitations, as described under
“—Notes Guarantees” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.” By virtue of these limitations, the_
obligations of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable
with respect to the Notes, or each Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes
Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security Interests—
_“Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Revolving Credit_
_Facility Agreement.” In addition, the Notes Guarantee may be released under certain circumstances._
See “—The Notes Guarantees—Notes Guarantees Release.”

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws,
the Company also guarantees the Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Notes, the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility and the Existing Term Loan, and Overlord Bidco guarantees the Issuer’s obligations
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, in each case, on a senior secured basis. None of the
subsidiaries of the Company other than Overlord Bidco is expected to guarantee the Notes. Upon
completion of (x) the Engineering Merger, if any, MergerCo will assume the Issuer’s obligations under
the Notes and the Guarantee of the Notes by the Company is expected to be released and (y) the
Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, the Guarantee of the Notes by Overlord Bidco will be released.

A portion of the operations of the Group is conducted through Restricted Subsidiaries that are not
expected to be Guarantors and that are not expected to merge with the Issuer, including Be and its
subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and
creditors holding claims under debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims
of minority stockholders and preferred stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries generally
will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims
of creditors of the Issuer, including Holders. All of the liabilities of the Subsidiaries of the Company,
including obligations to trade creditors and creditors holding claims under debt and guarantees issued
by such Subsidiaries, will rank structurally senior to the Notes.

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Issuer and the Guarantors, before intercompany
eliminations, accounted for 59.4% of the revenue and 55.9% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of
the Group, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had been completed on January
1, 2022, and accounted for 68.1% of the consolidated total assets of the Group.

In addition, as of December 31, 2022, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and the
Guarantors would have had €34.5 million of third party indebtedness (other than the Notes, the Existing
Notes, amounts drawn under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Term Loan), none
of which was secured over assets other than the Collateral, and there would have been €145.0 million
available for drawing by the Issuer under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue € million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The
Notes will mature on, 2028. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

**Additional Notes**

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which € million in aggregate
principal amount of Notes will be issued in this offering. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an
unlimited principal amount of additional Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Notes (any
such additional Notes actually issued, the “Additional Notes”), except in respect of any of the following


-----

terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate supplied to the Trustee (copying the Paying
Agent):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear

interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such
interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment
dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be
determined, the record dates for the determination of Holders thereof to whom such interest is
payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the

currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such Additional Notes
may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms

and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof,

the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such

Additional Notes.

The Notes (and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture) will be treated as a
single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers and
amendments, but not, except upon the election of the Issuer, in respect of redemptions and offers to
purchase; provided that if any Additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income
tax purposes and/or Italian tax purposes, such Additional Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code
or common code, as applicable, from the Notes. We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in
compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenants restricting the
Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under “Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”). Unless
otherwise excluded or unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes under the Indenture and
this “Description of the Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include the Notes issued on
the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes that are actually issued.

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable
semi-annually in arrears on and      of each year, commencing on, 2023.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day or a business day at the
place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the
amount due until the next succeeding Business Day or business day at such place, as the case may be,
and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay. If a regular
record date is not a Business Day, the record date shall not be affected. The Issuer will pay interest to
the Holders of record of the Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable interest
payment date. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid,


-----

from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.

Interest on overdue principal and interest will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the applicable rate
of interest. In no event, however, will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum rate
permitted by applicable law.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be payable at the
specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with respect
to the Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held by a nominee
of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
_Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents_
maintained for such purposes in the City of London. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.”

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent will be
Elavon Financial Services DAC (the “Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”), and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”).
The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and the initial Transfer Agent will be
Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent, as applicable, will
maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will
make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

Subject to the above restrictions, the Issuer may change the Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent
for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. However, if and for so long as Notes
are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro
MTF thereof and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice
of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent on the official website of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com). The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or
Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and
certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior, joint
and several basis by the Company and Overlord Bidco.

In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles (including, among others, limitations
arising due to corporate benefit rules), if Subsidiaries of the Issuer in the future guarantee the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Term Loan or certain other Indebtedness of the Issuer permitted
under the Indenture, such Person or Persons shall also enter into one or more Notes Guarantees or
supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments to become Guarantors of the Notes and
accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of Guarantees and security interests in favor of
obligations under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Existing


-----

Term Loan. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of Guarantees where,
among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or
requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin
_capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where_
the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the
Holders.

The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which
include, among others:

- general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust
and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable
subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalization,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled
_foreign corporation,” “exchange control restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and_
“liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or
approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) to provide a guarantee or security or may
require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the
guarantee or security will be limited accordingly; _provided that the relevant member of the_
Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse
impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such
guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- the determination that the time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest
deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs, guarantee fees payable to any person
that is not a member of the Group and all applicable legal fees) related to granting the relevant
guarantee and/or security (including in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/
or registration) will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the relevant secured
parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement,
contract, lease, license, instrument or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or
condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security
document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council
(or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give
a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations
with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant charger
to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof;
_provided that reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time) to obtain consent_
to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group prior to the date
of the security or accession document that the asset is material and the Issuer is satisfied that
such endeavors will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

- the agreement that members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into
security documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not
within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the
fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or
contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a risk of personal or
criminal liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group, provided that,
to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security document
or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall, in relation to a contractual
prohibition or restriction only, use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost
and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle
or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;


-----

- the requirement that, to the extent legally effective, all security shall be given in favor of the
Security Agent and not the secured creditors individually (with the Security Agent to hold one
set of security documents for all the secured parties); provided that it shall be permissible to
use “parallel debt” provisions where necessary (which shall be included in the Intercreditor
Agreement and not the individual security documents); and furthermore, the agreement that no
member of the Group shall be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or
security as a result of any assignment or transfer of the Notes by a Holder;

- the limitation of guarantees and security so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all
registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an
amount agreed by the Issuer and the Security Agent, and the agreement that where a class of
assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over
the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted
over the material assets only;

- the agreement that security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a
third party (other than certain limited exceptions in relation to bank accounts) or any cash
constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from
any relevant security document);

- the agreement that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain
categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- the agreement that no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the
turnover or sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement and guarantees and that security
will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any
minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly owned by another member of
the Group;

- the agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or
the perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business
in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement
(including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending,
waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case
prior to a Declared Default which is continuing), and the agreement that any requirement under
the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action
shall be subject to the Agreed Security Principles; and

- the agreement that other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection,
filing or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of
the Group organized in certain excluded jurisdictions or otherwise over the shares of a member
of the Group located in any such excluded jurisdiction.

A Notes Guarantee (if any) will be subject to certain contractual and legal limitations, as described
under “—Notes Guarantees” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.” By virtue of these limitations,_
the Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable
with respect to the Notes, or the Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes
Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security Interests—
_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Revolving Credit_
_Facility Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests—Italy—Limitations on Validity and_


-----

_Enforceability of the Guarantee and Security Interests Under Italian Law.” In addition, the Note_
Guarantee may be released under certain circumstances. See “—Notes Guarantees Release.”

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws,
the Company also guarantees the Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Notes, the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility and the Existing Term Loan, and Overlord Bidco guarantees the Issuer’s obligations
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, in each case, on a senior secured basis. The Notes
Guarantees will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of such Guarantors’ existing and future
indebtedness that is not subordinated to such Notes Guarantees, and will be structurally subordinated
to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the other subsidiaries of the Issuer that
does not guarantee the Notes. None of the subsidiaries of the Company other than Overlord Bidco is
expected to guarantee the Notes. Upon completion of (x) the Engineering Merger, if any, MergerCo
will assume the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Guarantee of the Notes by the Company is
expected to be released and (y) the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, the Guarantee of the Notes by
Overlord Bidco will be released.

A portion of the operations of the Group is conducted through Restricted Subsidiaries that are not
expected to be Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including
trade creditors and creditors holding claims under debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted
Subsidiaries, and claims of minority stockholders and preferred stockholders of non-Guarantor
Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those
Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including Holders. All of the liabilities
of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not guarantee the Notes, including obligations to trade creditors
and creditors holding claims under debt and guarantees issued by the Group companies (other than the
Company), will rank structurally senior to the Notes. The Notes Guarantees will be subject to certain
material limitations. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

Although the Indenture will restrict the Incurrence of Indebtedness by the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries in excess of the limitations described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” such limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the_
Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiaries of
liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the
Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Notes Guarantees Release_**

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
upon:

(1) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, dissolution or merger) of the

Capital Stock of a Guarantor that immediately prior to such sale or other disposition was a
Subsidiary of the Issuer (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) if the sale or
other disposition does not violate the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and such Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
the sale or other disposition;

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations under the Notes or legal

defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—
_Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge;”_


-----

(4) pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor

Agreement (including as described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement— Required Consents—Provisions Following an IPO”);_

(5) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(6) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain

_Covenants—Additional Guarantees”; or_

(7) as a result of a transaction that would not be prohibited under “—Certain Covenants—Merger

_and Consolidation” (including the Engineering Merger and the Engineering-Overlord Bidco_
Merger, to the extent applicable).

At the request and expense of the Issuer and, if applicable, at the request of the Security Agent, the
Trustee shall take all reasonably necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release or
amendment of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections
and indemnifications. Each of the releases and amendments set forth above shall be effected by the
Trustee without any consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.
The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s
Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving rise
to any release or amendment of a Notes Guarantee has occurred, and that such release complies with
the Indenture.

**Security**

**_General_**

On or about the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection
requirements, the Notes will be secured by security interests in the “Initial Collateral,” consisting of a
pledge over (i) all of the shares of Overlord Bidco held by the Company and (ii) the structural
intercompany receivables owed to the Company by Overlord Bidco, including (prior to the EngineeringOverlord Bidco Merger) under the Overlord Funding Loan II.

Within 30 days from (and excluding) the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by security interests in the “Post-Issue Date
_Collateral,” consisting of a pledge (granted or reconfirmed) over (i) all of the shares of the Issuer held_
by TopCo, (ii) any structural intercompany receivables owed to TopCo by the Issuer, (iii) the material
bank accounts of the Issuer held in Italy (without control over use), (iv) all of the shares of the Company
held by the Issuer, (v) any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer by the Company,
including under the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loan I, and (vi) the shares of
Engineering D. HUB S.p.A. held by the Company. However, if the Engineering Merger becomes
effective prior to the date on which the Post-Issue Date Collateral has been granted, the Notes (x) will
not be secured by the Post-Issue Date Collateral and (y) will instead be secured, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral
within the later of 30 days from (and excluding) the Issue Date and ten Business Days from (and
excluding) the Engineering Merger Date.

Within ten Business Days from (and excluding) the Merger Date (to the extent that it occurs), the Notes
will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by
security interests in the “Post-Engineering Merger Collateral,” consisting of a pledge (granted or
reconfirmed) over (i) all of the shares of MergerCo held by each applicable holding company, (ii) the
structural intercompany receivables owed to each applicable holding company by MergerCo, (iii) the
material bank accounts of MergerCo held in Italy (without control over use), (iv) all of the shares of
Engineering D. HUB S.p.A. held by MergerCo, (v) all of the shares of Overlord Bidco held by


-----

MergerCo and (vi) the structural intercompany receivables owed to MergerCo by Overlord Bidco,
including (prior to the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger) under the Overlord Funding Loan II, and
by certain direct wholly-owned material subsidiaries of MergerCo (if any).

The Initial Collateral, the Post-Issue Date Collateral and the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral,
together with any and all assets from time to time in which a Security Interest has been or will be granted
pursuant to any Security Document to secure the obligations under the Indenture or the Notes and/or
any Notes Guarantee, in each case as may be in existence from time to time, is referred to herein as the
“Collateral.”

Following the Engineering Merger, MergerCo will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes.
Concurrently with the Engineering Merger, the Security Interests over the Issuer’s receivables in respect
of the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loan I will automatically cease to exist and (a)
in the event that the Issuer is the successor company of the Engineering Merger, the security interest
over the share capital of the Company will be extinguished by operation of law or (b) in the event that
the Company is the successor company of the Engineering Merger, the security interest over the share
capital of the Issuer will be extinguished by operation of law. To the extent applicable, certain Security
Interests granted in favor of the Notes will be re granted or re confirmed (to the extent necessary) in
accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”
following the Engineering Merger. We cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the
Engineering Merger. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security
_Interests—The Issuer’s right to receive payments under the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord_
_Funding Loan I prior to the Engineering Merger (if it occurs) may be subordinated by law to the_
_obligations of other creditors, and the Overlord Funding Loan II is expected to be eliminated in_
_connection with the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger.”_

Upon completion of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, the Overlord Funding Loan II, and any
security interest granted in respect of it, will cease to exist. The pledge on the shares of Overlord Bidco
held by the Company (or MergerCo, following the Engineering Merger) will also cease to exist as a
result of such merger, and the Notes will instead be secured by a pledge to be granted within 10 Business
Days of the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger on all the shares of Be or the entity resulting from the
Be-Be Opco Merger (as the case may be) held by the Company (or MergerCo, following the
Engineering Merger). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Be Acquisition—The Engineering_Overlord Bidco Merger will result in the release of certain security interests and Be or the resulting_
_entity of the Be-Be Opco Merger will not grant security or a Notes Guarantee in favor of the Notes.”_

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Initial Collateral also secures, and the Post-Issue Date
Collateral (and following the Engineering Merger, the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral) will secure
the Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Notes, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, certain
Hedging Obligations (if any) and the Existing Term Loan on a pari passu basis.

Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility and the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations will, in each case, contractually be
entitled to receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes, while holders
of the Existing Notes, the lender under the Existing Term Loan will contractually be entitled to receive
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes, which may further
reduce the amount of enforcement proceeds that will be available to the Holders. In addition, pursuant
to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral may also secure certain future Indebtedness
on the same basis as the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations (if any)
with respect to the receipt of proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes.
The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after all such “super senior” obligations have been
satisfied may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders.

Subject to certain conditions, and subject to the restrictions described under “—Certain Covenants—
Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer will be


-----

permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or
Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including Additional Notes, as permitted under the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral will be pledged or assigned pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent
on behalf of the Holders, the holders of the Existing Notes, the lenders under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility, the lender under the Existing Term Loan and other secured parties. Any other security
interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Notes Guarantees
and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” Any future additional Collateral (for the avoidance
of doubt, other than Collateral that is released and retaken either (i) pursuant to clause (1) under “—
_Release of Liens” or (ii) as would not be prohibited under “—Certain Covenants— Impairment of_
_Security Interest”) will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and all Collateral will be subject to_
any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under
or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that
relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose
or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and Security Interests” in this Offering Memorandum._

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of Notes. By its nature,
some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security Interests—The Notes will be_
_secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the Notes_
_and other secured indebtedness may be secured by assets that do not secure the Notes” and “—The_
_Collateral is limited to certain specific assets, the value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be_
_sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted_
_under certain circumstances.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative contractual priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by
the Security Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the
lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging
Obligations (if any), (c) the lender under the Existing Term Loan, (d) the trustee, the security agent, and
the paying agent, registrar and transfer agent and the holders of the Existing Notes, (e) the Trustee, the
Security Agent, and the Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent (collectively, the “Agents”) and
the Holders under the Indenture and (f) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness permitted to be
secured by the Collateral, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Indenture, the Notes and the Security Documents, which provide, among other things, that the
obligations of the Issuer under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations (if
any), the Existing Term Loan, the Existing Notes (including the Guarantees thereof), the Notes and the
Notes Guarantees will be secured equally and ratably by Security Interests over the Collateral. The
Intercreditor Agreement also provides, among other things, that (x) the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations (if any) will
receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes and (y) the obligations
of the Issuer under the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral on a _pari passu basis with the Notes. See “Description of Certain_
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, subject to certain limitations, the_
Collateral may be pledged to secure future Indebtedness, some of which may receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes. See “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain


-----

_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral_
_Liens.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure the payment, when
due, of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and
the Indenture, as well as the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Existing Notes,
the Guarantees thereof, the Existing Indenture, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging
Obligations (if any) and the Existing Term Loan. The Security Documents will be entered into by the
relevant security provider and the Security Agent for itself and as agent for the secured parties and also
as legal representative (mandatario con rappresentanza) under the Intercreditor Agreement and as
Security Representative. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its
own name and as mandatario con rappresentanza, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including
itself, the Trustee and the Holders of Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Agent also acts as an agent of the holders of the Existing Notes, the lenders under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations (if any) and the lender
under the Existing Term Loan in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, only the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative) will have the right to
enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such
contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the
provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent (including in its role as Security
Representative). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent (including in its role as Security
Representative) also acts on behalf of the holders of the Existing Notes, the lenders under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties under certain hedging arrangements and the lender under
the Existing Term Loan in relation to the Security Interests in favor of such parties.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security
Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged.
However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under
certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in
the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of
the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not
be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest; Limitations_**

The creditors under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to certain Hedging
Obligations secured by the Collateral, the trustee and the holders of the Existing Notes, the lender under
the Existing Term Loan and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to
have, appointed, also for the purposes of Article 1704 (mandato con rappresentanza) of the Italian Civil
Code, the Security Agent to act as its agent and mandatario con rappresentanza under the Intercreditor
Agreement and the relevant security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security
Documents. Furthermore, each holder will have deemed to have appointed the Security Agent as
_mandatario con rappresentanza pursuant to article 1704 of the Italian Civil Code and as representative_
(rappresentante) pursuant to article 2414-bis of the Italian Civil Code to act on its behalf. The trustee
and the holders of the Existing Notes, creditors under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the


-----

counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral, the lender under the Existing Term
Loan and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized
the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are
specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such
Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each
relevant Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to
be executed by the Security Agent in its name and on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the
Holders) to enter into a creditor accession undertaking in respect of the Intercreditor Agreement to give
effect to the provisions described in the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed
to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in

the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security
Documents;

(2) authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee, as applicable, to act in its name and on its behalf

to enter into the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and to be bound thereby
and to perform their respective obligations and exercise their respective rights thereunder in
accordance therewith;

(3) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional

Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;

(4) agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as representative

(rappresentante) of the noteholders for the purposes of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the
Italian Civil Code;

(5) agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the Transaction Security in

accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Indenture and the Security Documents; and

(6) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and

comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents.

See the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security
_Interests—The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than_
_directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be_
_restricted by local law.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) entered into as described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor
_Agreements.”_


-----

**_Release of Liens_**

The Third Party Security Provider, the Issuer and the Issuer’s Subsidiaries (as applicable) will be
entitled to release the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) any Person that is not the

Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the_
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary
_Stock” and is otherwise not prohibited under the Indenture or (b) to any Restricted Subsidiary;_
_provided that this clause (1)(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock,_
obligations under proceeds loans owed to the Issuer, or accounts receivable (including
intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except, in
the case of accounts receivable, to a Receivables Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and
assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in favor of the Notes following
such transfer, sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the

Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal

defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—
_Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in

accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and
assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) upon the contribution of any claim of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, which is subject

to a Lien, to the equity of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that such
contribution is made in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) upon the Engineering Merger, as described under the fifth paragraph under “—Security—

_General,” with respect to each of (a) the Security Interests in the Issuer’s receivables under the_
Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loan I, (b) the Security Interest over the share
capital of the Company or the Security Interest over the share capital of the Issuer, as applicable
and upon the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, as described under the sixth paragraph under
“—Security—General,” with respect to each of (a) the Security Interests in the receivables
under the Overlord Funding Loan II and (b) the Security Interest over the share capital of
Overlord Bidco;

(8) upon achievement of the conditions described under “—Certain Covenants—Suspension of

_Covenants and Release of Security Interests on Achievement of Investment Grade Status”; or_

(9) as otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including in connection
with an IPO pushdown as described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement—Required Consents—Provisions Following an IPO”) and (b) as may be_
permitted under “—Certain Covenants— Impairment of Security Interest.”


-----

At the request and expense of the Issuer or the relevant pledgor, the Security Agent and, to the extent
required or necessary, the Trustee will take all reasonably necessary action required to effectuate any
release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of
the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant
Security Document, subject to customary protections and indemnification, if applicable. Each of the
releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or
any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security
Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and
Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of
the Security Interests has occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of registered notes in global form without interest coupons, will
be offered and sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act
(“Regulation S”) and will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the the “Global Notes”). The Global Note will, on the Issue Date, be
deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions
on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Notice
_to Investors.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or_
participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary
procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream
and their respective participants.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the
Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required
by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry
Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set
forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be
subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and
described more fully under “Notice to Investors.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in
principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer
or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things,
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account
of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and
opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or
exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with
such transfer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat
the registered Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.


-----

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are expected to be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for the
purposes of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain
_Definitions— Unrestricted Subsidiary,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as_
“Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive
covenants in the Indenture.

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

On, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering, the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement provide (and the Indenture and the Notes shall be subject to such provisions) that the Issuer
or its successor shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent) that
the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
and the Security Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in such notice) as
described in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Required
_Consents—Provisions Following an IPO.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required (at the_
expense of the Issuer) to enter into any amendment to the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security Documents required by the Issuer and/or take
such other action as is required by the Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters
contemplated by this paragraph; _provided that such amendment will not impose any personal_
obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent,
as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or
the Security Agent under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security Interests—
_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral_
_securing the Notes will be released automatically without your consent or the Trustee or the Security_
_Agent obtaining your further consent.”_

**The Overlord Funding Loans**

On September 19, 2022, in order to transfer the proceeds from the Bridge Term Facility and the
Offering, as applicable, from the Issuer to Overlord Bidco to be used in connection with the
Transactions, we entered into the following intercompany funding loan agreements: (i) a first
intercompany loan agreement by and between the Issuer, as lender, and the Company, as borrower,
providing for an aggregate principal amount of up to €385 million (the “Overlord Funding Loan I”), all
of which was borrowed in connection with the Be Acquisition and is currently outstanding, and (ii) a
second back-to-back intercompany loan agreement entered by and between the Company, as lender,
and Overlord Bidco, as borrower, providing for an aggregate principal amount of up to €385 million
(the “Overlord Funding Loan II” and, together with the Overlord Funding Loan I, collectively, the
“Overlord Funding Loans”), all of which was borrowed in connection with the Be Acquisition and is
currently outstanding. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Overlord Funding Loans
“and “Summary—The Transactions.”

Subject to certain significant exceptions, the Overlord Funding Loans documentation prohibits the
repayment, reduction, extinction or equitization of the Overlord Funding Loans. Such exceptions
include, but are not limited to (a) the repayment thereof to enable the Issuer to make payments of
principal and interest under the Existing Notes, the Existing Term Loan and the Notes, and (b) upon
request of the relevant lender under the respective Overlord Funding Loans, the partial repayment
thereof in an amount not exceeding €50.0 million during the tenor of the relevant Overlord Funding
Loan. Pursuant to these exceptions, the Issuer may, among other things, cause directly or indirectly the
reduction and/or cancellation of either or both of the Overlord Funding Loans in the event of any
mandatory or optional redemption of the Existing Notes at final maturity or prior thereto, which would
reduce the amounts recoverable for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes under the Guarantees granted
by the Company and/or Overlord Bidco, as applicable, in respect of the Notes offered hereby and the


-----

security interests over the receivables in respect of the Overlord Funding Loans, the value of which may
reduce to zero in certain circumstances. Moreover, the Indenture will not include any restrictions on the
Issuer or the Company to amend the Overlord Funding Loans documentation, including to permit the
repayment of the Overlord Funding Loans in order to allow the Issuer to discharge other debt secured
by the Collateral. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Security
_Interests—The principal amount of the Existing Funding Loan and the Overlord Funding Loans_
_forming part of the Collateral may be less than anticipated as a result of prepayments of certain_
_indebtedness of the Group prior to the maturity date of the Notes.” Upon completion of the Engineering_
Merger, the security interests in the Overlord Funding Loan I will automatically cease to exist, while
the security interests in the Overlord Funding Loan II will remain in place, until the date of the
Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, at which point the security interests in the Overlord Funding Loan
II will also automatically cease to exist. See “—Security—Release of Liens.”

**The Existing Funding Loan**

On July 23, 2020, the Issuer entered into the Existing Funding Loan (as amended on October 7, 2020),
a portion of the proceeds of which was used by the Company (together with certain cash available on
the Company’s balance sheet) to refinance certain indebtedness of the Company in connection with the
Engineering Acquisition. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the aggregate principal amount
of the Existing Funding Loan is approximately €114.4 million, which is significantly lower than the
aggregate principal amounts of the Notes offered hereby.

Subject to certain significant exceptions, the Existing Funding Loan documentation prohibits the
repayment, reduction, extinction or equitization of the Existing Funding Loan. Such exceptions include,
but are not limited to, the repayment of the Existing Funding Loan to enable the Issuer to make payments
of principal and interest on the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan and, upon request of the
Issuer, the partial repayment of the Existing Funding Loan in an amount not exceeding €15.0 million
during the tenor of the Existing Funding Loan. The Existing Indenture does not, and the Indenture will
not include any restrictions on the Issuer or the Company to amend the Existing Funding Loan
documentation, including to permit the repayment of the Existing Funding Loan in order to allow the
Issuer to discharge other debt secured by the Collateral. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes,
_the Guarantee and the Security Interests—The principal amount of the Existing Funding Loan forming_
_part of the Collateral may be less than anticipated as a result of prepayments of certain indebtedness_
_of the Group prior to the maturity date of the Notes.” Upon completion of the Engineering Merger, the_
security interests in the Existing Funding Loan will automatically cease to exist. See “—Security—
_Release of Liens.”_

**The Engineering Merger**

The Engineering Merger was resolved upon by the board of directors of the Issuer on February 22, 2023
and by the board of directors the Company on February 23, 2023, and then resolved upon by the
respective extraordinary shareholders’ meetings on March 9, 2023.We currently expect to complete the
Engineering Merger in the first half of 2023, with retroactive effect (from a tax and accounting
standpoint) from January 1, 2023. The Engineering Merger is subject to certain conditions and may not
be completed within the envisaged timeframe or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes,
_the Guarantees and the Security Interests—We may be unable to complete the Engineering Merger_
_within the anticipated time frame, or at all.”_

Upon consummation of the Engineering Merger and the granting of the Post-Engineering Merger
Collateral, certain of the security granted under the Initial Collateral and, to the extent the Engineering
Merger occurs prior to the date on which the Post-Issue Date Collateral is granted, the Post-Issue Date
Collateral will cease to exist by operation of law and, within ten Business Days from (and excluding)
the Engineering Merger Date, the Existing Notes and the Notes will be secured by security interests in
the Post-Engineering Merger Collateral. See “—Security.”


-----

See “Description of the Notes—Notes Guarantees,” “Description of the Notes—Security,” “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Once granted, the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_
_laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” and “Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and the Security Interests.”_

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to     , 2025, the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at its option,
upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of such Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest on
the Notes redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date and Additional Amounts, if any.

At any time and from time to time prior to    , 2025, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions
redeem, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” during each calendar year up to 10%
of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional
Notes), at a redemption price of 103% of the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus accrued
and unpaid interest on the Notes redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date and Additional
Amounts, if any.

At any time and from time to time prior to    , 2025, the Issuer may redeem Notes, upon notice as
described under “—Selection and Notice,” with the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer from any
Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to      % of the principal amount of the Notes so
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption
date and Additional Amounts, if any, in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to
exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal
amount of any Additional Notes); provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related

Equity Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including the original

principal amount of any Additional Notes) issued under the Indenture remains outstanding
immediately after each such redemption (excluding Notes held by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries and unless all of the other Notes are otherwise redeemed substantially
concurrently therewith).

At any time and from time to time on or after    , 2025, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole
or in part, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to the
percentage of principal amount of the Notes so redeemed set forth below plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date and Additional
Amounts, if any, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on      of the year indicated
below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**

2025 .......................................................................................................................... %

2026 .......................................................................................................................... %

2027 and thereafter .................................................................................................. 100.000%

**_General_**

Subject to compliance with the covenants contained herein, the Issuer and its affiliates may at any time
and from time to time purchase Notes. Any such purchases may be made through open market or
privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers


-----

or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as the Issuer or any
such affiliates may determine, and the amounts purchased may be material.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, if and for so long as the Notes are listed on
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, inform
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is
registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Notes, any such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be
subject to one or more conditions precedent. In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, in the Issuer’s discretion,
the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied
(provided, however, that, in any case, such redemption date shall be no more than 60 days from the date
on which such notice is first given), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded
in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by
the redemption date so delayed.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of Notes, if Holders
of Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes of such
series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third
party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes of such series validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender
offer expiration date, to redeem the Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in
part following such purchase at a price equal to the price (excluding any early tender fee) offered to
each other Holder of Notes of such series in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the
tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption
date.

**Sinking Fund**

Other than in an event of a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer is not required to make mandatory
redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain
circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under “—Change of
_Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.”_

**Redemption at Maturity**

On, 2028, the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased
and cancelled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the redemption date.

**Selection and Notice**

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but
not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address
of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered
electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection


-----

with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. Notice of any redemption
of the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a transaction (including
an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other transaction) and any
redemption notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent,
including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so
subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such
condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be
delayed until such time (provided, however, that any redemption date shall not be more than 60 days
after the date of the notice of redemption) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such
redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all
such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so
delayed. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and
performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another
Person. If and or so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish such notice of redemption on the
website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com).

If less than all of the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar
(as applicable) will select Notes of the applicable series for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the
case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form,” based on a
method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection of the applicable series in accordance with
the procedures of the relevant clearing system), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock
exchange, clearing system or depositary requirements. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the
Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state
the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note,
a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive
Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of
the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be
made on such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest
ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at its discretion, at any time upon giving not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable)
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and all Additional Amounts
(as defined below under “Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax
Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good
faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated

thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation

of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or
order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice or published
guidance) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be,
required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes or any Notes Guarantee (but, in the case


-----

of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or
another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts),
and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable).
Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date
(or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after
the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such
time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis
to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be
given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such
payment of Additional Amounts and unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such
Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption
of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer or successor Person, as applicable, will deliver to the
Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth
a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied
and that the relevant Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable
measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing and
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that
the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax
Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as
sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without liability or
further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity)
(each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be
made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless
the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding
for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note is made, or any political

subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax, by or on
behalf of any Payor or the Paying Agent; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or

otherwise or considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a
“Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor
or the Paying Agent with respect to any Note or any Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal,
redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts, after
such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional
Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such
payments on any such Note or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
_provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former

connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder


-----

or the beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner is an estate, nominee,
trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or
resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in,
or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case,
any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the
receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture
or a Notes Guarantee; or

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial

owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor or any other person
through whom payment can be made addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least
30 days before any such withholding or deduction is payable), to provide certification,
information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of
the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any
other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty,
regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the
Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so; or

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note

for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is
required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to
the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts
had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period); or

(4) any Taxes that are payable other than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the

principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes or with respect to any Notes
Guarantee; or

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other

governmental charge; or

(6) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are on account of imposta sostitutiva pursuant to Italian

Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996, as amended or supplemented from time to time
(“Legislative Decree No. 239”) and pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November
21, 1997, unless the procedures required under Legislative Decree No. 239 in order to benefit
from an exemption from _imposta sostitutiva have not been complied with due to actions or_
omissions of the Issuer or its agents; or

(7) any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections
1471 through 1474 of the Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (or, in each case, any amended
or successor version that is substantively comparable), any current or future regulations or
agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or any law implementing an
intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary
or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would
not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner
held such Notes directly.


-----

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use
reasonable efforts to obtain and provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any
Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if,
notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not
available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably
practicable to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders
upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. The Payor will
attach to each such certified copy or other evidence of such payments a certificate stating that the
amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy or other evidence was paid in connection
with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver
to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the
amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to
pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay
Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor
may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall be
entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any
context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee, such

reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse the Holders for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court
or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with
respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any
related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the
execution, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any
Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in
each case, in connection with a transfer of the Notes after this offering and limited, solely to the extent
of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or
interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses
(1) through (3) and (5) through (7) above).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which
any successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for
tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes
(or any Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing
authority or agency thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “—
_Change of Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part_
(equal to €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Notes of €100,000
or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in
cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be
obligated to repurchase Notes as described under this heading “—Change of Control,” in the event and
to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes and given notice
of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption
have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice of
redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have
been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer
will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the
Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right

to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in
cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control
_Payment”);_

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from

the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease

to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control
Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue
interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that

constitute the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder

must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change

of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will,
to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of

Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of

all Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate

principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change
of Control Offer;


-----

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an authenticating

agent) the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof
that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant

Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly, at the cost of the
Issuer, mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment
for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly
authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered
Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the
Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notices relating to the Change of
Control Offer on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com).

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase
Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the
Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer
and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a
definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control
Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to
this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the
Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC
indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer
satisfies certain conditions

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be
limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of
Control would require the Issuer to make (x) a change of control offer under the Existing Indenture and
(y) a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
and the Existing Term Loan Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of
control under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility or the Existing Term Loan and require a mandatory
prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreements may not constitute a Change of Control under the
Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions
of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be
repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require
the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such
Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase


-----

on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited
by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources and whether the Restricted Subsidiaries are permitted
to distribute funds to the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
_Guarantee and the Security Interests—The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a_
_change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer_
_may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain_
_holders do not consent to the tender” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Capital Structure—The_
_Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and prior to the_
_Engineering Merger will depend exclusively on cash from the operating companies of the Group to be_
_able to make payments on the Notes.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions,
of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to
specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether
a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property and assets
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of
Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders
of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the date of such Incurrence, after giving _pro_
_forma effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds_
thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; provided
that the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to this paragraph
by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors may not cause the Non Guarantor Debt Cap to be
exceeded.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility

(including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder)
in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding the greater of
€256.9 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(2)

(a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted
to be Incurred by another provision of this covenant; provided that if the Indebtedness
being guaranteed is subordinated or pari passu with a Notes Guarantee, then the
Guarantee of such Indebtedness shall be subordinated or pari passu to the same extent
as the Indebtedness being guaranteed; or


-----

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness
arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of
such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a

Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided,
_however, that:_

(a) if the Issuer or a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Indebtedness and the obligee is not
the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is unsecured and, only to the extent legally
permitted (the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all
procedures required in the reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or
obligor to protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in
connection with the subordination of such Indebtedness), it is expressly subordinated to
the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Notes or the
applicable Notes Guarantee, as applicable, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in
any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary and any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person
other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary shall be deemed, in each case, to
constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4)

(a) Indebtedness represented by (i) the Existing Notes (other than any additional Existing
Notes issued after the Issue Date) and the Guarantees of the Existing Notes, the Existing
Term Loan and the Guarantees thereof, the Notes (other than any Additional Notes)
and the Notes Guarantees, and (ii) any “parallel debt” obligations related to the Notes,
the Existing Notes and the Existing Term Loan under the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as well “parallel debt” obligations related to
any other Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the Indenture;

(b) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in clause
(4)(a), this clause (4)(b), clause 4(c) and clause (5)(II) of this paragraph or Incurred
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant;

(c) an amount equal to any Indebtedness of the Group outstanding, committed or available
for borrowing or utilization as in effect as of the Issue Date after giving _pro forma_
effect to the Transactions (other than Indebtedness (x) outstanding on the Issue Date
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility (if any) and (y) Incurred or outstanding
on the Issue Date pursuant to clause (4)(a) of this paragraph); and

(d) Indebtedness Incurred in respect of Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (a) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a

Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with
(including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary or (b) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to
consummate a transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which (i) any Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or is otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
or (ii) any assets are acquired and related liabilities are assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary; provided that Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (5) is in an aggregate


-----

amount then outstanding not to exceed (I) the greater of €51.4 million and 20% of Consolidated
EBITDA, plus (II) unlimited additional Indebtedness to the extent that after giving pro forma
effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness,
either (A) the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant
to the first paragraph of this covenant or (B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer
would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other
transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness;

(6) Indebtedness in respect of Hedging Obligations not for speculative purposes (as determined in

good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness consisting of (a) Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase

Money Obligations or other financings, Incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of
the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used
or useful in a Similar Business or Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase,
lease, rental or cost of design, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or
personal) or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct
purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness
which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness or reimburses amounts used for such
purposes, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the
principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7)(a) and then
outstanding, does not exceed at any time outstanding the greater of €77.0 million and 30% of
Consolidated EBITDA; provided that such Indebtedness exists on the date of such purchase,
lease, rental or improvement or is created within 365 days thereafter; or (b) Indebtedness in
respect of Sale and Leaseback Transactions and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces,
refunds or reimburses such Indebtedness;

(15) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to factoring financings, securitizations, asset-backed

loans and financings (howsoever described or structured), receivables financings, reverse
factoring financings or similar arrangements, in each case, that are either: (a) settlement or
ordinary course funding facilities (whether recourse or non-recourse); (b) not recourse to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary other than a Securitization Subsidiary (except to the extent
customary in the good faith determination of the Issuer for such type of arrangement or except
for Standard Securitization Undertakings); or (c) not in excess of the greater of €38.5 million
and 15% of Consolidated EBITDA at any time outstanding.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (2) below, in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one

of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the
Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of
Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one
(or more, if applicable) of the clauses of the first or second paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness Incurred under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility shall be deemed Incurred

under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and may not be reclassified;

(3) the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to any provision of this covenant or

secured pursuant to the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Liens” shall be deemed to
include all amounts necessary to renew, refund, redeem, refinance, replace, restructure, defease
or discharge any such Indebtedness Incurred and/or secured pursuant to such provisions,
including after giving effect to additional Indebtedness in an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premia and other costs and expenses Incurred in
connection with such renewal, refund, redemption, refinancing, replacement, restructuring,
defeasance or discharge. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant or any provision
of the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on Liens,” the maximum amount that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur and/or secure pursuant to this covenant and/or the covenant
set forth in “—Limitation on Liens” shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to such
Incurrence or grant of Lien, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the amount of
Consolidated EBITDA (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness and such Lien will
be permitted to be refinanced or replaced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such
refinancing or replacement, such excess will continue);

(4) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar

instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments

are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause
(1), (5), (7), (11), (12), (13) or (14) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above
and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other
Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;


-----

(6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or

Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(7) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one

provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and
in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will

be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS;

(9) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or

amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness (including interest paid in kind), the payment of dividends in the form of
additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of
commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be
deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant, nor to be the
Incurrence of a Lien under the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on Liens”; provided that the
Lien securing such originally Incurred Preferred Stock or Indebtedness was secured in
accordance with the Indenture. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall
be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue
discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other
Indebtedness; and

(10) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases

commitments under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue
Indebtedness or commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (29) of the definition of
“Permitted Liens” or any Permitted Collateral Lien, the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all
purposes under the Indenture, including for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, or use of clauses (1) through (15) of the preceding paragraph (if any) for borrowings
and re borrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the
date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming
that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as applicable,
test or other provision of the Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any
borrowing or re borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant and under the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Liens” irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or
other provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or re borrowing (or issuance or
creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount
permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the
“Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, Consolidated Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, or other provision of the Indenture, and, to the extent the usage of clauses (1)
through (15) of the preceding paragraph (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding
under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any
such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Issuer may revoke such
determination at any time and from time to time.


-----

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant)._

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the euro equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred
(whichever yields the lower euro equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving
credit facility; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness_
denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro
denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such refinancing, such euro denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount
set forth in clause (2) of the definition of “Refinancing Indebtedness”; (b) the euro equivalent of the
principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on
the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is
denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro)
covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed
in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to
the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of
such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of the

to the equity of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any form or otherwise
received (including by way of Indebtedness) by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

-----

in subclause (x) above are contributed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary in the
form of Indebtedness, there shall be no double counting of interest paid on such
Indebtedness and any dividends or distributions payable to the relevant Parent to fund
interest payments in respect of Indebtedness of such Parent);

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Issuer or any

repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of
satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due
within one year of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other

(including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after
that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any
Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not
constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens
if the Notes and all payments due under the Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with, or
prior to (in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness), the Indebtedness secured by
such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or
asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as
set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens” or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.


-----

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased
Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase
in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted
value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and
increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange
rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing such Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay

any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or with
respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating_
distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y)
the subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or
advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or
restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Existing

Revolving Credit Facility under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the
Existing Term Loan under the Existing Term Loan Agreement), including in each case the
Guarantees thereof, (b) the Existing Indenture, the Existing Notes (including the Guarantees
thereof), the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Documents or the transaction security documents relating to the Existing Notes, the
Existing Term Loan and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, or (c) any other agreement or
instrument with respect to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, in effect at
or entered into on the Issue Date after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating

to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which
such Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than
Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of
the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to
which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged,
consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) and
outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is
the Successor Issuer (as defined below), the Successor Issuer or the Successor Guarantor (each
as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or
instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the


-----

Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Issuer or the
Successor Guarantor;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing

of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument
referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or
contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are (i) no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than
the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to
which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the Issuer) or (ii)
customary in comparable financings and where, in the case of this sub clause (ii), the Issuer
determines at the time of Incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or
restrictions would not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make
principal or interest payments on the Notes (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or a member of senior management of the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment
or transfer of any lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under
the Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
permitted under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict
the transfer of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or
other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set
forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease

Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or
restrictions on the property so acquired in the nature of clause (c) of this paragraph, or any
encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on
the distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property

or assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or
disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of
such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements

and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable

rule, regulation, licensing requirement or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers

under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction in respect of Hedging Obligations;


-----

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a)

relating to any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to
the provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole
are not materially less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Term Loan
Agreement, the Existing Indenture, the Existing Notes, the Notes or the Indenture, together with
the Security Documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as
in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the Issuer) or (b)
constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables

Financing or Settlement Obligations that, in good faith determination of the Board of Directors
or a member of senior management of the Issuer are customarily Incurred in connection with a
Qualified Receivables Financing or Settlement Obligations and that are necessary or advisable
to effect such Qualified Receivables Financing or Settlement Obligations; or

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—

_Limitation on Liens.”_

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition

is not less than the fair market value of the Capital Stock, property or other assets subject to
such Asset Disposition (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of Directors); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of

such Asset Disposition consists of:

(a) cash (including any Net Available Cash received from the conversion within 180 days
of such Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in
consideration of such Asset Disposition);

(b) Cash Equivalents;

(c) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Issuer’s or a
Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the date
of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other
than Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries remains obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y)
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness and
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) that is no longer a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Issuer and each other
Restricted Subsidiary is released from any Guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result
of such Asset Disposition;

(d) Replacement Assets;

(e) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the second
paragraph of this covenant;


-----

(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from
Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that
such Indebtedness (i) has been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor,
and (ii) is not Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(g) any Designated Non Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any
one time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €51.4 million and 20% of
Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of each issue of Designated Non
Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value); or

(h) a combination of the consideration specified in sub clauses (a) through (g) of this clause
(2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash
of the Asset Disposition, within 365 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset
Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as applicable, to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second

paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”; (ii) unless included
in the preceding clause (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (a) the Notes (including, in
each case, through open market purchases, tender offers and other privately negotiated
transactions); (b) the Existing Notes (including, in each case, through open market purchases,
tender offers and other privately negotiated transactions), at a price of no more than the higher
of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Existing Notes and (ii) the applicable redemption
price as of the date of any such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; (c)
Indebtedness (other than the Existing Notes, the Notes, Subordinated Indebtedness or
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) that is secured by a Lien on the
Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Existing Notes and the Notes (including, but not limited
to, Indebtedness Incurred under the Existing Term Loan and Indebtedness that, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement has priority in respect of
the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral) at a price of no more than 100% of the
principal amount of such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date
of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or
redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness
that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than
Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary) and at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such
applicable Indebtedness, _plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment,_
repayment, purchase or redemption; provided, however, that in connection with the
prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness (other than the Notes or any revolving
Indebtedness (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility)), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause
the related commitments (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so
prepaid, repaid or purchased;

(2) purchase Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders, in each case, at a purchase price in cash

equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon
and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right
of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date); provided, however, that to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has


-----

elected to purchase any amount of Notes at a price not less than par, to the extent relevant
Holders elect not to tender their Notes for such purchase, the Issuer will be deemed to have
applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered, and such amount
shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds;

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business,

if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or

useful in a Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clauses (1)

through (6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that a binding commitment
shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such
commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is consummated and (y)
the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period, if the investment
has not been consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess
_Proceeds.” Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily_
reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner that is
not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366th day (or the 546th day, if a binding commitment as described in clause (8) above has been
entered into) after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of €64.2 million and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA,
the Issuer will be required within ten Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”)
to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders or lenders of other outstanding Pari Passu
Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu
Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess
Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of (x) the Notes, in an amount equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes and (y) any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in an amount not exceeding 100% of
the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as
applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof; provided that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may elect, in its sole
discretion, to make an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the end of the 365-day period.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the
Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other
covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any
Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or
lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated
among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the
aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of
calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness


-----

shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their euro equivalent determined as
of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below).
Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in
a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof
payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such
Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net
Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less
than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later
than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset
_Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent_
it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset
_Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly_
tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition
Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer
Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in
accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will
promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition
Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the
Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for
purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the
Trustee (or an authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will
authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder,
in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; _provided that each_
such new Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Note not
so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the
Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to
the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with
provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such
compliance. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of
the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange
of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or
series of related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of
the greater of €25.7 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, unless:


-----

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the

Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement
providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an
Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of

€64.2 million and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of
related transactions have been approved or ratified by a resolution of the majority of the
members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with
clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—

_Limitation on Restricted Payments” (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the third_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) and any
agreement related to such Restricted Payments or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Funding, Capital Stock, options, other equity

related investments or other warrants or securities or rights to purchase Capital Stock, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or
entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other
compensation arrangements, restricted stock plans, long term incentive plans, stock
appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans
(including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings
or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers,
employees, directors or consultants approved or ratified by the Board of Directors of the Issuer;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto, or Parent

Expenses;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or with an entity

that is not an Affiliate that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or
between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or any Receivables Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities

and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers,
consultants or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent (whether
directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such
directors, officers or employees);

(6) (i)the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary under

the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and any payments pursuant to or
for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as
these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended,
renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this
covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect, and
(ii) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangement

pursuant to which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is required or permitted to file a
consolidated tax return, or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax,
accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of business;


-----

_provided that payments under such Tax Sharing Agreement shall not exceed, and shall not be_
duplicative of, the amounts described under clause (7) of the definition of “Parent Expenses”;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services,

including in respect of Settlement Obligations, in each case, in the ordinary course of business,
which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination
of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or
are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time
from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of

the Issuer (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) or an Associate or similar entity, including
any joint venture, that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate
or similar entity;

(10) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated

Preference Shares) of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital
Stock, or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial
terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of the members
of the Board of Directors in their reasonable determination and any amendment, waiver or other
transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other
provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, as applicable;

(11) without duplication of the payments referred to under item 6 of the definition of

“Parent Expenses,” (a) payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted
Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent) of annual management,
consulting, monitoring, transaction or advisory and other fees (including termination fees),
indemnities and expenses in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of €12.9 million and
5% of Consolidated EBITDA per annum (with any amount unused in any calendar year being
carried forward to the next succeeding calendar year) and, in each case, related expenses; and
(b) customary payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder
(whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent) for financial advisory, financing,
underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities,
including in connection with loans, capital market transactions, acquisitions or divestitures, and
payments related to the reimbursement of reasonable out of pocket expenses Incurred by a
Permitted Holder in connection with its Investment in the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
which payments (or agreements providing for such payments) in respect of this clause (11)(b)
are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith;

(12) any transactions in respect of which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers a

written opinion (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) to the Trustee
from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (ii) on terms not less favorable than
might have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s length basis
from a Person who is not an Affiliate;

(13) any contribution to the equity of the Issuer in exchange for Capital Stock (other than

Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock) or any investments by any of the Permitted Holders in
securities of any Restricted Subsidiary (and the payment of reasonable out of pocket expenses
of the Permitted Holders in connection therewith);

(14) pledges of Capital Stock of Unrestricted Subsidiaries;


-----

(15) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing or Settlement

Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, so long as (i) the investment complies with clause (1) of the
preceding paragraph, (ii) non Affiliates were also offered the opportunity to invest in such
Indebtedness or Preferred Stock on the same or more favorable terms and (iii) in the case of
securities, the investment constitutes less than 5% of the issue amount of such securities, and
transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of Indebtedness or Preferred
Stock of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, so long as such transaction is with all holders of
such class (and there are such non Affiliate holders) and such Affiliates are treated no more
favorably than all other holders of such class generally.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of each of the Issuer’s fiscal years, annual reports containing: (a)

the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end of the most recent two fiscal
years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for

financial statements; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information
of the Issuer together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal

provided in a previous report pursuant to clause 2(b) or (2)(c) below); provided that such pro
_forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable_
expense or burden, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition,

consolidated basis; provided that the information described in clauses (d), (e) and (f) may be
provided in the footnotes to the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days after the end of each of the Issuer’s first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year,

quarterly financial statements containing the following information: (a) the Issuer’s unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed
statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period ending on
the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited _pro forma income statement and balance sheet_
information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently
completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates; provided that such pro forma
financial information will be _provided only to the extent available without unreasonable_
expense or burden, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition,
acquired company financial information; and (c) an operating and financial review of the
unaudited financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any

acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in the chief executive
officer or chief financial officer at the Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer, a report
containing a description of such event.


-----

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act
for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Issuer will also post
such report on the Issuer’s website. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF thereof and to the extent that
the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, copies of all reports required
by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant will also be posted to the website of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date
of such report or financial statement and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except, in each
case, as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth
in clauses (1) and (2) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis
that applied to such periods. Except as provided below, no report need include separate financial
statements for the Issuer or any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results
of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering
Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation
to U.S. GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity
or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s Consolidated EBITDA
for the Relevant Testing Period after giving effect to such transaction in the case of an acquisition and
prior to giving effect to such transaction in the case of a disposition.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary
of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this
“—Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial
statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Issuer or any Parent becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues
to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the
Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer)
the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of
U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures),
for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information,
documents and other reports that the Issuer or such Parent, as applicable, is, or would be, required to
file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).

The Issuer may comply with the requirements of clauses (1) and (2) of this covenant by providing any
report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent of the Issuer so long as such reports (if an
annual or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of
clause (1) and (2) of this covenant as if references to the Issuer therein were references to such Parent
and (b) include condensed consolidated financial information together with separate columns for: (i)
such Parent; (ii) the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other
Subsidiaries of the Issuer on a combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total
consolidated amounts. For purposes of this covenant and any determination or calculation to be made
under the Indenture, the Issuer may use financial statements of a predecessor of the Issuer for reporting
or making calculations with respect to periods commencing prior to the Issue Date. Upon complying


-----

with the foregoing requirements in this paragraph, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Additionally, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the Issuer or any Parent or
IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the
equivalent regulated markets of the Milan Stock Exchange, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the Paris
Stock Exchange or another internationally recognized stock exchange (any of the foregoing, an
“International Exchange”), and the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and
disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the International
Exchange, for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is, or would be,
required to file with the International Exchange. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and
provided, that such requirements require the Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual
reports, information, documents and other reports with such International Exchange, the Issuer will be
deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “—Reports”
covenant is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute
constructive notice of any information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of
its covenants under the Indenture.

All reports provided pursuant to this “—Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey,
transfer, lease, sell or otherwise dispose all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially
as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person (other than in
connection with the Engineering Merger or the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, neither of which
shall be restricted or prohibited by this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant), unless:

(1) the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor

_Issuer”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the_
European Union, the United Kingdom, any State of the United States of America or the District
of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor
Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and
delivered to the Trustee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of
the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture, and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents,
as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes

an obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of
such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time
of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer,

as applicable, would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to
the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect
to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer, as applicable, shall have delivered to the Trustee (a) an

Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation,


-----

merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the terms of the
Indenture and (b) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that in the case of the Successor Issuer,
such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a
legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion
of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which
properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be
the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the
predecessor Person will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

_Guarantors_

No Guarantor of the Notes (other than (i) a Guarantor whose Notes Guarantee is to be released in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement substantially concurrently
with such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition or
(ii) with respect to Overlord Bidco, in connection with the Engineering-Overlord Bidco Merger, or,
with respect to Engineering, in connection with the Engineering Merger) will, directly or indirectly,
consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease, sell or otherwise dispose of
all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series
of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a

Guarantor substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer, lease, sell or other disposition;

(2) (a) either (x) the Issuer or a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving

or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Notes
Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations of the Guarantor under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents,
as applicable (such resulting, surviving or transferee Person (other than the Issuer), the
“Successor Guarantor”); and (b) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default
or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or

(3) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or

merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted
by the Indenture.

The provisions set forth in this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not
apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating with,
merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer,
a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor
from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or a


-----

Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of any Guarantor into the Issuer; provided that, if the Issuer
is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The
_Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; (iv) the Engineering Merger; (v) the Engineering-Overlord_
Bidco Merger and (vi) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an
Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity,
reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided,
_however, that clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clauses (1) through (3) under the_
heading “—Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction.

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed to agree, for the
purposes of Section 2503-bis (et seq.) of the Italian Civil Code, to the consummation of the Engineering
Merger and, in the event that the Company is the Successor Issuer (or otherwise the successor company
to the Issuer) after giving effect to the Engineering Merger, the assumption by MergerCo of all
obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
relevant Security Documents, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, upon completion of the
Engineering Merger.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

Neither the Third Party Security Provider nor the Issuer shall, and the Issuer shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the
result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood,
subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for
the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and neither the Third Party Security Provider nor the Issuer
shall, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the
Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in
the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
any interest whatsoever in the Collateral, except that (i) the Third Party Security Provider, the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise
modify or replace any Security Documents for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii)
the Third Party Security Provider, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew,
restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents for the purposes
of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization, the Engineering Merger, the Engineering-Overlord Bidco
Merger, the Be-Be Opco Merger or a transaction not prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—
_Merger and Consolidation,” (iii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the_
Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to
cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein and (v) the Third Party
Security Provider, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the Security Interests in any
manner that does not adversely affect Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that in the
case of clause (i), (ii) or (v) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any
such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Security Agent, either (a) a solvency opinion, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor
confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (as applicable), after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
release, modification or replacement, (b) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the Issuer
or the relevant Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or
(c) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming
that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,


-----

supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security
Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are
valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or
at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, each of the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and
secured to its satisfaction) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the
Holders.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the
Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor Incurred pursuant to a Credit Facility (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Term Loan) or any Public
Debt of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor of the
Notes within 30 days from the date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and
delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which
such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee; _provided, however, that such Restricted_
Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the
Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee would be inconsistent with the Agreed Security Principles. At the
option of the Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on such Guarantor’s liability to the
extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—The
_Notes Guarantees—Notes Guarantees Release.” A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be_
released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release either (1) there is no Indebtedness of
such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been
Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor or
(2) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and
which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if
such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent
shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee
in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being
indemnified and secured to its satisfaction.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of
each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security_
_Interests.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the
Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries of any (x) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or clause (1), (4), (5), (6), (7) (other
than with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations), (11) or (12) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of
Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly


-----

authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a
restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially
the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders),
including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and
release of the Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose
any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security
Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or
Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any
Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency
of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement
that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement
(including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3)
add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable
pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7)
amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the
terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the
Holders in any material respect. In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled
to request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security
Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders
of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise
permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers,” and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and
the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent,
adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the
Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; _provided, however, that such_
transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed
to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described
herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day
upon prior written request at our offices.

**_Suspension of Covenants and Release of Security Interests on Achievement of Investment Grade_**
**_Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on
that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade
Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions
will not apply to the Notes:


-----

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) the provisions of clause (3) of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—

_The Issuer”;_

(7) “—Impairment of Security Interest”;

(8) the second, third and fourth paragraphs of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary”; and

(9) “—Limitation on Activities of the Third Party Security Providers,”

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not
be applicable to the Issuer, the Third Party Security Provider (to the extent applicable) or the Restricted
Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of
any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension
Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default.
The covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the second, third and fourth
paragraphs of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” will be interpreted as if it has been in effect
since the date of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion
Date, all Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred during the continuance of
the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

Furthermore, (a) any transactions prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Affiliate
_Transactions” entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any_
continuance of a Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6)(ii) of the
second paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” and (b) any
encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in
clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any_
continuance of a Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the
second paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from
_Restricted Subsidiaries.”_

In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or
any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future
after the Reversion Date as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the
Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Reversion Date. The Trustee shall have no duty to
monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Notes
and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the
occurrence of the Reversion Date. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the
first paragraph under this caption (including the paragraph immediately following) have been satisfied,
provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants or the release
of the Security Interests in respect of the Notes described under this caption to be effective. The Trustee


-----

shall not be obliged to notify Holders of a Suspension Event or, if applicable, upon the occurrence of a
Reversion Date.

The Issuer will have the right on and from the date on which the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status
to release from time to time any of the property and other assets included in the Collateral from the
Liens securing the Notes upon the Issuer delivering to the Trustee and the Security Agent an Officer’s
Certificate identifying the Collateral to be released and certifying that (a) the Notes have achieved
Investment Grade Status, (b) no Default Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is
continuing and (c) such Collateral has been or, simultaneously with any release relating to the Notes,
will be, released under any other Pari Passu Indebtedness (other than the obligations under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, Hedging Obligations or other Indebtedness which is entitled to receive
proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes in a manner not materially less
favorable to the Holders than that accorded to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement). This shall be in addition to the Security Agent’s and the
Trustee’s entitlement to request and rely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each
certifying that such release complies with the Indenture.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve Investment Grade Status. There are also
circumstances other than the achievement of Investment Grade Status that would result in a release of
the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral. See “—Security—Release of Liens” and “—IPO Debt
_Pushdown.”_

**_Limitation on Activities of the Third Party Security Provider_**

The Third Party Security Provider shall not trade, carry on any business, own any assets or incur any
liabilities other than:

(1) the ownership of shares of the Issuer and any finance Subsidiary (provided that such finance

Subsidiary shall not trade, carry on any business, own any assets or incur any liabilities other
than those which the Third Party Security Provider is permitted under this covenant);

(2) making an Investment in the Issuer in the form of Subordinated Shareholder Funding, loans of

Indebtedness to the Issuer or purchases of Capital Stock of the Issuer or otherwise contributed
to the equity of the Issuer;

(3) the provision of holding company services substantially similar to those provided to the Group

prior to the Issue Date by the Company and the provision of other headquarters services,
administrative services (including treasury services, cash-pooling arrangements and group chief
financial officer functions), legal, accounting, marketing, procurement and management
services to its Subsidiaries of a type customarily provided by a holding company to its
Subsidiaries (including being actively involved in the management decisions of its Subsidiaries,
such as (i) issuing general strategic guidelines, (ii) providing guidance on extraordinary
transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, disposals of assets and investments and (iii)
monitoring the performance of its Subsidiaries) and the ownership of assets and the incurrence
of liabilities necessary to provide such services;

(4) (a) Incurring Indebtedness (including the Existing PIK Notes), Guarantees of Indebtedness and

Subordinated Shareholder Funding (including, in each case, activities reasonably incidental
thereto, including performance of the terms and conditions of such Indebtedness or
Subordinated Shareholder Funding, to the extent such activities are otherwise permissible under

**_Financial Calculations in Respect of Transactions_**

When calculating the satisfaction of, or availability under, any basket or ratio under the Indenture in
each case, in connection with any transaction (including, for the avoidance of doubt and without
limitation, any Incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness or Liens, the making of any Restricted
Payment, Permitted Payment or Investment, any Asset Disposition, any acquisition, disposition,
merger, joint venture, consolidation, amalgamation or other business combination, any transaction
requiring the testing of any basket based on the Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer and any other
similar transaction where there is a time difference between commitment and closing of Incurrence),
the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the
option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements (including any commitment letter subject to
full documentation) for such transaction are entered into, and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated
with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma provisions set
forth in the definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Leverage Ratio after giving
effect to such transaction and other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including
any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of
the applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction (and
not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio).

For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded or unsatisfied as a result of
fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in the Consolidated Net Income,
Consolidated EBITDA, Indebtedness, Senior Secured Indebtedness, Consolidated Leverage or cash and
Cash Equivalents of the Issuer or that arising from an asset or a target company subject to such
transaction) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant
transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or unsatisfied as a result
of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transaction is permitted hereunder
and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or
related transactions; provided, further that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the
time of entry into such definitive agreement (including any commitment letter subject to full
documentation), any such transactions (including any Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, Asset
Disposition or Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have
occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of
calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the
consummation of such transaction. The amount of cash or Cash Equivalents included in the calculation
of Consolidated Leverage or Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage shall be calculated after giving
effect to the relevant transactions on a _pro forma_ basis (including the expected sources and uses in
respect thereof). To the extent the date of determination of a basket or ratio is tested prior to the date of
consummation of a transaction, such basket or ratio shall be deemed utilized to the same extent until
the earlier of the date of consummation of such transaction or the date such transaction is terminated or
expires without consummation, except that in the case of an acquisition, merger or consolidation, any
calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes other than Incurrences of Indebtedness or Liens or
the making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition, merger or consolidation) shall not
reflect such transaction until it has been consummated.


-----

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and

payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under

the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required
repurchase, upon acceleration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or, solely in connection with the covenants described under “—Certain

_Covenants— Limitation on Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,”_
and “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Activities of the Third Party Security Provider,” the
Third Party Security Provider, to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders
of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with their respective other
agreements contained in the Indenture;

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there

may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money
borrowed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after
the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness
(“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”), and the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together_
with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been
a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €40
million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Third Party Security

Provider, the Issuer, a Significant Subsidiary or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken

together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €40 million
(exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for),
which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment
becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents with respect to Collateral having a fair

market value in excess of €10.0 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other
than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such
Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such Security
Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Third Party
Security Provider, the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary that has granted such Security


-----

Interest shall assert in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and
any such Default continues for ten days; and

(8) any Notes Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than

in accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid
or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its
obligations under its Notes Guarantee and any such Default continues for ten days.

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture
notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6) the Issuer does not cure such
default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt
of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the
Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and
payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due
and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of
Default described in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of
the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such
Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in
full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (i) the annulment of
the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction and (ii) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest
on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture
by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of
Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if
any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder (which may only be waived with the consent of
Holders holding 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the Indenture))
and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would
not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered
to the Trustee and, if requested, the Trustee has received, customary indemnification and/or security
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce
the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with
respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;


-----

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee

to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it against any

loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request

and the offer of such indemnity and/or security; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the

Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within
such 60 day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding
for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of
which a responsible officer of the Trustee is aware, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its
powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The
Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the
Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the
Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled
to customary indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against all losses, liabilities and
expenses (including legal fees) caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide
that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer,
the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the
Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on
any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding
notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days
after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date), an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default
that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days
after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute
certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will
also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply
with the time periods prescribed under “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any
notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon
the delivery of any such report required by such provision or notice or certificate, as applicable, even
though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be
possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such
circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity
to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions and to the provisions described in “—Meetings of Holders of Notes,” the
Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of Holders


-----

of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain
exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived under the Indenture
with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Notes); provided that if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect one series of
Notes then outstanding under the Indenture, only the consent of a majority in principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 75% of the then outstanding principal
amount of the Notes affected (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Notes), an amendment or waiver under the Indenture may not, with respect
to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or

modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any

Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the contractual right expressly set forth in the Indenture of any Holder of any outstanding

Note to bring suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal, interest or Additional
Amounts, if any, on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that

adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the
terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes
described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the Issuer or the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional
Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral or on the

Escrowed Proceeds other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or

interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of
acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of
such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the

Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’

consent described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the
Security Agent may under the Indenture amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:


-----

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any

Restricted Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender

any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders

or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in
any material respect under the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of

the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the

provision described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add_
security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination,
discharge or retaking of any Notes Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security
Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when
such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the
Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of

this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the
_Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Intercreditor_
Agreement, the Security Documents or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the

Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or
Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the
Trustee or the Security Agent to any Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security

interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders, the holders of the Existing
Notes, parties to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and/or parties to the Existing Term
Loan, in any property which is required by the Security Documents, the Existing Notes (as in
effect on the Issue Date) and/or the Existing Revolving Credit Facility (as in effect on the Issue
Date) and/or the Existing Term Loan (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged
or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent,
or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any
Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the provisions
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with; or

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—

_Certain Covenants— Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”_

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely absolutely
on such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of


-----

the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of
Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such
tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraph above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by subsections (3) and (6) in respect of providing for a Notes Guarantee, it shall only be
necessary for the supplemental indenture or Notes Guarantee of such additional Guarantor to be duly
authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other
amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer and
the Trustee.

The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to
Holders.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in
any direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be
disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the Notes
and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except
for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties,
immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and
obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments
held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security
Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the
defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of it and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain
_Covenants— Merger and Consolidation”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions_
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross
default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with
respect to Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision (other than
in respect of the Issuer) and the security default provision described under “—Events of Default”
(“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment
of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the
Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may
not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to
clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”), (4), (5) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events_
_of Default.”_

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee
for this purpose) cash in euros or euro denominated European Government Obligations or a combination


-----

thereof sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of
independent public accountants, for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes
to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including
delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

to the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of
legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law
after the date hereof);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of

defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject

to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided
for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been
complied with; and

(4) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may

reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of
further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as
expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes
previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain
Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released
to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due
and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one
year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused
to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for
this purpose), money or euro denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination
thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes
not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest
to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity
or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to both the Paying
Agent and the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of such
Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions
precedent under the “—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with as to such Notes, provided that any such
counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the
foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

If requested in writing by the Issuer to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (which request may be included
in the applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to the above-referenced Officer’s Certificate), the


-----

Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed (as agent) by the
Trustee, for this purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to the Stated
Maturity or the applicable redemption date; provided, however, that Holders shall have received at least
three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment (which may be included in the
notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the
maturity or redemption date as set forth above shall not include any negative interest, present value
adjustment, break cost or any additional premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are
represented by a Global Note deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the
beneficial holders holding interests as a participant of such clearing system shall be subject to the then
applicable procedures of the clearing system.

**Meetings of Holders**

All meetings of Holders of each series of the Notes will be held in accordance with applicable Italian
laws and regulation. In addition to and without prejudice to the provisions described above under the
caption “Amendments and Waivers,” in accordance with the provisions set forth under the Italian Civil
Code, the Indenture will include provisions for the convening of meetings of the Holders to consider
any matter affecting their interests, including, without limitation, the modification or abrogation by
extraordinary resolution of any provisions of the Notes or the Indenture. A meeting may be convened
either (i) by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, (ii) by the Noteholders’ Representative (as defined
below) or (iii) upon request by holders of at least 5.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes.

In accordance with the Italian Civil Code, the vote required to pass a resolution by a meeting of the
Holders will be (i) in the case of the first meeting, one or more persons that hold or represent Holders
of more than one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, and (ii) in the case of
the second and any further adjourned meeting, one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of at
least two thirds of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes so present or represented at such meeting.
Any such second or further adjourned meeting will be validly held if there are one or more persons
present that hold or represent Holders of more than one third of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes; provided, however, that the Issuer’s bylaws may provide for a higher quorum (to the
extent permitted under Italian law). Certain proposals, as set out under Article 2415 paragraph 1, item
2, and paragraph 3 of the Italian Civil Code (namely, the amendment of the economic terms and
conditions of the Notes) may only be approved by an extraordinary resolution passed at a meeting of
Holders (including any adjourned meeting) by one or more persons present that hold or represent
Holders of not less than one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes.

With respect to the matters set forth in the second paragraph under “—Amendments and Waivers,” and
to the extent permitted under Italian law, the Indenture will contractually increase the percentage of the
aggregate principal amount of Notes otherwise required by Article 2415 of the Italian Civil Code to
pass an extraordinary resolution with respect to such matters from 50% to 75% of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
_Guarantee and the Security Interests—The Issuer may amend the economic terms and conditions of the_
_Notes without the prior consent of all noteholders with the vote of either 75% or 50% of the aggregate_
_principal amount of the outstanding Notes or the relevant series of Notes, as the case may be.” Any_
resolution duly passed at any such meeting shall be binding on all the Holders, whether or not such
Holder was present at such meeting or voted to approve such resolution.

To the extent provided by the Italian Civil Code, the resolutions passed by a meeting of Holders of the
Notes can be challenged by Holders pursuant to Articles 2377 and 2379 of the Italian Civil Code. The
Indenture will provide that the provisions described under this “—Meetings of Holders” will be in
addition to, and not in substitution of, the provisions described under the caption “—Amendments and
_Waivers.” As such and notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment, supplement and/or waiver, in_
addition to complying with the provisions described under this “—Meetings of Holders” must also
comply with the other provisions described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

**Security Representative and Noteholders’ Representative**

Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance and purchase of
the Notes on the Issue Date shall be deemed to constitute the authorization and agreement on behalf of
the holders of the Notes of the initial appointment as of the Issue Date of U.S. Bank Trustees Limited,
as representative (rappresentante) pursuant to Article 2414 bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code
(the “Security Representative”) in order to create and grant in its favor security interests and guarantees
securing and guaranteeing the Notes and entitle it to exercise in the name and on behalf of the Holders
of the Notes all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to
such security interests and guarantees. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, each holder of the Notes
from time to time, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted, the
appointment of U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as Security Representative.

Moreover, a representative of the holders of the Notes (rappresentante comune) (the “Noteholders’
_Representative”) may be appointed pursuant to Articles 2415 and 2417 of the Italian Civil Code by the_
holders of the Notes in order to represent the interests of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article
2418 of the Italian Civil Code as well as to give effect to resolutions passed at a meeting of the holders
of the Notes. If the Noteholders’ Representative is not appointed by a meeting of the holders of the
Notes, the Noteholders’ Representative shall be appointed by a decree of the Court where the Issuer has
its registered office upon request by one or more holders of the Notes or upon request by the directors
of the Issuer. The Noteholders’ Representative remains appointed for a maximum period of three
financial years but may be subsequently reappointed thereafter.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, any Parent, or any Subsidiaries
or Affiliates of the Issuer, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any
Guarantor under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that
such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such
duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the
Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same
degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of
the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed
as an obligation or duty. Furthermore, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its
rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless such Holder has offered to the
Trustee, and the Trustee has received, customary protection and indemnification.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor
of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in
respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage
in other transactions with the Issuer, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving
written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires actual knowledge
of a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes
insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide


-----

Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment
of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, Taxes
or expenses (including legal fees) Incurred without gross negligence, willful default or fraud on its part,
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be published
on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com). In addition, for so long as any
Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered by or on behalf of the
Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; _provided that, if_
notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and
the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed
to such Person by first class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such
Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder
or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or
communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee
receives it. If a notice or communication is given in via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on
the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the
Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the
Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years after the
applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors under or in connection with the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, including damages. Any
amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement
of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Issuer, any
Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it
from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as
applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so
received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under
any Note (as applicable), the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained
by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify
the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase.
For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter
stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase.
These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the


-----

Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply
irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the
indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order,
claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Notes Guarantee,
or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro
denominated restriction herein, the euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in
a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date such non euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and to admit the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF thereof. There can be no assurance that the
application to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the
Notes on the Euro MTF will be approved and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining
such listing.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and
any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within
the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture, the
Notes Guarantees and the Notes, the Issuer in the Indenture and each Guarantor in its respective
supplemental indenture will irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States. The
Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor, will appoint CT Corporation System, as their
agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes
and the Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City of
New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement and
the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of England. The Security Documents will be governed by the laws of the location of the
relevant asset that is part of the Collateral.

deemed to be Incurred during such period or issues or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
subsequent to the commencement of the Relevant Testing Period but prior to or simultaneously with
the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the “Fixed Charge
_Coverage Ratio Calculation Date”), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving_
_pro forma effect to such Incurrence, deemed Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, repayment,_
repurchase, redemption, defeasance, retirement, extinguishment or other discharge of Indebtedness, or
such issuance, repurchase or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, and the use of


-----

discharged on such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date using proceeds of Indebtedness

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Investments, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and disposed operations that have been made by the Issuer or
any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, during the Relevant Testing Period or subsequent to the Relevant

period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or amalgamated
with or into the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall
have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed
or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such
Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed operation had
occurred at the beginning of the Relevant Testing Period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the

and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate
in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the
entire Relevant Testing Period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such
Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate
reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of
interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. For purposes of making
the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility
computed on a _pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such_
Indebtedness during the Relevant Testing Period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this
definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a
factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined
to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen
as the Issuer may designate.

Senior Secured Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Leverage Ratio, all such components shall be
calculated on a consistent basis, applying the same accounting standard); and (b) any adverse
impact (from the perspective of the Issuer) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from
the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and any successor

## BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM

**General**

The Notes will only be sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S and will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

The Notes are not being offered or sold within the United States.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons who
have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons who hold interests through such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests
will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. Book-Entry
Interests will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof.

Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will
credit a participant’s account on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems with the
interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states
of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those
securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge
Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests
will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in
certificated form and will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes under the Indenture for
any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary of Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(or its respective nominee) will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under
the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants
through which they own Book-Entry Interests to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of
holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent, the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any
aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive registered
Notes in certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) only in the following circumstances:

(a) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue
to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within
120 days; or


-----

(b) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered
through Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture
and enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry
Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (b), their current procedure is to request that the
Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry
Interests and not only to the owner who made the initial request.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names
and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered
Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by
the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the
Registrar, and any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global
Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as
such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the
registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the BookEntry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts
in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period
of fifteen calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any
date fixed for redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed
in part. We are also not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption
or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of
control offer or asset sale offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee
may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents
as described in the Indenture. We may require a holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by
law and permitted by the Indenture and the Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are
mutilated and are surrendered to the Trustee or the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we
will issue and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee) will authenticate a
replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. We or
the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an
indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee, the
Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss
which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We, the Registrar and/or the
Trustee may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions
of the Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay,
redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in
accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer


-----

Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream or
their respective nominees, as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the
Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the
amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable
in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received
by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or
any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream,
if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their
respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by
lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their respective
operational procedures; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal
amount at maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, and interest, additional interest and Additional Amounts, if any) to the
Paying Agent. In turn, the Paying Agent will make such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which
will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures. The Issuer
expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by
participants to owners of Book- Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (i.e., the
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof
for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the
Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent nor any of their respective agents has or
will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments
made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- any other matter relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers
registered in “street name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Initial Purchasers, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents
will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or
expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection
with any such payment. Holders may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and
tax consequences to them.


-----

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in
euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of the Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the BookEntry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event
of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of such
Notes, reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated
form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be done in accordance with Euroclear
and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states
which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer
its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream
and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.”

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only
if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided
in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions
applicable to such notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a BookEntry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global
Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry
Interest.

**Pledges**

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a Book-Entry Interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for
that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons
may be limited.


-----

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely
for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are
controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective
agents are responsible for those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through
electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide
various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement,
lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with
domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations.
Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers
and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and
Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate
for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may
be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will
receive distributions attributable to Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed and admitted to trading on the
Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream
will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating
procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Transfer Agent or the Registrar, or any of their respective agents will
have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear
or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream holders on the Business Day following the settlement date against payment for value
on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the


-----

time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are
open for business.

## CERTAIN TAXATION CONSIDERATIONS

_The information provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and practice_
_currently applicable in Italy and the United States and does not purport to address the tax consequences_
_applicable to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special rules._

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult with their own tax advisors as to the tax_
_consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Notes including, without limitation, the_
_consequences of receipt of interest and premium paid (if any), and the sale or redemption of the Notes_
_or any interest therein._

_The summaries set forth below are based upon, as applicable, Italy or United States law as in effect on_
_the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to any change in such law that may take effect_
_after such date. References in this section to holders of the Notes include the beneficial owners of the_
_Notes. Terms defined under each subsection related to Italy and United States tax law below only have_
_such meanings as defined therein for such respective section. The statements regarding Italy and United_
_States laws and practices set forth below assume that the Notes will be issued, and the transfers thereof_
_will be made, in accordance with the Indenture._

**Certain Italian Tax Considerations**

The statements herein regarding Italian taxation are based on the laws and published practice of the
Italian tax authorities in effect in Italy as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to
any changes in law occurring after such date, which changes could be made on a retroactive basis. The
following is a summary only of the material Italian tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Notes for Italian resident and non-Italian resident beneficial owners, although it is not
intended to be, nor should it be constructed to be, legal or tax advice. The following summary does not
purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations which may be relevant to a
decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences
applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as dealers in securities or commodities)
may be subject to special rules. Neither the Issuer nor any other entity belonging to the Issuer will
update this summary to reflect changes in law or in the interpretation thereof and, if any such change
occurs, the information in this summary could be superseded.

**_Interest on the Notes_**

_Italian Resident Holders of the Notes_

Decree No. 239, regulates the tax treatment of interest, premiums and other income (including the
difference between the redemption amount and the issue price) (hereinafter collectively referred to as
“Interest”) from Notes to the extent:

(a) the Notes are issued by, inter alia, joint stock corporations, whose shares are listed on
a regulated market or on a multilateral trading platform of a member state of the EU or
of a state that is party to the European Economic Area Agreement (each an “EEA
State”) and is included in the list of states allowing an adequate exchange of
information with Italian tax authorities, as indicated in the Italian Ministerial Decree of
September 4, 1996, as subsequently amended and supplemented or in any other future
decrees issued pursuant to Article 11 par. 4 (c) of Decree No. 239 (the “White List
States”); or

(b) the Notes are listed on a qualifying regulated market or on a multilateral trading
platform of member state of the EU or of an EEA State included in the list of White
List States; or


-----

(c) the Notes are held by qualified investors as defined under Article 100 of the Italian
Legislative Decree No. 58 of 28 February 1998.

The provisions of Decree No. 239 only apply to Notes which qualify as obbligazioni or titoli similari
_alle obbligazioni pursuant to Article 44 of Italian Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986,_
as amended and supplemented (“Decree No. 917”). Pursuant to Article 44 of Decree No. 917, for
securities to qualify as titoli similari alle obbligazioni (securities similar to bonds), they must (i)
incorporate an unconditional obligation to pay at maturity an amount not lower than their nominal value
or principal amount (“valore nominale”) and attribute to the holders no direct or indirect right to control
or participate to the management of the Issuer.

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, payments of Interest relating to Notes issued by the Issuer that qualify as
_obbligazioni or titoli similari alle obbligazioni are subject to a tax, referred to as imposta sostitutiva (as_
defined below), levied at the rate of 26% (either when Interest is paid or when payment thereof is
obtained by the holder on a sale of the Notes) where an Italian resident holder of Notes is the beneficial
owner of such Notes, and is:

(a) an individual holding Notes otherwise than in connection with entrepreneurial activity,
unless he has entrusted the management of his financial assets, including the Notes, to
an authorized intermediary and has opted for the application of the so-called risparmio
gestito regime (the “Asset Management Option”) pursuant to Article 7 of Italian
Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997, as amended (“Decree No. 461”);
or

(b) a partnership (other than a società in nome collettivo or società in accomandita
_semplice or similar partnership) or a de facto partnership not carrying out commercial_
activities or professional associations; or

(c) a private or public entity (other than a company) or a trust not carrying out commercial
activities; or

(d) an investor exempt from Italian corporate income tax. All the above categories are
classed as “net recipients.”

Where the resident holders of the Notes described in (a) and (c) above are engaged in an entrepreneurial
activity to which the Notes are connected, imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax and may be
deducted from the income tax due.

Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian resident
individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant
to Legislative Decrees No. 509/1994 and No. 103/1996 may be exempt from any income taxation,
including the imposta sostitutiva, on Interest if the Notes are included in a long-term individual savings
account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth under
Italian tax law.

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the 26% imposta sostitutiva is applied by banks, società di intermediazione
_mobiliare (“SIMs”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del risparmio, stockbrokers and other_
qualified entities, identified by a decree of the Ministry of Finance, which are resident in Italy
(“Intermediaries” and each an “Intermediary”) or by permanent establishments in Italy of banks or
intermediaries resident outside Italy or by organizations or companies non-resident in Italy, acting
through a system of centralized administration of securities and directly connected with the Department
of Revenue of the Ministry of Finance (which includes Euroclear and Clearstream) having appointed
an Italian representative for the purposes of Decree No. 239. For the purposes of applying imposta
sostitutiva, Intermediaries or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries are required
to act in connection with the collection of Interest or, in the transfer of Notes. For the purpose of the
application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act, either


-----

with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in a
change in the Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited.

Payments of Interest in respect of the Notes issued by the Issuer that fall within the definitions set out
above are not subject to the 26% imposta sostitutiva if made to beneficial owners who are:

(a) Italian resident corporation or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign corporations
to which the Notes are effectively connected;

(b) Italian resident partnerships carrying out commercial activities (società in nome
_collettivo or società in accomandita semplice);_

(c) Italian resident open-ended or closed-ended collective investment funds, investment
companies with fixed capital (SICAFs) or investment companies with variable capital
(SICAVs) established in Italy;

(d) Italian resident pension funds referred to in Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of
December 5, 2005 (“Decree No. 252”) and Italian resident real estate investment funds;
and

(e) Italian resident individuals holding the Notes in connection with an entrepreneurial
activity or Italian resident individuals who have entrusted the management of their
financial assets, including the Notes, to an authorized financial intermediary and have
opted for the Asset Management Option.

Such categories are classed as “gross recipients.” To ensure payment of Interest in respect of the Notes
without the application of the 26% imposta sostitutiva, gross recipients must:

(a) be the beneficial owners of payments of Interest on the Notes (if the holder is an
institutional investor, the holder itself is deemed to be the beneficial owner); and

(b) deposit the Notes together with the coupons relating to such Notes in due time directly
or indirectly with an Italian authorized financial Intermediary (or permanent
establishment in Italy of foreign intermediary).

Where the Notes and the relevant coupons are not deposited with an authorized Intermediary (or
permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediary), imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld:

(a) by any Italian bank or any Italian intermediary paying Interest to the holders of the
Notes; or

(b) by the Issuer,

and gross recipients that are Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign
corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected are entitled to deduct any imposta sostitutiva
suffered from income taxes due.

Interest accrued on the Notes would be included in the corporate taxable income (and in certain
circumstances, depending on the “status” of the holders of the Notes, also in the net value of production
for purpose of regional tax on productive activities—IRAP) of the holders of the Notes who are Italian
resident corporations or similar commercial entities or permanent establishments in Italy or foreign
corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected, subject to tax in Italy in accordance with
ordinary tax rules.

Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with entrepreneurial activity who have
opted for the Asset Management Option are subject to a 26% annual substitute tax (the “Asset
Management Tax”) on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year


-----

(which increase would include Interest accrued on the Notes). The Asset Management Tax is applied
on behalf of the taxpayer by the managing authorized intermediary.

Interest accrued on the Notes held by Italian investment funds, SICAVs and SICAFs is not subject to
the imposta sostitutiva, but is included in the aggregate income of the Italian investment funds, SICAVs
and SICAFs. The Italian investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs will not be subject to taxation on such
result, but a withholding tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to distributions made in favor
of unitholders or shareholders (the “Collective Investment Fund Substitute Tax”).

Where an Italian resident noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17
of Decree No. 252) and the Notes are deposited with an Italian resident intermediary, Interest relating
to the Notes and accrued during the holding period will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must
be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period, to be subject to a
20% substitute tax on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year
(which increase would include Interest accrued on the Notes). Subject to certain conditions (including
minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, interest, premium and other income relating to
the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in
a long-term savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the
requirements set forth under Italian tax law.

Where a holders of the Notes is an Italian resident real estate investment fund or a SICAF to which the
provisions of Italian Law Decree No. 351 of September 25, 2001, as subsequently amended, apply,
Interest accrued on the Notes will be subject neither to imposta sostitutiva, nor to any other income tax
in the hands of the Italian real estate investment fund or the SICAF. The income of the Italian real estate
investment fund or the SICAF is subject to tax, in the hands of the unitholder, depending on the status
and percentage of participation, or, when earned by the fund, through distribution and/or upon
redemption or disposal of the units.

_Non-Italian Resident Holders of the Notes_

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, payments of Interest in respect of the Notes issued by the Issuer falling
within the definitions set out in “—Italian Resident Holders of the Notes” above will not be subject to
imposta sostitutiva at the rate of 26%, provided that:

(a) the payments are made to non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes with no
permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected;

(b) such beneficial owners are resident, for tax purposes, in White List States; and

(c) all the requirements and procedures set forth in Decree No. 239 and in the relevant
implementation rules, as subsequently amended, in order to benefit from the exemption
from imposta sostitutiva, are complied with in due time.

The 26% imposta sostitutiva may generally be reduced to 10% or to zero under certain applicable double
tax treaties entered into by Italy, if more favorable, subject to timely filing of required documentation
provided by Measure of the Director of Italian Revenue Agency No. 2013/84404 of July 10, 2013.

Decree No. 239 also provides for additional exemptions from imposta sostitutiva for payments of
Interest in respect of the Notes made to (i) international entities and organizations established in
accordance with international agreements ratified in Italy, (ii) “institutional investors,” whether or not
subject to tax, which are established in White List States and (iii) “Central Banks” or entities which
manage, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State.

To ensure payment of Interest in respect of the Notes without the application of 26% imposta sostitutiva,
non-Italian resident investors indicated above must:


-----

(a) be the beneficial owners of payments of Interest on the Notes (if the holder is an
institutional investor, the holder itself is deemed to be the beneficial owner);

(b) deposit the Notes in due time together with the coupons relating to such Notes directly
or indirectly with an Intermediary, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a nonItalian bank or financial intermediary, or with a non-Italian resident operator
participating in a centralized securities management system which is in contact via
computer with the Ministry of Economy and Finance; and

(c) file in due time with the relevant depository a declaration (autocertificazione) stating,
_inter alia, that he or she is a resident, for tax purposes, in a White List State. Such_
declaration (autocertificazione) which must comply with the requirements set forth by
an Italian Decree of the Ministry for the Economy and Finance of December 12, 2001
(as amended and supplemented), is valid until withdrawn or revoked and need not be
submitted where a certificate, declaration or other similar document meant for
equivalent uses was previously submitted to the same depository. The declaration
(autocertificazione) is not required for non-Italian resident investors that are
international entities and organizations established in accordance with international
agreements ratified in Italy and Central Banks or entities which manage, inter alia, the
official reserves of a foreign state.

Failure of a non-resident holders of the Notes to comply in due time with the procedures set forth in
Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules will result in the application of imposta
_sostitutiva on Interest payments to a non-resident holders of the Notes._

**_Capital Gains_**

_Italian Resident Holders of the Notes_

Pursuant to Decree No. 461, a 26% capital gains tax (referred to as “imposta sostitutiva”) is applicable
to capital gains realized by (i) an Italian resident individual not engaged in entrepreneurial activities to
which the Notes are connected, (ii) a non-business partnership, (iii) a non-business private or public
entity on any sale or transfer for consideration of the Notes or redemption thereof.

Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian resident
individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant
to Legislative Decrees No. 509/1994 and No. 103/1996 may be exempt from any income taxation,
including the imposta sostitutiva, on interest, premium and other income relating to the Notes if the
Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo
termine) that meets the requirements set forth under Italian tax law.

Under the so called “tax declaration regime,” which is the standard regime for taxation of capital gains
realized by Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities to the extent that they
do not opt for the “risparmio amministrato” regime or the Asset Management Option, the 26% imposta
_sostitutiva on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains net of any_
relevant incurred capital losses realized by Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial
activities pursuant to all investment transactions carried out during any given tax year. The capital gains
realized in a year net of any relevant incurred capital losses must be detailed in the relevant annual tax
return to be filed with Italian tax authorities and imposta sostitutiva must be paid on such capital gains
by Italian resident individuals together with any balance income tax due for the relevant tax year.
Alternatively, holders of the Notes who are Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial
activities to which the Notes are connected, may elect to pay imposta sostitutiva separately on capital
gains realized on each sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes (“risparmio amministrato” regime).
Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to:


-----

(a) the Notes being deposited with an Intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of
a foreign intermediary); and

(b) an express election for the so called _risparmio amministrato_ regime being made in
writing in due time by the relevant holder of the Notes.

The Intermediary is responsible for accounting for imposta sostitutiva in respect of capital gains realized
on each sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes, as well as on capital gains realized as at revocation
of its mandate, net of any relevant incurred capital losses, and is required to pay the relevant amount to
the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the holder of the Notes, deducting a corresponding amount from
proceeds to be credited to the holder of the Notes. Where a sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes
results in a capital loss, the intermediary is entitled to deduct such loss from gains of the same kind
subsequently realized on assets held by the holder of the Notes within the same relationship of deposit
in the same tax year or in the following tax years up to the fourth. Under the risparmio amministrato
regime, any realized capital gain is not required to be included in the annual income tax return of the
holders of the Notes and the holders of the Notes remains anonymous.

Special rules apply if the Notes are part of (i) a portfolio managed under the Asset Management Option
by an Italian asset management company or an authorized intermediary or (ii) an Italian Organismo di
_Investimento Collettivo del Risparmio (which includes a_ _Fondo Comune di Investimento, SICAV or_
SICAF). In both cases, capital gains on the Notes will not be subject to 26% _imposta sostitutiva on_
capital gains.

In particular, under the Asset Management Option, any capital gain realized on of the Notes, even if not
realized, will contribute to determine the annual accrued appreciation of the managed portfolio, subject
to the Asset Management Tax. Any depreciation of the managed portfolio accrued at year end may be
carried forward against appreciation accrued in each of the four subsequent years. Under the Asset
Management Option the realized capital gain is not required to be included in the annual income tax
return of the holders of the Notes.

In the case of Notes held by Italian investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs, capital gains on Notes
contribute to determine the increase in value of the managed assets of the Italian investment funds,
SICAVs or SICAFs accrued at the end of each tax year. The Italian investment funds, SICAVs or
SICAFs will not be subject to taxation on such increase, but the Collective Investment Fund Substitute
Tax will apply, in certain circumstances, to distributions made in favor of unitholders or shareholders.

Any capital gains realized by a holders of the Notes that is an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime
provided for by Article 17 of Decree No. 252) and the Notes are deposited with an Italian resident
intermediary, will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the relevant
portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period, to be subject to a 20% on the increase in value of the
managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year (which increase would include Interest accrued on
the Notes). Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and
limitations, capital gains on the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax
if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo
_termine) that meets the requirements set forth under Italian tax law._

Where a holders of the Notes is an Italian real estate investment fund or a SICAF, to which the
provisions of Italian Law Decree No. 351 of September 25, 2001, as subsequently amended, apply,
capital gains realized will be subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax in the
hands of the real estate investment fund or the SICAF. The income of the Italian real estate investment
fund or the Italian SICAF is subject to tax, in the hands of the unitholder, depending on the status and
percentage of participation, or, when earned by the fund, through distribution and/or upon redemption
or disposal of the units.


-----

Any capital gains realized by Italian resident corporations or similar commercial entities or permanent
establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident corporations to which the Notes are connected or Italian
resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, will be
included in their business income (and, in certain cases, may also be included in the taxable net value
of production for IRAP purposes), subject to tax in Italy according to the relevant ordinary tax rules.

_Non-Italian Resident Holders of the Notes_

The 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains may in certain circumstances be payable on any capital
gains realized upon sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes by non-Italian resident individuals and
corporations without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected,
if the Notes are held in Italy.

However, any capital gains realized by non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy
to which the Notes are effectively connected through the sale for consideration or redemption of the
Notes are exempt from taxation in Italy to the extent that the Notes are listed on a regulated market in
Italy or abroad, and in certain cases subject to timely filing of required documentation (in the form of a
declaration (autocertificazione) of non-residence in Italy) with Italian qualified intermediaries (or
permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries) with which the Notes are deposited, even
if the Notes are held in Italy and regardless of the provisions set forth by any applicable double tax
treaty.

Where the Notes are not listed on a regulated market in Italy or abroad:

(a) Pursuant to the provisions of Decree No. 461, non-Italian resident beneficial owners of
the Notes with no permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively
connected are exempt from imposta sostitutiva in Italy on any capital gains realized
upon sale for consideration or redemption of the Notes if they are resident for tax
purposes in a White List State. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian resident
beneficial owners of the Notes without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the
Notes are effectively connected elect for the Asset Management Option or are subject
to the risparmio amministrato regime, exemption from Italian capital gains tax will
apply provided that they timely file with the authorized financial intermediary an
appropriate declaration (autocertificazione) stating that they meet the requirement
indicated above. The same exemption applies in case the beneficial owners of the Notes
are (i) international entities or organizations established in accordance with
international agreements ratified by Italy; (ii) certain foreign institutional investors,
whether or not subject to tax, established in White List States; or (iii) Central Banks or
entities which manage, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State.

(b) In any event, non-Italian resident individuals or entities without a permanent
establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected that may benefit
from a double taxation treaty with Italy, providing that capital gains realized upon sale
or redemption of the Notes are to be taxed only in the country of tax residence of the
recipient, will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva in Italy on any capital gains realized
upon sale for consideration or redemption of the Notes. Under these circumstances, if
non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are
effectively connected elect for the Asset Management Option or are subject to the
_risparmio amministrato regime, exemption from Italian capital gains tax will apply_
provided that they timely file with the authorized financial intermediary appropriate
documents which include, inter alia, a statement from the competent tax authorities of
the country of residence of the non-Italian residents.

The _risparmio amministrato regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to non-resident_
persons and entities in relation to the Notes deposited for safekeeping or administration with Italian
banks, SIMs and other eligible entities, but non-resident holders of the Notes retain the right to waive


-----

this regime. Such waiver may also be exercised by non-resident intermediaries in respect of
safekeeping, administration and deposit accounts held in their names in which third parties’ financial
assets are held.

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

Pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 262 of October 3, 2006, converted into law with amendments by
Italian Law No. 286 of November 24, 2006, effective from November 29, 2006, and Italian Law No.
296 of December 27, 2006, the transfers of any valuable assets (including the Notes) as a result of death
or donation (or other transfers for no consideration) and the creation of liens on such assets for a specific
purpose are taxed as follows:

(a) transfers in favor of spouses and direct descendants or direct ancestors are subject to
an inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 4% on the value of the inheritance or gift
exceeding €1,000,000 (per beneficiary);

(b) transfers in favor of brothers or sisters are subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied
at a rate of 6% on the value of the inheritance or the gift exceeding €100,000 (per
beneficiary);

(c) transfers in favor of relatives up to the fourth degree and relatives-in-law up to the third
degree are subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 6% on the entire
value of the inheritance or the gift; and

(d) any other transfer is subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 8% on the
entire value of the inheritance or the gift.

If the transfer is made in favor of persons with severe disabilities, the tax applies on the value exceeding
€1,500,000.

Moreover, an anti-avoidance rule is provided for by Italian Law No. 383 of October, 2001 for any gift
of assets (such as the Notes) which, if sold for consideration, would give rise to capital gains subject to
the imposta sostitutiva provided for by Decree No. 461. In particular, if the donee sells the Notes for
consideration within five years from the receipt thereof as a gift, the donee is required to pay the relevant
_imposta sostitutiva on capital gains as if the gift was not made._

With respect to the Notes listed on a regulated market, the value for inheritance and gift tax purposes is
the average stock exchange price of the last quarter preceding the date of the succession or of the gift
(including any accrued interest). With respect to unlisted Notes, the value for inheritance tax and gift
tax purposes is generally determined by reference to the value of listed debt securities having similar
features or based on certain elements as presented in the Italian tax law.

Italian inheritance tax and gift tax applies to non-Italian resident individuals for bonds issued by Italian
resident companies.

**_Registration Tax_**

Contracts relating to the transfer of securities are subject to the registration tax as follows: (i) public
deeds and deeds executed in Italy with notarized signatures (atti pubblici e scritture private autenticate)
are subject to fixed registration tax of €200; (ii) private deeds (scritture private non autenticate) are
subject to registration tax of €200 only in the case of use or voluntary registration or occurrence of the
so-called enunciazione.

**_Stamp Duty_**

According to Article 13 of the tariff Part I attached to Italian Presidential Decree No. 642 of October
26, 1972, as amended by Article 1 par. 581 of Italian Law No. 147 of December 27, 2013, a proportional


-----

stamp duty applies on a yearly basis to the periodic reporting communications sent by financial
intermediaries to their clients in respect of any financial product, which may be deposited with such
financial intermediary in Italy. This stamp duty applies at the rate of 0.20% on the market value or—in
the absence of a market value—on the nominal value or the redemption amount or in the case the
nominal or redemption values cannot be determined, on the purchase value of any financial products
and cannot exceed the amount of €14,000 for holders of the Notes that are not individuals. Stamp duty
will apply on the Notes, both to Italian resident holder of the Notes and to non-Italian resident holders
of the Notes, to the extent that the Notes are held with an Italian based financial intermediary.

The statement is considered to be sent at least once a year, even for instruments for which is not
mandatory, nor the deposit, nor the release or the drafting of the statement. In case of reporting periods
of less than twelve months, the stamp duty is payable on a pro rata basis.

Based on the wording of the law and the implementing decree issued by the Italian Ministry of Economy
on May 24, 2012, the stamp duty applies to any investor who is a client (as defined in the regulations
issued by the Bank of Italy on February 9, 2011) of an entity that exercises in any form a banking,
financial or insurance activity within the Italian territory.

**_Wealth Tax on Financial Assets Deposited Abroad_**

According to Decree No. 201/2011, individuals, non-business entities and non-business partnerships
resident for tax purposes in Italy, which hold financial assets—including the Notes—outside of the
Italian territory are required to pay a wealth tax at the rate of 0.2% (the level of tax being determined in
proportion to the period of ownership).

Pursuant to the provision of Article 134 of Law Decree No. 34 of May 19, 2020, the wealth tax cannot
exceed €14 thousand per year for taxpayers different from individuals. This tax applies on the market
value at the end of the relevant year or—in the absence of a market value— on the nominal value or
redemption value, or in the case the face or redemption values cannot be determined, on the purchase
value of any financial assets (including the Notes) held outside of the Italian territory. Taxpayers are
entitled to an Italian tax credit equivalent to the amount of wealth taxes paid in the State where the
financial assets are held (up to an amount equal to the Italian wealth tax due). The financial assets held
abroad are excluded from the scope of the wealth tax if administered by Italian financial intermediaries
pursuant to an administration agreement.

**_Tax Monitoring Obligations_**

Pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 167 of June 28, 1990, converted by Italian Law No. 227 of August
4, 1990, as amended by Italian Law No. 97 of August 6, 2013 and subsequently amended by Italian
Law No. 50 of March 28, 2014 and Italian Law No. 225 of December 1, 2016, individuals, non-business
entities and non-business partnerships (società semplici or similar partnerships in accordance with
Article 5 of Decree No. 917) resident in Italy who hold investments, including the Notes, directly or
indirectly held abroad disclose the aforesaid and related transactions to the Italian tax authorities in their
income tax return (or, in case the income tax return is not due, in a proper form that must be filed within
the same time as prescribed for the income tax return). The requirement applies also where the persons
above, being not the direct holder of the financial investments, are the actual owner of the instrument
under the Italian money-laundering law.

Furthermore, the above reporting requirement is not required to comply with respect to the Notes
deposited for management or administration with qualified Italian financial intermediaries, with respect
to contracts entered into through their intervention, upon condition that the items of income derived
from the Notes have been subject to tax by the same intermediaries and with respect to foreign
investments which are only composed by deposits and/or bank accounts when their aggregate value
never exceeds a €15,000 threshold throughout the year.

**_OECD Common Reporting Standards_**

The EU Savings Directive adopted on June 3, 2003, by the EU Council of Economic and Finance
Ministers (as subsequently amended) on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments
has been repealed from January 1, 2016 to prevent overlap between the Savings Directive and the new
automatic exchange of information regime implemented under Council Directive 2011/16/EU on
Administrative Cooperation in the field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU).

Drawing extensively on the intergovernmental approach to implementing the United States Foreign
Account Tax Compliance Act, the OECD developed the Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) to
address the issue of offshore tax evasion on a global basis. Aimed at maximizing efficiency and reducing
cost for financial institutions, the CRS provides a common standard for due diligence, reporting and
exchange of financial account information. Pursuant to the CRS, participating jurisdictions will obtain
from reporting financial institutions, and automatically exchange with exchange partners on an annual
basis, financial information with respect to all reportable accounts identified by financial institutions on
the basis of common due diligence and reporting procedures. The first information exchanges began in
2017.

Italy has enacted Italian Law No. 95 of June 18, 2015 (“Law 95/2015”), implementing the CRS (and
the amended EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation) Italian Ministerial Decree dated December
28, 2015, which has entered into force on January 1, 2016, implemented Law 95/2015 and provides for
the exchange of information in relation to the calendar year 2016 and later.

In the event that holders of the Notes hold the Notes through an Italian financial institution (as meant
in the Italian Ministerial Decree of December 28, 2015 implementing Law 95/2015), they may be
required to provide additional information to such financial institution to enable it to satisfy its
obligations under the Italian implementation of the CRS.

**_Effect of the IPO Pushdown_**

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Required Consents—
_Provisions Following an IPO” such change in the Issuer may have adverse tax consequences for the_
Italian and non-Italian resident holders of the Notes, as, among others, it may trigger the realization of
a taxable capital gain.

The Italian and non-Italian resident holders of the Notes are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding
the Italian income tax consequences to them of the IPO Pushdown.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be
relevant to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete
analysis of all potential tax considerations. The summary is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S.
Holder, except for the discussions below under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,” and does
not address the tax consequences of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws
(such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.

This discussion is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change at any
time, possibly with retroactive effect that could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax
consequences described below. No rulings from the IRS have been or are expected to be sought with
respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take
a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the


-----

Notes than those discussed herein or that any such position would not be sustained in the event of
litigation. A different treatment than that discussed below could materially and adversely affect the
amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Notes.

This discussion is general in nature and does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences
that may be relevant to a U.S. Holder in light of such U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, including
the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, any alternative minimum tax, or
the base erosion and anti-abuse tax under section 59A of the Code, or to holders subject to special
treatment under U.S. federal income tax rules, such as banks, certain financial institutions, U.S.
expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, dealers in
securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S.
dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships,
S corporations, or other pass-through entities and investors in such entities, entities covered by the antiinversion rules, persons that actually or constructively own more than 10% of our stock (by vote or
value), persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with
respect to the Notes being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in
section 451 of the Code), persons subject to “mark to market” accounting, persons who are lenders
under the Bridge Facility (or are otherwise party to the Bridge Facility Refinancing), and persons
holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated
transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original
issue and at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to
investors for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in
the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets
(generally, property held for investment) within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation
or any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in the
United States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii)
any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv)
any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust, or if the trust has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership (or other pass-through entity) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner or member in such partnership
(or other pass-through entity) generally will depend upon the status of the partner or member and the
activities of the partner or member and the partnership (or other pass-through entity). A partnership (or
other pass-through entity) considering an investment in the Notes, and its partners or members, should
consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes.

The summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations set forth below is for general
information purposes only. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors
concerning the tax consequences that may be relevant to the purchase, ownership and disposition of
Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax.

**_Engineering Merger_**

It is expected that the Issuer will merge with the Company in the first half of 2023, with MergerCo
being the surviving entity (see “Summary—The Transactions—The Whitewash and the Engineering
_Merger”). MergerCo, as the surviving entity, will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes._
Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position (to the extent we are required
to do so) that these transactions will not be treated as resulting in a taxable exchange for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. If this position is respected, a U.S. Holder would not recognize any income, gain


-----

or loss in connection with such transactions and would have the same adjusted tax basis in the Notes as
the U.S. Holder had in the original Notes exchanged therefor. Moreover, the holding period for the
Notes would generally include the holding period for the original Notes.

It is possible, however, that the IRS could take a contrary view, and seek to treat the Engineering Merger
and the assumption of the obligations under the Notes by MergerCo as resulting in a taxable exchange
of the Notes for “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If so, U.S. Holders would recognize
any gain or loss in connection with such taxable exchange (although any such loss could be disallowed
or subject to significant limitations) and would have a new holding period and new tax basis in each
series of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, if the fair market value of a series
of the Notes at the time of the Engineering Merger is less than the principal amount of such series of
the Notes (by more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount), such deemed new Notes may be
treated as issued with OID, in which case the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership
and disposition of such Notes may be different than what is described below. In addition, the
determination of whether the deemed new Notes are treated as contingent payment debt instruments
would be made at the time of the deemed exchange.

U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to
them of the Engineering Merger.

**_Effect of IPO Pushdown_**

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Required Consents—
_Provisions Following an IPO,” such change in the Issuer could result in a deemed exchange of the_
Notes for “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If such modification resulted in a deemed
exchange, such a deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, in which case, U.S. Holders would recognize any gain or loss in connection with such taxable
exchange (although any such loss could be disallowed or subject to significant limitations) and would
have a new holding period and new tax basis in each series of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In addition, if the fair market value of a series of the Notes at the time of the IPO pushdown
is less than the principal amount of such series of the Notes (by more than a statutorily defined _de_
_minimis amount), such deemed new Notes may be treated as issued with OID, in which case the U.S._
federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Notes may be different than
what is described below. In addition, the determination of whether the deemed new Notes are treated
as contingent payment debt instruments would be made at the time of the deemed exchange.

U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to
them of the IPO pushdown.

**_Additional Payments_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” “Description of the
_Notes— Optional Redemption,” and “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”) we may be_
obligated or elect to pay amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on the Notes. If any such
payment is treated as a contingent payment, subject to certain exceptions, the Notes may be treated as
contingent payment debt instruments, in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and
the character of income recognized may be different from the consequences discussed herein. Although
the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of such additional
amounts being payable on the Notes is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of
applicable Treasury regulations as of the date hereof, and thus does not result in the Notes being treated
as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations. Therefore, we do not
intend to treat such potential additional payments as part of the yield to maturity of the Notes. Our
determination that these contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless such
U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the


-----

Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS
takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue income on
its Notes in excess of stated interest, and to treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain any gain
recognized on the taxable disposition of a Note. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisor regarding
the tax consequences if the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The discussion
below assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. In addition,
the determination of whether the deemed new Notes are treated as contingent payment debt instruments
would be made at the time of the deemed exchange.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, payments of stated interest on the Notes
(including any Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any
amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary income
at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method
of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting will be required to include in income (as
ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro denominated interest payment on a Note based on
the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted
into U.S. dollars. No foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be recognized with respect to the
receipt of such payment (other than foreign currency exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition
of the euros so received, See “—Exchange of Foreign Currency”).

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting (or who otherwise is required to accrue
interest prior to receipt) will accrue interest income (as ordinary income) on a Note in euros and translate
the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on:

- the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period, or portion thereof, within
such U.S. Holder’s taxable year; or

- at such U.S. Holder’s election, at the spot rate of exchange on (1) the last day of the accrual
period, or the last day of the taxable year within such accrual period if the accrual period spans
more than one taxable year, or (2) the date of receipt, if such date is within five business days
of the last day of the accrual period. Such election must be applied consistently by the U.S.
Holder to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year
to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder and can be changed only
with the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss on the receipt of an interest payment equal to the difference between (i) the value of the
euros received as interest, as translated into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the date of
receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars, and (ii) the U.S. dollar
amount previously included in income with respect to such payment. Such foreign currency exchange
gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source, and
generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income received on the Notes.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

If the stated principal amount of a series of the Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount equal to
or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 1/4 of 1 percent of the principal
amount of such series of the Notes multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from their
original issue date), then such series of the Notes will be considered to be issued with OID for U.S.
federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to such excess.


-----

If a series of the Notes are issued with OID, a U.S. Holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer)
generally will be required to include in gross income (as ordinary income) any OID as it accrues on a
constant yield to maturity basis, before the holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to this income.
The amount of OID, if any, includible in gross income for a taxable year will be the sum of the daily
portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during that taxable year on which the U.S. Holder
holds the Note. Generally, the daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in an “accrual
period” (other than the initial short accrual period and the final accrual period) a pro rata portion of the
OID allocable to that accrual period. The OID allocable to any accrual period will equal (a) the product
of the “adjusted issue price” of the Note as of the beginning of such accrual period and the Note’s “yield
to maturity” (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly
adjusted for the length of the accrual period) less (b) the qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual
period. The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is unconditionally
payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that is treated as constructively
received, at least annually at a single fixed rate or, under certain circumstances, at a variable rate. Stated
interest on the Notes should be treated as qualified stated interest. The “yield to maturity” is the discount
rate that, when applied to all payments under a Note as of its issue date, results in a present value equal
to the Note’s issue price. The amount of OID allocable to any initial short accrual period generally may
be computed under any reasonable method. The amount of OID allocable to the final accrual period is
the difference between the stated principal amount of the Note and the adjusted issue price of the Note
at the beginning of the final accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note as of the beginning of
any accrual period generally will equal its issue price, increased by previously accrued OID. Under
these rules, a U.S. Holder of a Note issued with OID generally will be required to include in income
increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. Under the Treasury regulations, a
holder of a Note with OID may elect to include in gross income all interest that accrues on the Note
using the constant yield method. Once made with respect to the Note, the election cannot be revoked
without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder considering an election under these rules should consult
its own tax advisor.

The accrual of OID on a Note will be computed in euros, and the amount of accrued OID determined
for any accrual period then will be translated into U.S. dollars, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method
of accounting and in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above with respect
to a U.S. Holder on the accrual basis in “—Payments of Stated Interest.”

Upon receipt of a payment attributable to OID on a Note (whether in connection with a payment on
such Note or the sale, exchange or other disposition of such Note), a U.S. Holder generally will
recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S.
dollar amount of OID that such holder has previously included in income and the U.S. dollar value of
such payment (determined by translating any euros received at the spot rate on the date such payment
is received). Generally, any such exchange gain or loss will be treated as U.S. source and will be treated
as ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as interest income or expense. For this purpose, all
payments on a Note generally will be viewed first, as the payment of stated interest payable on the Note;
second, as the payment of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered
made for the earliest accrual periods first, and third, as the payment of principal.

**_Foreign Tax Credits_**

Stated interest income (as well as any additional amounts as described above in “—Additional
_Payments”) and accrued OID, if any, on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and_
generally will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable
to U.S. Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax with respect to the
Notes held by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits
(or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There are significant
limitations on a U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. The rules governing the calculation
of foreign tax credits are complex and depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, and recent
U.S. Treasury regulations have imposed additional requirements that must be met for a foreign tax to


-----

be creditable (including requirements that a “covered withholding tax” be imposed on non-residents in
lieu of a generally applicable tax that satisfies the regulatory definition of an “income tax,” which may
be unclear or difficult to determine). U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement at maturity, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note,
except as noted below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, a U.S. Holder generally
will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized by such U.S.
Holder (except to the extent such amount is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be
includible in income as ordinary interest income as described above under “—Payments of Stated
_Interest,” to the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. Holder) and such U.S. Holder’s_
adjusted tax basis in such Note on the date of the disposition. Subject to the discussion below, the
adjusted tax basis of a Note to a U.S. Holder will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase
price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase (increased by any previously
accrued OID (if any) required to be included in gross income (as described above under “—Original
_Issue Discount”), and reduced (but not below zero) by payments, if any, previously received by such_
U.S. Holder (other than payments of stated interest)). The amount realized by a U.S. Holder upon the
disposition of a Note will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the euros received calculated at the spot
rate of exchange on the date of disposition.

If the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of
tax accounting, and if it so elects, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting, will
determine the dollar value of its adjusted tax basis in such Note and the amount realized on the
disposition of a Note by translating euro amounts at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of
the purchase or the disposition, respectively. The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders
discussed above must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments from year to
year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not
make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there
are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or
loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for
the Notes exceeds one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains recognized by noncorporate U.S. Holders are eligible for reduced rates of U.S. federal income taxation. Capital gain or
loss, if any, recognized by U.S. Holder generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss for U.S.
foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale, exchange, retirement at maturity, redemption or
other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that
the gain or loss is attributable to changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate during the period in
which the U.S. Holder held such Note. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will equal the
difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of
exchange on the date (1) the Note is disposed of (or the spot rate on the settlement date, if applicable)
and (2) of purchase (or the spot rate on the settlement date, if applicable). In addition, upon the sale,
exchange or other taxable disposition of the Notes, a U.S. Holder may realize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued interest or accrued OID, which will
be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” and “—Original Issue Discount,”
respectively. The recognition of foreign currency exchange gain or loss described in this paragraph will
be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of a Note, and will be treated
as U.S. source ordinary income for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes.

**_Exchange of Foreign Currency_**


-----

Foreign currency (including any euros) received as interest on, or on a disposition of, a Note will have
a tax basis equal to the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency at the time such interest is received
or at the time such proceeds from disposition are received. The amount of gain or loss recognized by a
U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of such foreign currency (A) for U.S. dollars will be equal
to the difference between (1) the amount of U.S. dollars received and (2) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis in such foreign currency and (B) for property (other than U.S. dollars), will be equal to the
difference between (1) the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency paid for such property based on
the spot rate of exchange for such foreign currency on the date of the exchange and (2) the U.S. Holder’s
tax basis in the foreign currency so exchanged. As discussed above, if the Notes are traded on an
established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder) will
determine the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency by translating the foreign currency received at
the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or the disposition. A U.S. Holder that
purchases a Note with previously owned foreign currency will generally recognize gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such foreign
currency and the U.S. dollar fair market value of such Note on the date of purchase.

Any such foreign currency gain or loss generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss for U.S.
foreign tax credit limitation purposes.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Under applicable Treasury regulations, a U.S. Holder who participates in “reportable transactions” (as
defined in the Treasury regulations) must attach to its U.S. federal income tax return a disclosure
statement on IRS Form 8886. The Treasury regulations could be interpreted to cover transactions
generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the
relevant rules, a U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from the Notes
as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the Treasury regulations. U.S.
Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the tax reporting obligations, if any,
including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886, with respect to the ownership or disposition of the
Notes or any related transaction such as the disposition of any euros received in respect of the Notes.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and interest
(including the accrual of OID) on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition
(including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. Holder unless such U.S. Holder is an
exempt recipient (such as a corporation), and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption.
The payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor) will be required to impose backup withholding,
currently at a rate of 24%, on such payments if (1) the U.S. Holder fails to furnish an accurate taxpayer
identification number or to otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding; (2) the IRS
notifies the payor that the taxpayer identification number furnished by the U.S. Holder is incorrect; (3)
there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in section 3406(c) of the Code; or (4) the
U.S. Holder has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct taxpayer
identification number, that it is a United States person, and that the IRS has not notified such U.S.
Holder that it is subject to backup withholding under the Code. Backup withholding is not an additional
tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a credit against a
U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that
the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the effect, if any, of the backup withholding rules on their particular circumstances.

**_Information With Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals and who hold an interest in “specified foreign financial assets”
(as defined in section 6038D of the Code) are required to report (on IRS Form 8938) information
relating to an interest in such assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified
foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account


-----

at certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual
for purposes of the foregoing rules. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect,
if any, of this requirement on their ownership and disposition of the Notes and the significant penalties
for non-compliance.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder
(“FATCA”) generally impose a 30% withholding tax on interest income including accrued OID paid
on a debt obligation if such interest income is treated as a “foreign passthru payment” attributable to
certain U.S. source payments. However, under proposed U.S. Treasury regulations issued in December
2018 (and on which taxpayers may rely until final regulations are issued), such withholding does not
apply to any “foreign passthru payment” that is made before the date that is two years after the date on
which applicable final U.S. Treasury regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are issued.
Additionally, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which
applicable final Treasury regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are issued generally would
be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are materially modified after such date. As of the date of
this Offering Memorandum, applicable final Treasury regulations defining the term “foreign passthru
payment” have not been issued. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution,
FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes
for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of the foregoing grandfathering period. NonU.S. governments have entered into, and others are expected to enter into, intergovernmental
agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described
herein. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their
investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any
payments on the Notes, there generally will be no Additional Amounts payable to compensate for the
withheld amount.

**Certain Other Tax Considerations**

**_Payment by a Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes it is possible that such payments
may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under
the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. It
is not certain that such payments by a Guarantor will be eligible for all the exemptions described above.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. IT DOES
NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR
HOLDER. EACH PROSPECTIVE HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR
ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IN LIGHT
OF THE HOLDER’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.


-----

## SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES

The Notes offered hereby are governed by New York law. However, the Issuer’s creation and issuance
of the Notes (i.e. its corporate resolutions) are governed by Italian law.

The Issuer of the Notes is incorporated under the laws of Italy. TopCo, the Company and the Guarantors
are incorporated under the laws of Italy. Following the Engineering Merger, MergerCo will also be an
entity incorporated under the laws of Italy. The documents relating to the Collateral for the Notes will
be governed by the laws of Italy. The Indenture (including the Guarantees) and the Notes are or will be
governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement, the Existing Term Loan and the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are governed by the laws of England and Wales. All of the
directors and executive officers of the Issuer and of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United
States. Because substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, TopCo, and of the Guarantors, and its and
their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in
the United States against the Issuer, TopCo, MergerCo or the Guarantors or any such other non-U.S.
resident person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and
interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal
or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer
and the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to
the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes,
the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of
process on us or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action,
including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws, or other
laws against us or on such other persons as mentioned above in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction. It
may be possible for investors to effect service of process within other jurisdictions upon those persons,
the Issuer or any Guarantor provided that, for example, The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad
of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is
complied with.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, TopCo, any Guarantor or, following the
Engineering Merger, MergerCo, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the
relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United
States is described below for the countries in which the Guarantors or the Collateral is located, you
should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in
those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**Italy**

Recognition and enforcement in Italy of final judgments rendered by U.S. courts, including judgments
obtained in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities
laws may not require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that pursuant to Article 64 of
Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di diritto internazionale privato),
among others, the following conditions are met:

- the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law
principles of jurisdiction;

- the relevant summons and complaint was appropriately served on the defendants in accordance
with U.S. law and during the proceedings the essential rights of the defendant have not been
violated;

- the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the
event of the defendant party’s failure to appear before the court, the U.S. court declared such
default in accordance with U.S. law;


-----

- the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law;

- there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court;

- there is no action pending in Italy among the same parties for decision on the same matter which
commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

- the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico).

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if a judgment rendered by
a U.S. court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is
necessary, then a proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in Italy to that end.
The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the
fulfillment of all the conditions set out above.

In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely
on the U.S. federal securities law is debatable. If an original action is brought before an Italian court,
the Italian court may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive
provisions of Italian law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply the U.S. law provisions
or grant some of the remedies sought (e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates Italian public
policy and/or any mandatory provisions of Italian law.

## CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE
 VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE
 SECURITY INTERESTS

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which the_
_Issuer, TopCo, the Guarantor and certain subsidiaries are incorporated or organized, and a summary_
_of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests for_
_the Notes. The description below is only a summary, and proceedings (bankruptcy, insolvency or similar_
_events) could be initiated in such jurisdiction and in the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization_
_of any future guarantor of the Notes, and it does not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the_
_limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes and the_
_Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral. Prospective investors in the Notes should_
_consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations._

**European Union**

The Issuer, Topco, MergerCo and the Guarantors are (or, in the case of MergerCo, will be) incorporated
under the laws of Member States of the EU.

On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted in favor of Brexit. There remains considerable uncertainty
and there is likely to be uncertainty for some time to come as to the impact Brexit will have on the
regulatory environment in the EU and the United Kingdom, and on the applicability of EU law in the
United Kingdom. In a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario in particular, it will likely be harder for United Kingdom
office holders and United Kingdom restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in
Member States and to effectively deal with assets located in those other Member States. Much depends
upon the private international law rules in the particular Member State and the need may well arise to
open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular, in cases where the appointment
of a United Kingdom office holder has been made in reliance on a United Kingdom domestic approach,
it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant Member State even if United
Kingdom jurisdiction is taken on the grounds of a United Kingdom center of main interests or
establishment (where such concepts are retained as a matter of United Kingdom domestic law). The
below guidance as to center of main interests and any cross-border proceedings within the EU should
be construed as a description of the current law as at the date of this Offering Memorandum.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of
May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (which entered into force on June 26, 2017 and applies to
insolvency proceedings opened on or after that date) replacing Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29,
2000, (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than
Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “center of main interests” (which
according to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation is “the place where the debtor conducts the
_administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”) is situated_
have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exceptions). The
determination of where a company has its “center of main interests” is a question of fact on which the
courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The second sentence of Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that a company’s “center
_of main interests shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a_
_regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency_
Regulation the “center of main interests” of a company is presumed to be in the Member State in which
it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption only applies if the
registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior to
the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Furthermore, preamble 30 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation states that “it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s central
_administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a_
_comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by_


-----

_third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management_
_of its interests is located in that other Member State.” The courts have taken into consideration a number_
of factors in determining the “center of main interests” of a company, including in particular where
board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has
its head office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established and where
they recognize as being the center of the company’s operations. A company’s “center of main interests”
is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding
which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the
insolvency petition unless (as set forth above) the registered office has been moved within the three
month period prior to the filing of the insolvency petition. If the center of main interests of a company
is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency
proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be opened in such
jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to open the types of
insolvency proceedings.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency
proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

If the “center of main interests” of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is in one
Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation the courts of
another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open (subject to certain exceptions)
secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if
such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any
insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of
doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary
proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An
“establishment” is defined to mean a place of operations where the company carries out or has carried
out in the three month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory
economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings
or territorial insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State (other than Denmark) are
restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State
(other than Denmark) in which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened,
territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State (other than Denmark) where
the company has an establishment only where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in
the Member State in which the company’s center of main interests is situated under that Member State
law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim
arises from or is in connection with the operation of the establishment situated within the territory of
the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority
which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated,
has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are
opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of
whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such
proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local
insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the
company.

The courts of all of the Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing the main proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions), which will be given the
same effect in the other Member States (other than Denmark) so long as no secondary proceedings or
territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there and subject to certain other exceptions
(for instance, rights in rem situated in another Member State remain subject to the original laws
governing such rights). The insolvency practitioner appointed or confirmed by a court in a Member


-----

State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the company’s center of main
interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another
Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member
State) subject to certain limitations (for instance, the powers are available so long as no insolvency
proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been
taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member
State where the company has assets).

In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the EU Insolvency
Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency proceedings of
several members of a group of companies opened in one or more Member States (other than Denmark).
Under Article 61 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested
before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an
insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the
group. Participation in group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency
practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or the Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the
enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

**_Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations_**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other jurisdictions
with which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process.
Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security
interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions
with which holders of the Notes may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include
special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain
reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where
publicly-owned companies are involved.

Insolvency laws and regulations have been replaced by a new crisis and insolvency code. In particular,
the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019
implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 contending the scheme
of a comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, among others, insolvency matters (the
“Legislative Decree”), which enacts a comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, among
others, insolvency matters which came into force on July 15, 2022 (so-called “Code of Business Crisis
_and Insolvency,” hereinafter,_ as subsequently amended and supplemented and including Legislative
Decree No. 83 of 17 June 2022 implementing the EU Directive 2019/1023, the “Italian Insolvency
Code”). Legislative Decree was published in the _Gazzetta Ufficiale_ on February 14, 2019 no. 38—
_Suppl. Ordinario no. 6._

The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term
“bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings
(fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”;
(iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to
access the different restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e
_dell’insolvenza della società)_ provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules
concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with
creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new crisis
settlement procedure (composizione negoziata della crisi); (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over


-----

proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) the adoption of definition of debtor’s “center of main
interest” as provided in the new set of rules concerning group restructurings, (ix) the introduction of
the new restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad
_omologazione) among the restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e_
_dell’insolvenza della società); (x) the regulation of adequate measures and plans to early detect a crisis_
with specific criteria to be adopted by companies and (xi) amendments to certain provisions of the
Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform.

The Italian Insolvency Code has been amended and supplemented by, among others, (i) the Italian
Legislative Decree No. 147 of October 26, 2020, (ii) the Italian Draft Legislative Decree on
“Amendments to the Business Crisis and Insolvency Code, implementing Directive (EU) 2019/1023”
approved on March 17, 2022 by the Italian Council of Ministers (Consiglio dei Ministri) and (iii) the
Italian Legislative Decree No. 83 of June 17, 2022.

Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force
on March 16, 2019, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Italian
Insolvency Code has been initially postponed to September 1, 2021 by the “Decreto liquidità” (i.e.,
Law Decree April 8, 2020, no. 23, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on April 8, 2020 and converted
in law by the Italian Parliament by the Law June 5, 2020, no. 40, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on
June 6, 2020 the “Liquidity Decree”), and is now effective starting from July 15, 2022.

Provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law continue to apply only to any filings for proposals of
declaration of insolvency procedures and bankruptcy restructuring plans (concordato fallimentare) and
any filings seeking for the approval of debt restructuring agreements (accordo di ristrutturazione dei
_debiti) or for the opening of a composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) filed or_
pending before July 15, 2022 (i.e. the effective date of the Italian Insolvency Code).

Considering the above, the following is a brief description of certain main aspects of insolvency law
in Italy as it stands now and in particular: (i) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the other ancillary
applicable regulations in place until July 15, 2022 and (ii) of the Italian Insolvency Code after its entry
into force.

_Italian Bankruptcy Law - applicable to proceedings filed or opened before July 15, 2022 only_

In particular, please find below a brief description of the main provisions of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law and the other ancillary applicable regulations.

The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the
goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the
“Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have
often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are
transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the
insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor
and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law,
occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet with ordinary means its obligations as they
come due. This must be a permanent, rather than a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court
to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or
temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-ofcourt arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which
are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly
challenged as voidable transactions.

In addition to the _composizione negoziata della crisi and to the_ _concordato semplificato_ _per la_
_liquidazione del patrimonio described below, the following debt restructuring and bankruptcy measures_
are available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies.

**_Restructuring Outside of a Judicial Process (Accordi Stragiudiziali)_**


-----

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for
the debtor and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court
restructuring are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and
possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent
bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing temporary financial difficulties,
it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the
existence of the company.

**_Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa (introduced by Law Decree 118/2021)_**

The composizione negoziata della crisi is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in
the two following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 7 of the
Law Decree 118/2021 requesting the competent court pursuant to art. 9 of the Italian Insolvency Law,
to confirm or modify the protective measures (the “Protective Measures”), and, if necessary, to enact
the interim measures provided for pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021 on the same day
as the publication of the request in the relevant Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese) and the
acceptance of the Expert (as defined below); and if necessary to complete the negotiations (the “Interim
Measures” and, together with the Protective Measures, the “Measures”), and (ii) when the entrepreneur
files a petition pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 asking the court to authorize certain
acts, or to modify the conditions of certain contracts if, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic,
such contracts pose an excessive burden on the entrepreneur.

The composizione negoziata della crisi can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore
_commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are in a distressed situation with_
reference to their assets, their business and/or their finance, such that it is likely that a crisis or
insolvency will follow and it is likely that the financial recovery shall occur, notwithstanding the general
thresholds for the application of Italian Bankruptcy Law are not met. Pursuant to Article 5 of the Law
Decree 118/2021, inter alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing for a composizione negoziata della
_crisi (i) shall certify that no requests for the admission to a concordato preventivo procedure nor accordi_
_di ristrutturazione dei debiti have been previously filed to the court in such respect and (ii) in the event_
that the application for a composizione negoziata della crisi is dismissed, may not submit a new request
before one year has elapsed after the aforementioned dismissal.

Pursuant to Article 13 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi may also
apply to group of companies, in order to provide for the possibility of the negotiated proceeding to take
place in a unitary form. It should be noted that Paragraph 10 of such provision provides for the group
companies – at the end of the negotiations – to either enter into one of the agreements referred to in
Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021 (as set out below) as a whole group or enter separately as single
companies into the solutions referred to therein.

The composizione negoziata della crisi is commenced by the enterprises, on a voluntary basis only,
with the filing of a petition for the appointment of a third party and an independent expert (the “Expert”)
which however, pursuant to Article 23 of the Law Decree 118/2021, is prevented for enterprises having
filed to access the procedures, debt restructuring agreements and/or concordato preventivo, including
(i) pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, (ii) pursuant to Article 182-bis,
Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and (iii) the procedures of over-indebtedness restructuring
agreement or liquidation of assets referred to in Articles 7 and 14-ter of Law No. 3 of January 27, 2012
(i.e. procedimenti di composizione della crisi da sovraindebitamento e di liquidazione del patrimonio)
pending such procedures. Pursuant to Article 4 of the Law Decree 118/2021 the person who acted as
Expert in the context of such proceeding, shall not have or maintain professional relations with the
entrepreneur during the two years following the termination of the negotiated proceeding.

If the Expert finds that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the
parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling
periodic meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must
act in good faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the


-----

entrepreneur’s financial and business situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur
and on the information received in the course of the negotiations.

If the Expert finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with
the entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general
of the chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition.

The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties
have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the
entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue for up to an
additional 180 days (pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 7 of the Law Decree 118/2021) if (i) all the parties
involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment
is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 7 and/or
Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021.

Pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 8 of the Law Decree 118/2021, at the end of his/her appointment the
Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the
entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any),
which declares the termination of their related effects.

Pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021, together with the petition for appointment of the
Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective
Measures. The Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant
petition, preexisting creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon
by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what
happens in the concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective
Measures do not apply to employees’ claims.

From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until
the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the
entrepreneur cannot be declared bankrupt nor insolvent by the court.

The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform
their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor
anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur,
solely on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition
requesting the application of the Protective Measures.

If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), he
must simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the
said measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the
Protective Measures will be ineffective.

The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an
order of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after
obtaining the opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the
negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days. The judge, in his or her discretion, may order the revocation
of such Protective Measures or shorten their duration.

Upon request of the entrepreneur or of one or more creditors, or upon report of the Expert, the Protective
Measures and the Interim Measures can be revoked, or their duration can be reduced, if they do not
satisfy the purpose of a positive finalization of the negotiations or appear to be disproportionate
compared to the prejudice caused to the creditors that file the relevant request.

Pursuant to Article 9 of the Law Decree 118/2021, pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry
out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining
to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the
perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and financial sustainability
of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is


-----

insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the
best interests of the creditors, subject to his liabilities.

If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the
perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control
body. If, notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the
entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with
the companies’ register. When Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures have been granted, the
Expert also reports to the court which may revoke such measures or reduce their duration pursuant to
Article 7, Paragraph 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021.

Pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to
the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the
maximization of the creditors’ recovery, may authorize:

(i) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new supersenior indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(ii) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called _prededucibile) via_
shareholders’ financing pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(iii) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects
provided under Article 2560, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it
will be for the court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate, taking into account
the requests of the parties concerned, in order to protect the interests of all relevant parties
involved.

Pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi can terminate
as follow:

(i) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which
constitutes cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 14 of the Law
Decree 118/2021 if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the
continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years;

(ii) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 182 octies
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(iii) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with
the effects provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. In
such case, the independent expert’s report (attestazione) provided under Article 67, Paragraph
3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, shall not be required.

At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur can also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a
debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article
182-bis, Article 182 septies or Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Alternatively, the entrepreneur may:

(i) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article
67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(ii) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio
pursuant to Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 which pursuant to Article 11 of the Law
Decree 118/2021 can be filed only following the end of the negotiations;

(iii) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Bankruptcy Law or in
the so-called Prodi bis procedure or Marzano procedure.

Pursuant to Article 12 of the Law Decree 118/2021:

(i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 maintain
their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors


-----

(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-bankruptcy
composition with creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), bankruptcy (fallimento),
compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary
administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or _concordato_
_semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio;_

(ii) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the
granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted
from claw-back actions pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if
they are consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the
perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of
security interest was made;

(iii) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert
accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 66 and Article 67
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’
register or if the court has denied its authorization pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree
118/2021;

(iv) payments and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert
assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of
recovery (risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant
to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, benefit of exemptions from the potential application
of certain criminal sanctions provided for pursuant to Article 216 and 217 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law.

**_Potential outcomes: concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio (introduced by_**
**_Law Decree 118/2021)_**

Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy
composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
_patrimonio)._

If, in its Final Report, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome but have
been conducted according to fairness and in good faith, and that the options provided under Article 11,
Paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Law Decree 118/2021 are not feasible, within 60 days following the
notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file, with the competent court of the place where
the company has its registered office, a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la
liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under Article
161, Paragraph 2, letters a), b), c) and d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, which may divide the creditors
into various classes. The petition for concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then
published in the companies’ register within the day following the filing with the court. From the date
of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 111, 167, 168 and 169 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law apply.

The court issues a decree approval (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws
and regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is
compliant with preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the
proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of
insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain
recovery.

The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after
having been notified of the same.

**_Out-of-Court Reorganization Plans (Piani di Risanamento) Pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d)_**
**_of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_**


-----

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento)
prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their
financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility
of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no
need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional
requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil
Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification.

Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and,
therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court
debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority
of all outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at
restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike in-court prebankruptcy agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans
do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of
third-party creditors or any public authority including tax authorities. The Italian Bankruptcy Law
provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts
carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject
to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential
application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the
Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a
debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or
disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt
restructuring agreement.

**_Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy_**
**_Law (Accordi di Ristrutturazione dei Debiti)_**

The debtor may negotiate with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debt
restructuring agreements, subject to court’s approval (omologazione). An independent expert appointed
by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company
and declare that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be
fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by
the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date
of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from
the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the
non-participating creditors as at the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring
agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e.,
facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the
court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication.
The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of
the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the
prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party,
and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The
debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred
payment of certain taxes.

The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the abovementioned publication of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such moratorium request must
be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court,
having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing
within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in
relation to the moratorium to the creditors. At such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions


-----

for anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or
enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired
over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt
restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited.

The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an
application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the
effect of the moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30
days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the
oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed
within 15 days of its publication.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the
outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements
(accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors.

The new Article 182-bis, Paragraph 8 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law No.
69 of May 21, 2021, and subsequently replaced by the Law Decree 118/2021, sets the rule for when
substantial amendments are made to the plan, _inter alia, if any substantial change to the plan are is_
necessary or required before or after the homologation of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors,
the entrepreneur shall make the appropriate changes aimed at the implementation of such plan,
requesting (i) the independent expert to renew its report as well as (ii) the creditors involved in such
debt restructuring agreement to manifest their consent the necessary amendments.

The Law Decree 118/2021 significantly amended Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and
introduced in the Italian Bankruptcy Law the new Article 182 octies, Article 182 novies and Article 182
_decies, thus anticipating some of the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code._

Pursuant to the new Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree
118/2021, the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law is reduced to the 30% if the debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of its creditors
provided for under Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, letters (a) and (b) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
(therefore implying that the plan must be adequate and capable for the full and timely payment of
dissenting creditors); (b) does not previously file a petition for admission to the concordato in bianco
pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and (c) does not request the 60days moratorium pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors are entitled to enter into
debt restructuring agreements by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the
credits belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and
economic interests), and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering
creditors of the same category (a so-called “cram-down”), provided that certain conditions are met,
including that non-participating creditors shall be satisfied to a no lesser extent than the liquidation
alternative. The law also provides that (i) the agreement shall be of a non-liquidating nature, (ii) the
agreement shall contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going
concern, and (iii) all the creditors belonging to the relevant category (and, therefore, affected by the
proceeding) have been duly notified of the beginning of the negotiations, have been kept informed and
have been notified the debt restructuring agreement and the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa)
and the related documentation. If these conditions are met, the remaining 25% of non-participating
creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, non-participating
crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it.

Pursuant to Article 11 of The Law Decree 118/2021 the percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the
reach of the debt restructuring agreement results from the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end
of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata della crisi.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 septies, Paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a special provision
is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this
situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are


-----

banks and financial intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests
and extend the effects of the agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category.
In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation
of the business activity as a going concern. However, in such case, the rights of creditors who are not
banks or financial intermediaries remain valid.

Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a standstill agreement
(convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same
class would also bind the non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting
the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies (i)
the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate
the effects of the crisis and **_(iii)_** the fact that the non-adhering creditors suffer a prejudice that is
proportionate and consistent with the recovery strategies undertaken by the debtor, and (B) certain
further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly
noticed of the beginning of the negotiations have been made able to participate in the negotiations and
have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial
situation and on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can
challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same.

The debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and
the standstill agreement provided under Article 182 _octies_ of the Italian Bankruptcy Law shall not
impose new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to
utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities on non-participating creditors.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-decies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree
118/2021, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt
restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are
jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right
of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards
the shareholders who are jointly liable with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such
shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors

Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant
to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with
Creditors) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing
granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e.,
before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a court- supervised PreBankruptcy Composition with Creditors (finanza ponte) or granted in execution of the composition with
creditors (finanza in esecuzione) may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the
relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of
approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement or the approval of the PreBankruptcy Composition with Creditors.

Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending
the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis,
Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to
Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161,
Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy
arrangement with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly
requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness with in rem
security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor,
having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione),
declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and
(ii) to pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable
and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the
company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the
provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may


-----

be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161,
Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring
agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato
_preventivo) outlined below._

Furthermore, according to the Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law,
pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182_bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant_
to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to
Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the
debtor to incur in new super senior (so-called prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent
financial needs related to the company’s business. The company, while filing such request of
authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise
obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and
irreparable prejudice to the company.

**_Court Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (Concordato Preventivo)_**

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet
amount to insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a
composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall
indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the
initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial
enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an
aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue
(ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years,
and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a
petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan
and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the
truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato
_preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication_
to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief
actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo
by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures
sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain
security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding
the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are
ineffective against such pre-existing creditors.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring
and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure
payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors
with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to
creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible
into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore)
of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors
into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition
proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary
petition for a concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph
6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian
Law No. 98/2013 (“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i)
its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the
reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan,


-----

the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120
days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension
of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). In advance
of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement
(pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary
petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company,
who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration
of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon
further verification, may reject the petition at court for a _concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth_
reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory
provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to
in respect of the concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo
(so-called concordato in bianco).

The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two
years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term
for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also
relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes
of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a
monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a
monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the
company’s register.

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors
being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided
that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into
bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the
preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the
debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional
documents.

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition
with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii)
seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they
are urgent.

Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior
indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring
agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of
the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also
in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law,
aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business as recently introduced by
Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so-called
_prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and_
security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the super- seniority of the claims—which
arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the
composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being
filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the _concordato preventivo_
within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition.

The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by
the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies
and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con
_continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe_


-----

the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going
concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the
independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction
of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented.
Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the
winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice
_delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and_
calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues
to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed
judicial officers and judge. The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only
upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without
authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are supersenior (so-called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable
vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the
event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The
Composition with Creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in
favor of the proposal. Law 132/2015 abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors
who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those who did not express their dissent within 20 days of
the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed as consenting to the composition with
creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’
meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting
and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve
the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato
proceeding, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to
meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to
vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities
in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured
creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they
waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of
the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in
which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court
may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes
objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of
the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an
objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case
there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the
court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims
are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise
be the case.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for
individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least
10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a prebankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met,
including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the
unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation
purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of
pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con
_continuità aziendale)._

In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets forth that
a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a prebankruptcy agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such


-----

assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are
paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims.

This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the
going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may
grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate,
including by taking all corporate actions required.

In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as
amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors
(concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law,
includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified
third party, the judicial commissioner may request to the court the opening a competitive bidding
process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors. After the approval by the
creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if
any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order.

Pursuant to article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court
to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente
_eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g.,_
employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale
agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate
lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili). The request may be filed with the competent court
at the time of the filing of the application for the _concordato preventivo_ or to the judge (giudice
_delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the_
pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just
once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to
the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid
prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition.

If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of
the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare
the company bankrupt.

**_Impacts of the COVID-19 emergency on Insolvency Proceedings_**

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian Government adopted new urgent measures, inter
_alia, on insolvency matters (in addition to the Law Decree 118/2021 mentioned above) in order to (i)_
preserve the continuity of companies throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and after its end, with
particular regard to those that were trading on a going concern basis before the COVID-19 pandemic,
and (ii) ensure the successful outcome of certain insolvency proceedings already pending during the
COVID-19 pandemic or already approved by the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among such legislative measures, the Italian Government enacted the Liquidity Decree.

According to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree the deadlines for the fulfilment of concordati preventivi
and the ratified debt restructuring agreements provides, among other things, the extension of 6 months
of the deadlines for fulfillment of the obligations provided in an approved _concordato preventivo or_
_accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologati based on a plan expiring after February 23, 2020 shall_
be extended by six months. In the procedures for the approval (omologazione) of a concordato and of
a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti), pending on
February 23, 2020, the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition for the grant of an extension up
to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a concordato preventivo in accordance
with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt restructuring agreement pursuant to
Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date of the decree by which
the court assigns the term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the


-----

context of a _concordato preventivo_ in the course of which it has already been held the meeting of
creditors but the majorities were not reached according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Also, a set of measures is aimed at “relaxing” directors’ duties in connection with insolvency/preinsolvency scenarios. The rules requiring the recapitalization (or liquidation or transformation into a
different company type) of companies whose losses have substantially eroded the share capital will not
apply with respect to losses arisen in the financial year ended on December 31, 2020 and until the five
subsequent financial years. This measure, originally provided for by Article 6 of the Liquidity Decree,
subsequently replaced by Article 1, Paragraph 266, of Law No. 178 of December 30, 2020, is intended
to address the risk that the impact of losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic on the share capital
of companies push directors into the unsustainable position of choosing between the following: (i)
putting the company into liquidation or into a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or (ii) facing
potential personal liability as a result of the delay in complying with such obligations.

**_Bankruptcy Proceedings (Fallimento)_**

A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the
judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the
public prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law,
occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they
come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is
applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds
are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3
million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an
aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total
indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million.

Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things:

- subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, actions are stayed and creditors must file
claims within a defined period;

- under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as
their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of
liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant
expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits,
any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank _pari passu_ with all of the
bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court
authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’
committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in its
decision;

- the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy
receiver (curatore fallimentare);

- continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater
damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause
damage to creditors;

- any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and
in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings,
other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and

- the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy
declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over.

Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some
or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly
provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law.


-----

Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a
deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a
representative of any one of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the
debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in
accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time,
particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate properties. In this respect, Law
132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the
requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation
of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential
creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of
payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is
unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual
arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent
with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and
secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated.

- **Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato** **_fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can_**
terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The
relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties or the receiver starting from
the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a
proposal only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the
decree giving effectiveness to the bankruptcy’s estate (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not
entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive
their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of
the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert),
in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The
petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different
treatments among the classes), and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition
may provide that secured claims are paid only in part. The concordato fallimentare proposal must
be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims
(and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes).
Final court confirmation is also required.

- **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law**
may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU
jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation
shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e.,
claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for
payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the
payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the
costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including the claims of
the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The
remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori
_privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by_
law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured
creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s
estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can
deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating
one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles. The law creates a hierarchy of
claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire
bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset.

- **Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back”**
or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, among others, to the revocation of
payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of
bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value,


-----

preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules
under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy
compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one
year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other
transactions. Please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described
below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian
Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law
and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court
commissioner, as detailed below.

- **Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject**
to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à_vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency_
declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon
registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait the ineffectiveness
of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration
before the delegated judge for violation of law; and (ii) Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law,
payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are
deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period
prior to the insolvency declaration.

- **Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver.**

(a) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below (so
called “suspect period”), may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided
for by article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the noninsolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s
insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into:

(i) onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the

value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the
value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor;

(ii) payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by

other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration;

(iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency

declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time when
the new security was granted; and

(iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the

insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due
at the time when the new security was granted.

(b) The following acts and transactions, if made during the suspect period or such other period

specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy
receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the
time of the act or transaction:

(i) payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions

entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and

(ii) granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency

declaration.

(c) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:


-----

(i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to

market practice;

(ii) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently

reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank;

(iii) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the

Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential
property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family
(within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main
seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency
declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the
commencement of such activity have been carried out therein;

(iv) transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor pursuant

to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of

“concordato preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo
_di ristrutturazione del debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_

(vi) remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning

work carried out by them; and

(vii) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with

respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt
entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria)
provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may
demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such
creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity
was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim
was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the
purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for
consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was
entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party participated in the
fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a
“simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place
by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In
particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without
previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to
the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or
creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In
case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the
third-party purchaser.

**_Italian Insolvency Code_**

Please find below a brief description of the main provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code after its
entry force on July 15, 2022 which supersedes the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The two primary aims of the Italian Insolvency Code are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect
the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims. The aim of the
“Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure (which remain available to large companies also in the
context of the new set of rules, as will be further detailed below), is to maintain employment. These
competing aims often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring
that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.


-----

Under the Italian Insolvency Code, the judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) must be declared
by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a debtor upon a petition filed by the debtor itself,
the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2, letter (b) of
the Italian Insolvency Code, is defined as the state of the debtor, manifested by defaults and/or other
external elements evidencing that the debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they
come due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to
hold that a debtor is insolvent. The Italian Insolvency Code also introduced a specific concept of crisis,
which is defined under Article 2, letter (a) of the Italian Insolvency Code as the state of the debtor such
that it is likely that insolvency will follow, which is manifested by the inadequacy of prospective
cash flows to meet obligations in the following 12 months. Both insolvency and crisis are factual
situations upon the occurrence of which different instruments provided for by the Italian Insolvency
Code may be activated.

In cases where a debtor is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, a
state of crisis/financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with
its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the debtor, but which are susceptible of being
reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable
transactions.

The following debt restructuring and insolvency alternatives are available under Italian law for
companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent debtors and, in certain cases, also to debtors
experiencing an economic or financial imbalance such as to make it likely that a state of crisis and/or
distress or their insolvency will occur.

_Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for
the debtor and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court
restructuring are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and
possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent
bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may
be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the
existence of the company.

_Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code_

The composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa was originally introduced in the
Italian legal framework by Law Decree 118/2021 and has been subsequently incorporated into the
Italian Insolvency Code. It is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two
following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian
Insolvency Code requesting the competent court to confirm or modify the Protective Measures
provided for pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code on the same day as the publication
of the request in the relevant Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese) and the acceptance of the
Expert (as defined below), and, if necessary, to enact the Interim Measures necessary to complete the
negotiations, and (ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition asking the court to authorize certain acts in
line with the provisions set forth under Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

The composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is a proceeding aimed at facilitating
the recovery of companies which “despite being in conditions of asset or economic and financial
_imbalance such as to make it likely that financial distress or insolvency will occur, have the potential_
_to remain in the market, including through the sale of the business or a branch of it.”_

According to Article 12 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione
_della crisi d’impresa can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore commerciale)_
and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are undergoing a distressed situation with reference
to their assets, their business and/or their financial situation, such that it is likely that a distress/crisis
or insolvency will follow. It is, therefore, a procedure aiming at anticipating further deterioration of
the debtor’s situation. Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code, inter


-----

_alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing for a composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi_
_d’impresa (i) shall certify that no judicial winding-up proceedings or similar proceedings are pending_
towards itself nor requests for the admission to the procedures provided for under Articles 40 of the
Italian Insolvency Code, including pursuant to Articles 44, paragraph 1, letter a) and 54, paragraph 3,
have been previously filed and (ii) in the event that the application for a composizione negoziata per
_la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is dismissed, other than the case where such dismissal is requested_
by the entrepreneur, may not submit a new request before one year has elapsed after dismissal.

Pursuant to Article 25 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione
_della crisi d’impresa may also apply to group of companies, which may commence one proceeding all_
together. It should be noted that paragraph 9 of such provision provides for the group companies—at
the end of the negotiations—to either enter into one of the agreements referred to in Article 23,
paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code as a group, or use one of the tools referred to under Article
23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, both separately or as a whole group. The composizione negoziata
_per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is commenced on a voluntary basis only, filing of a petition for_
the appointment of a third party and independent expert to the Secretary General of the relevant
Chamber of Commerce by way of a dedicated electronic platform (the “Expert”). Pending a procedure
for over-indebtedness restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets referred to in Articles 7 and
14-ter of Law No 3 of 27 January 2012 (i.e., _procedimenti di composizione della crisi da_
_sovraindebitamento e di liquidazione del patrimonio), the petition cannot be filed. Pursuant to Article_
16 of the Italian Insolvency Code the person who acted as Expert in the context of such proceeding,
shall not have or maintain professional relations with the entrepreneur during the two years following
the termination of the negotiated proceeding.

The Expert is appointed within five days upon the filing of the request. The Expert is responsible for
facilitating and managing the negotiations between the company, its creditors and any other interested
parties, in order to identify a solution to overcome the crisis or the insolvency, including through the
transfer of the business or a branch thereof.

The Expert assesses his/her own independence, the adequacy of his/her own professional expertise and
his/ her own time availability with respect to the prospected assignment, and, if the outcome of the
assessment is positive, notifies his/her acceptance to the entrepreneur and uploads it on the Platform.
In case of negative outcome, the Expert confidentially notifies it to the commission, which appoints a
new Expert. If the Expert accepts the appointment, he/she meets with the entrepreneur in order to assess
whether there are concrete and real chances of recovery. The entrepreneur attends the meeting
personally, and can be assisted by its advisors.

If the Expert finds that there are concrete and real chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets
with the parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies,
scheduling periodic meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties
involved must act in good faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on
the entrepreneur’s situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the
information received in the course of the negotiations. The entrepreneur must provide a complete and
clear representation of his/her situation and manage his/her assets without causing unfair prejudice to
the creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents, and, in case of credit assignment and/or
transfer, their assignees or transferees, must take part in the negotiations actively and in an informed
manner, and the access to the _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa_ does
not, by itself, constitute ground for withdrawal of overdraft facilities. Specific provisions apply to
negotiations involving employment contracts.

If the Expert finds that there are no real chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the
entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of
the chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The Expert’s
appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not
agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s
distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue up to further 180 days (pursuant
to Article 17, paragraph 7 of the Italian Insolvency Code) if (i) all the parties involved in the


-----

negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by
the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 19 and/ or Article 22
of the Italian Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 8 of the Italian Insolvency Code, at the end of his/her appointment
the Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the
entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any)
which declares the termination of their related effects.

Pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with the petition for appointment of
the Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective
Measures, which may also be limited, upon entrepreneur request, to certain creditors’ claims or to a
specific category of creditors. The Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of
publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di
_prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed._
However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting creditors
is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims

From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until
the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for the composizione negoziata,
the ruling of opening the judicial winding-up proceeding (sentenza di apertura della liquidazione
_giudiziale) or the declaration of the insolvency of the entrepreneur cannot be declared insolvent by the_
court, provided that the court revokes the Protective Measures.

The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to
perform their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such
contracts, nor anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the
entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of
the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures. However, the creditors may suspend
the fulfilment of the pending contracts from the publication of the petition requesting Protective
Measures to the obtainment of such Protective Measures.

If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), it
must simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check
the said measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request,
the Protective Measures will be ineffective.

The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an
order of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after
obtaining the opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the
negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days, given that the judge may discretionary order the
revocation of such Protective Measures or shorten their duration.

During the procedure the entrepreneur remains able to continue the ordinary and extraordinary
management of the company, subject to certain conditions. More precisely, pursuant to Article 21 of
the Italian Insolvency Code, pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining
to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary
activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery,
in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and financial sustainability of the business.
Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but
there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the best interests
of the creditors, subject to his liabilities.

If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the
perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control
body. If, notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the
entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration
with the companies’ register. At the request of the entrepreneur, one or more creditors or the Expert,
the Court that has granted the Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures may, at any time, revoke


-----

such measures or reduce their duration when they do not meet the aim of ensuring the positive outcome
of the negotiations or they appear disproportionate in relation to the prejudice caused to the creditors,
pursuant to Article 19, paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code. If the Protective Measures are
revoked, the prohibition of the obtainment of preemption rights by preexisting creditors ceases to be
effective for the date on which the Protective Measure has been revoked.

Pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to
the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the
maximization of the creditors’ recovery, may authorize:

(a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior

indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code;

(b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called _prededucibile) via_

shareholders’ financing pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

(c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects

provided under Article 2560, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code, without prejudice to Article
2112 of the Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify the
measures it considers appropriate, taking also into account the requests of the parties concerned,
in order to protect all the interests involved. The court shall also verify the compliance with the
competitiveness principle in choosing the purchaser.

Pursuant to Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione
_della crisi d’impresa can terminate as follow:_

(a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes

cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 25-bis, paragraph 1 of the
Italian Insolvency Code if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the
continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years;

(b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 62 of the

Italian Insolvency Code;

(c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert,

with the effects provided under Articles 166, paragraph 3, lett. d) and 324. With such agreement
the Expert acknowledges that the reorganization plan (piano di risanamento) seems to be
consistent with the composition of the insolvency and crisis of the entrepreneur.

At the end of the negotiations, if none of the above mentioned agreement is executed, the entrepreneur
may alternatively:

(a) file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo

_di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Articles 57, 60 and 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code._
The percentage referred to under Article 61, paragraph 2, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code
is reduced to 60% if the achievement of the agreement results from the final report of the Expert.

(b) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article

56 of the Italian Insolvency Code;

(c) file a petition for admission to the _concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio_

provided for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code;

(d) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Insolvency Code or in the

so-called Prodi-bis procedure or the Marzano procedure;

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 24 of the Italian Insolvency Code:

(i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code shall maintain

their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors
(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-judicial
liquidation composition with creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), opening of the judicial
winding-up proceeding (apertura della liquidazione giudiziale), a sanctioned restructuring plan


-----

provided for pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Italian Insolvency Code, a compulsory
administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary administration for
large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or simplified pre-judicial liquidation
composition with creditors agreement aimed at the liquidation of the debtor’s assets (concordato
_semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio) provided for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the_
Italian Insolvency Code;

(ii) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the

granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from
claw-back actions pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code if they
are consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives
of recovery (risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest
was made;

(iii) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert

accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 165 and Article 166
of the Italian Insolvency Code if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register
pursuant to Article 21, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code or if the competent court has
denied its authorization pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

(iv) payment and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert

assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of
recovery (risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant
to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code, benefit of exemptions from the potential application
of certain criminal sanctions.

_Potential outcomes: concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio_

Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-judicial
liquidation composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la
_liquidazione del patrimonio)._

If, in its Final Report, in the context of a composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa
proceeding, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome (i.e. the entrepreneur
has not been able to reach an agreement with its creditors) but have been conducted according to
fairness and good faith and that the options provided under Article 23, paragraphs 1 and 2, letter b), of
the Italian Insolvency Code are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final
Report the entrepreneur may file to the competent court where the entrepreneur has its center of main
interests a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio,
together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under Article 39 of the Italian Insolvency
Code. The petition for concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then published
in the companies’ register within the day following the filing with the court. From the date of such
publication, the effects provided under Articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 of the Italian Insolvency Code are
produced.

Following the filing of such application, the court (i) appoints a so-called “auxiliary” (ausiliario) to,
_inter alia, express an opinion on the entrepreneur’s proposal; (ii) orders that the proposal, together with_
the opinion of the auxiliary and the final report of the expert, be delivered by the debtor to the
creditors appearing on the list filed by the debtor itself; and (iii) sets the date of the hearing for the
court approval (omologazione). Creditors and any third party which has any interests are entitled to
object to the court approval (omologazione) within ten days before the date fixed for the hearing.

If the court, having verified the legitimacy of the objection and the procedure, as well as compliance
with priority creditor claims and the feasibility of the liquidation plan, finds that the proposal does not
prejudice the creditors with respect to the alternative of a judicial winding-up liquidation and that, in
any event, it ensures a benefit to each creditor, it approves the composition with creditors proposal by
decree, by which it shall also appoint a liquidator.

The court issues a decree of approval (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione


-----

_del patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant_
laws and regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal
is compliant with preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii)
the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case
of insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain
recovery. With the approval decree, the court also appoints a liquidator.

The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after
having been notified of the same.

Pursuant to Article 25-septies of the Italian Civil Code, the liquidation plan may also include an offer
by a pre-identified third party to transfer the business or one or more branches of the business or
specific assets to such third party, even before the approval: in this case, the judicial liquidator, having
verified the absence of better solutions on the market, may implement the offer.

_Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian_
_Insolvency Code_

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani attestati di
_risanamento) addressed to the creditors and prepared by debtors who are either insolvent or in a state_
of crisis, in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial
condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor and enrolled in the Register of
Auditors and Accounting Experts (Registro dei Revisori Contabili) must verify the feasibility of the
restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no
need to obtain court approval to appoint the independent expert. The independent expert must possess
certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article
2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false
certification.

Out-of-court reorganization plans and the relevant debt restructuring arrangements are not under any
form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court
or supervising authority. Also, Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be
approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided they are finalized at
restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. However, the
possibility to adopt such tools to liquidate the debtor is disputed, as it is argued they shall provide
for the restructuring of the debtor’s indebtedness and the rebalancing its financial condition on a going
concern basis. Unlike in-court pre-judicial liquidation agreement proceedings and debt restructuring
agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against
enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Insolvency
Code provides that, should these plans fail, and the debtor be declared insolvent, the payments and/or
acts carried out, and/or security interest granted on the debtor’s assets for the implementation of the
reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to any claw-back action (azione
_revocatoria), including the claw-back action provided for pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil_
Code, as provided for pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code;
and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification
by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the
Companies’ Register of the plan, the report by the independent expert and the arrangements is
possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of
bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-judicial liquidation
agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. Since the reorganization plan (or the agreements entered
into to implement it) is not subject to any court approval or judicial review, it cannot be excluded that
the abovementioned exemption effects will be challenged in the event of subsequent judicial windingup, if the competent court were to assess that the reorganization plan was not feasible at the time it was
certified by the independent expert.

Unlike Italian Bankruptcy Law, Italian Insolvency Law sets forth specific rules regarding Out-of-court


-----

reorganization plans and the relevant restructuring arrangements entered into with creditors, which
must be followed for the plans and agreements to grant protection against claw-back actions and
potential civil and criminal responsibilities. More in detail, out-of-court debt restructuring plans
pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency Code must be supported by adequate documentation
representing the financial and commercial situation of the debtor and which also needs to indicate,
among others, the causes of the crisis and the new resources which will be made available to the debtor
and the industrial plan. Moreover, they must be suitable for the purpose of assuring the restructuring
of the indebtedness of the debtor and rebalancing its financial position and, in case of its failure and
subsequent challenge (impugnazione) before an Italian court, it must not be deemed as being
unreasonable.

_Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article_
_57 of the Italian Insolvency Code_

Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) provided for
pursuant to Article 57 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code may be entered into by the debtor with
creditors holding at least 60% of the outstanding indebtedness, to be sanctioned (omologato) by the
competent court. An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the
business and accounting data provided by the company and declare and that the agreement is feasible
and, particularly, that it ensures that the indebtedness vis-à-vis non-participating creditors can be fully
satisfied within the following terms in a 120-day term from: (i) the date of sanctioning (omologazione)
of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating
creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the
court; and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and
payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt
restructuring agreement by the court. Pursuant to Article 57 of the Italian Insolvency Code, only a
debtor who is insolvent or facing a state of crisis (as described above) can initiate this process and
request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with
its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its
publication. Creditors and other interested parties may challenge the agreement within 30 days from
the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled with the opposition
(if any), the court will validate (omologare) the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be
appealed within 30 days of its publication pursuant to Article 51 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

The Italian Insolvency Code does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of
the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the debtor or a
third party carrying out the business, or the sale of the business, and may contain refinancing
agreements, moratoria, write offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement
may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Article
58, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code sets the rule for when substantial amendments are
made to the plan. More precisely, in the event of substantial amendments to the plan before the
approval, the report issued by the expert and the consent to the debt restructuring agreement expressed
by creditors shall be renewed. The report shall also be renewed in the event of substantial amendment.
In the event of substantial amendments after the approval, the debtor shall make such amendments as
are appropriate to ensure the implementation of the agreements, by requesting the update of the
certified report issued by the expert having the requirements set forth in Article 57, paragraph 4 of the
Italian Insolvency Code. In this case, the renewed certified report, together with the amended
restructuring plan, shall be published in the companies’ register, giving appropriate notice to the
creditors by registered letter or by certified email (PEC). The parties may file an objection
(opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same.

_The key features of a debt restructuring agreement_

With the petition for the approval by the court of the debt restructuring agreement (or at any time
pending the procedure) the debtor may request to be granted any Measures (e.g. a stay of actions or the


-----

creation by creditors of security interest (unless it is agreed in the debt restructuring agreement) in
relation to pre-existing debts, etc.). Such Measures can also be requested (i) pursuant to Article 54,
paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code, to the court by the debtor pending negotiations with
creditors (i.e., prior to the filing of the petition for approval of the agreement), subject to certain
conditions, or (ii) pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with a pre-petition for
the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code. According to
Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for approval of the
debt restructuring agreement includes the relevant request for Measures, from the date of publication
of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement
and the conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant
Measures). No dispossession of debtor occurs in respect of a debt restructuring agreement, but the court
may appoint a judicial commissioner to oversee the proceedings and must do so in case petitions for
the opening of judicial liquidation are pending, when it is necessary for the protection of the parties
who filed such petitions. It is a court-supervised procedure, which can take from a few months up to
more than a year (the duration of the proceedings are generally influenced by challenges). Creditors
entering into the debt restructuring agreement are not required to receive the same treatment (i.e.,
they are free to reject the proposal and to protect their interests otherwise) and no cram-down is
applicable to third-party non-adhering creditors, who shall be fully re-paid within 120 days from
validation (omologa) of the debt restructuring agreement (if the claims are already due and payable
at such date) or within 120 days from the respective maturity date if such creditors’ claims are not yet
due as of the validation date of such debt restructuring agreement as per respectively Article 57,
paragraph 3 letters a) and b).

The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for
a hearing to be held no earlier of 15 days from the notification of the relevant filing. Pending such
deadline, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the approval. At such hearing,
the court decides upon any opposition and assesses whether the conditions for the approval are met.

Pursuant to the Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code, debtors are entitled to enter into debt
restructuring agreement by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits
belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their status and economic interests)
and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on the non-adhering creditors belonging to
the same category (so called “cram down”).

More in detail, debt restructuring agreements with extended effects (accordi di ristrutturazione ad
_efficacia estesa) provided pursuant to Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code- which were previously_
only permitted in relation to debts owed to banks and financial intermediaries where such debts
represented at least 50% of the total indebtedness - can now be applied to any category of creditors,
provided that, inter alia: (i) all the creditors belonging to the same category have been informed of the
start of the negotiations and have been able to participate in them in good faith and have received
complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation as well
as on the restructuring agreement and its effects; (ii) the agreement provides for the continuation of the
business activity either directly or indirectly pursuant to Article 84 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (iii)
the claims of the consenting creditors belonging to a same category represent at least 75% of all the
claims belonging to the same category; (iv) the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category
to which the effects of the agreement are extended can be satisfied under the agreement for an amount
not lower than the amount they would receive with the judicial liquidation being understood that a
creditor may hold claims in more than one category; and (v) the debtor has notified the agreement,
the application for court approval and the documents attached thereto to the creditors to be crammed
down. The percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the debt restructuring agreement is referred to in
the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione
_negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa._

Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 61, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, a special
provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total
indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of
creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and


-----

economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-participating creditors who are part
of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct
or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. However, in such case the rights
of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain valid.

Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a standstill agreement
(convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and its creditors representing 75% of the
same class would also bind the non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert
meeting the requirements provided under Article 62, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code has
been appointed and certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the
standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii) the fact that the treatment
reserved to non-adhering creditors is at least equal to the one they could obtain in the context of a
judicial winding up, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the
relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations, have been made able to
participate in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s
assets, economic and financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering
crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been
notified of the same.

In no case debt restructuring agreements provided for under Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency
Code and standstill agreements provided under Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code may impose
on the non-adhering creditors, _inter alia, performance of new obligations, the granting of new_
overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization
of new facilities.

Furthermore, Article 60 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the so called facilitated debt
restructuring agreement (“accordi di ristrutturazione agevolati”). Such proceeding, is a particular kind
of debt restructuring agreement which may be entered into with creditors representing as little as
30% of the total indebtedness (instead of the 60% generally required under Article 57, paragraph
1, of the Italian Insolvency Code) provided that the debtor: (i) has waived the standstill on the payment
of non-consenting creditors (usually provided for by law, for a period of 120 days from the court
approval of the agreement or from the maturity date of the relevant obligations, in “ordinary”
restructuring agreements); and (ii) has not previously requested to the court the granting of protective
interim measures on the its assets.

By virtue of Article 59 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to
the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors
maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the
debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise,
debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with nonlimited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will
remain liable as guarantors.

The provision of Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreement
and to the court-supervised compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below.

Pursuant to Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a composition with creditors on
a going concern basis:

(a) the debtor may repay, in accordance with the relevant contractual terms, the installments due
under a loan agreement which is secured by way of a security interest over the assets used in the
business, provided that: (a) at the date of the filing of the application for admission to the
composition with creditors, the debtor has fulfilled its obligations or the court authorizes the
payment of the debt for principal and interest due at that date; and (b) the expert meeting the
requirements set forth in Article 52, paragraph 3, of the Italian Insolvency Code certifies (i)
that such payments are essential for the continuation of the business activity and functional to
ensuring the best satisfaction of the creditors (as already required by Article 100 of the Italian
Insolvency Code) and, (ii) that the secured claims can be fully satisfied with the proceeds of the


-----

liquidation of the asset carried out at market value and that the repayment of the installments
due does not prejudice the rights of the other creditors;

(b) the court may authorize payment of the remuneration due, for the months preceding the filing
of the application for the composition with creditors, to the workers employed in the business
whose continuation is envisaged under the plan.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 73 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in case of revocation of the approval
(omologa), the court, upon the debtor's petition, shall order the conversion to a judicial winding-up
procedure. If the revocation results from acts of fraud (atti in frode ai creditori) or non-performance of
the obligations arising under the debt restructuring agreement, the petition for conversion may also be
proposed by creditors or by the public prosecutor. In case of conversion, the court shall grant additional
time to the debtor aimed at supplementing the documentation and shall act in accordance with Article
270 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

_Court supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (as defined above) and that has not been
declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under
court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby
avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of insolvency proceedings (so called
“concordato preventivo”). Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which
exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount
exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in
an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has
total indebtedness in excess (included debts not yet due) of €0.5 million. Only the debtor can file a
petition with the court for a concordato preventivo with the court based in the location of the debtor’s
main office. The debtor must file the petition together with, among others, a restructuring plan
containing an analytic description of manner and timing of the fulfillment of the proposal and an
independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of
the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is
then published by the debtor in the company’s register by the registry of the court and communicated
to the public prosecutor. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the
_concordato preventivo, preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the_
court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the
_concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing_
creditors. According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, provided that the
petition for the admission to the concordato proceedings includes the relevant request for Measures,
from the date of publication of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence
or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any initiatives
prohibited under the relevant Measures). As already described with reference to debt restructuring
agreements, at any time pending the proceedings, the debtor may request to be granted Measures, which
can also be requested pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with a pre-petition
for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring
and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure
payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors
with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale), including through
extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated
companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments
and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company
making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes (which is mandatory in
certain cases provided under the Article 85 of the Italian Insolvency Code), provided that each class is
composed of creditors having homogeneous legal positions and economic interests; and (iv) different
treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a
proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Save for the provisions


-----

provided for under Article 109 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 86 of the Italian Insolvency
Code has provided that, in the context of a composition with creditors on a going concern basis
(concordato con continuità), the plan may provide for a standstill for the secured creditors, which may
extend up to six months from the date of sanctioning (omologa) of the composition with creditors
proposal for the payment of secured creditors (creditori privilegiati) pursuant to Article 2751-bis of the
Italian Civil Code (i.e. employees, professionals etc.).

Pursuant to Article 84, paragraph 4, the Italian Insolvency Code, in order to strengthen the position of
the unsecured creditors, a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato
_liquidatorio) (i.e., a composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the_
creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that
(i) with the relevant filing for such proceeding, external resources are contributed which increase the
assets available at the time of such filing by at least 10% and (ii) the degraded secured creditors as
well as unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage equal to 20% of their total claims. In this respect,
it should be noted that resources contributed for the purpose of a composition with creditors proposal
with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) may be distributed notwithstanding the provisions
set forth under Articles 2740 and 2741 of the Italian Civil Code provided that such distribution complies
with the 20% requirement set forth above. Resources contributed are considered as “external” when
provided for any reason by the debtor’s shareholders without obligation of repayment or subordination,
in relation to which the plan provides them to be for the sole benefit of the creditors. This provision
does not apply to composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going
concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

Under the composition with creditors, there is no dispossession of the debtor who accordingly retains
management powers under the supervision of a court-appointed official (commissario giudiziale) and
the deputy judge. From the date of the publication of the petition to the date on which the court
sanctions the _concordato preventivo, the debtor is entitled to operate in the ordinary course of its_
business, although extraordinary transactions require the prior written approval of the court. Provided
that the abovementioned steps are taken, during this time, all enforcement actions, precautionary
actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. The
accrual of interests is suspended for the same timeframe, except for claims secured by pledges, liens or
mortgages. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and
mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato
_preventivo is published in the companies’ register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors._
Any act, payment or security executed or created after the filing of the _concordato preventivo_
application and in accordance with its rules and procedures is exempt from claw-back action. The
debtor is also exempt from certain bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles 322, third paragraph
(“preferential bankruptcy”), and 323 (“simple bankruptcy”) of the Italian Insolvency Code, in relation
to acts and payments made in execution of the Composition with Creditors and/or in relation to finance
provided under Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code upon judicial authorization. Claims arising
from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company have super senior priority (prededucibilità)
in the event of a subsequent judicial winding-up (see Statutory priorities below).

For details regarding super senior financing, please refer to the paragraph relating to debt restructuring
agreements.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary
and simplified petition pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code. For sake of clarity,
under Italian Insolvency Code, the simplified petition may be utilized by the debtor also to access a
debt restructuring agreement or a restructuring plan subject to approval by the court (piano di
_ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) or a_ _concordato. The debtor company may file such_
petition, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation
(or the debt restructuring agreement, or the restructuring plan) within a period assigned by the court
_(a) between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one_
possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension
(giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial winding-up proceeding are not pending.
If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may, among other things: (i) appoint a judicial


-----

commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor
has carried out one of the activities under Article 106 of the Italian Insolvency Code (e.g.,
concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent
liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further
verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting
and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. As mentioned above,
filing the simplified petition, the debtor may request the application of Measures.

Pursuant to Article 44, paragraph 1, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the decree setting the term
for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also
relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes
of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a
monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a
monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the
company’s register.

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the simplified petition being declared inadmissible
and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements
are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into judicial winding-up. If the activities
carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the “full”
application, the court may, _ex officio, after hearing the debtor and if appointed the judicial_
commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the
simplified petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed
company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization
to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising
from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company after the filing of the concordato preventivo
petition (including preliminary petition) have super priority (prededucibilità) in case of a subsequent
judicial winding-up.

The _concordato preventivo_ proposal may also provide, _inter alia: (i) the continuation of the_
business by the debtor as going concern; or (ii) the transfer of the business to one or more companies
(concordato con continuità aziendale) as well as for a particular composition with creditors proceeding
through which any assets that are no longer necessary to run the business of the company are liquidated
(concordato misto). According to Article 84, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the
_concordato misto qualifies as a_ _concordato con continuità aziendale, regardless the “portion” of_
business for which going concern is envisaged. In these cases, the plan and the petition for the
_concordato preventivo must fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of_
the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support
which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert must also certify that the
continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent
than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Existing contracts, even if entered with
governmental bodies, are automatically not to be terminated by admission to procedure.

Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the
winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement
may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

Under Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a debtor who files for a _concordato_ pursuant to
Articles 44 and 87 of the Italian Insolvency Code based on business continuity may request the court
to be authorized to pay pre-filing claims relating to the purchase of goods or services if an independent
expert certifies that they are essential for business continuity and to ensure the best satisfaction of
creditors.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice
_delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali)_
and schedules a specific period of time during which creditors can express their vote. During the
implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate
bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge


-----

(who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business).

Article 91 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides that, if the composition with creditors’ plan, includes
an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or the sale of a going concern of the debtor to an identified
third party, the court or the delegated judge shall order that for appropriate publicity to be given to the
offer itself in order to acquire competing offers (offerte concorrenti). If expressions of interest are
received, the court or the delegated judge, by decree, shall order the opening of the competitive
proceeding. Furthermore pursuant to Article 91, paragraph 4, the judicial decree referred above
establishes the procedures for the submission of irrevocable offers, providing that in all cases, among
others, the following is ensured: (a) their comparability, (b) the requirements for the participation of
the bidders, (c) the forms and timing of access to relevant information, (d) any limits on their use, (e)
the manner in which the judicial commissioner must provide them to those who request them, (f) the
manner in which the competitive procedure is to be conducted, (g) the minimum increase in the
consideration to be provided by the subsequent offers, (h) the guarantees to be given by the bidders, (i)
the forms of publicity, and (l) the date of the hearing for the evaluation of the bids if the sale takes
place before the court. With the sale or with the assignment, whichever is earlier, to a person other than
the original bidder identified in the plan, the latter and the debtor are released from their obligations
towards each other and accordingly the debtor shall amend the proposal and plan in accordance with
the outcome of the competitive proceeding.

The concordato preventivo is voted on within the period of time scheduled by the court and must be
approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables
admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, or (b) the
majority of the receivables admitted to vote is reached the majority of the classes. Pursuant to Article
109, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code, in case one creditor holds more than the majority of
receivables admitted to voting, it is also necessary to reach majority by headcount. The concordato
_preventivo_ is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the
proposal. Creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the
_concordato preventivo_ proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the _concordato_
proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to
meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes
to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and
majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian
courts (recent case law has however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by
conflict of interest as could be the case of disenfranchised noteholders to be computed for the purposes
of relevant quora and be admitted to vote, albeit in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled
to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or
the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market
value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case
they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. Among others, (i) the
companies controlling the debtor, controlled by the debtor and those under the control of the entity
controlling the debtor, (ii) the assignees of the claims of the entities under point (i), if the assignment
has been perfected during the year preceding the concordato and (iii) creditors in conflict of interest
are excluded from voting. The court may approve the _concordato preventivo_ (notwithstanding the
circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and
(ii) the court deems that the interests of the non-adhering creditors would be adequately safeguarded
through it compared to other solutions (in particular in comparison with the judicial liquidation). If an
objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in
case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a non-adhering class, entitled to
vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the _concordato preventivo_ if it deems that the relevant
creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo
than would otherwise be the case (including the judicial winding-up).

The court approves the concordato preventivo even in the absence of a vote by the tax authority or by
the social contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza obbligatorie) when
their positive vote is decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in Article 109,


-----

paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code, also on the basis of the result of the report of the
independent expert referred to in Article 88 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal to satisfy the
aforesaid authorities and entities is convenient compared to a judicial liquidation scenario.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 90 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the possibility for
creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the
debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan
(proposta concorrente) to the debtor’s plan - within 30 days prior from the related creditors’ vote on
the debtor’s plan - in a court supervised composition with creditors proceedings (concordato
_preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the_
debtor does not ensure recovery of at least 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari),
considering also that such percentage is reduced to 20% in case the debtor has filed for a composizione
_negoziata provided for pursuant to Article 13 of the Italian Insolvency Code._

Differently from the general rules set out above, pursuant to Article 109 paragraph 5 of the Italian
Insolvency Code, the composition with creditors on a going-concern basis (concordato con continuità),
is approved if all the creditors' classes vote in favor of such composition with creditors arrangement.
In each class, the relevant composition with creditors’ proposal is approved if the majority of the claims
allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted
favorably, provided that the creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same class have
voted. In case of non-approval, Article 112, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code shall apply. In
this respect, it should be noted that secured creditors shall not vote if their claims are satisfied in cash,
in full, within 180 days from the sanctioning (omologa) of the concordato con continuità and provided
that the security interests supporting the related claims remains firm until the winding-up, functional
to their satisfaction. In case of claims of employees or other claims secured under Article 2751-bis of
the Italian Civil Code, the delay is reduced to 30 days from the approval by the court.

Pursuant to Article 112, paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code, after the approval of the
_concordato preventivo_ proposal, non-adhering creditors (or creditors belonging to a non-adhering
class) representing 20% or more of the liabilities may file an opposition (opposizione), challenging the
economic convenience of the plan. In such case, the court has the authority to “cram-down” nonadhering creditors, compelling their acceptance of the plan, if it deems that the proposed treatment of
their claims is equivalent to what they would recover in a judicial winding-up scenario. After the
creditors’ approval, the court approves the composition with creditors and appoints one or more
liquidators in order to execute the approved plan if it has to be realized by way of a transfer of
assets. The court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the
debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required.

Pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Insolvency Code, if the creditors do not approve the concordato
_preventivo, the delegated judge (giudice delegato) shall promptly inform the court which, having_
decided that the appropriate conditions apply, shall declare the opening of the judicial winding-up
proceeding.

The terms and the performance of the outstanding contracts which have been entered into, from time
to time, by the debtor are not automatically affected by the concordato preventivo proceeding and
normally continue pending the procedure, any agreement to the contrary being ineffective. However,
pursuant to Article 97 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the debtor may request the competent court to
be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente
_eseguiti) if the continuation of such agreements is inconsistent with the prospects and the execution of_
the composition with creditors’ plan, except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope
of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real
estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad
_uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may_
be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the _concordato_
_preventivo_ or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the
procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of
time (a) between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only


-----

one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension
(giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial liquidation proceeding are pending,
renewable just once. When the composition proposal together with the relevant plan have been
submitted, the suspension may also be authorized by the court for a further duration, which, however,
may not exceed thirty days from the date of the decree opening the procedure, which may not be
further extended. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification
equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification
would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the concordato preventivo procedure.

Pursuant to Articles 119 and 120 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a breach of the
composition with creditors plan or fraud, provided that the relevant requirements are met, the
_concordato can be terminated or annulled, as the case may be, upon petition of one or more of the_
creditors and the judicial winding-up may follow, at the behest of the relevant court. if the composition
with creditors is implemented, terms and conditions of payments are amended as per the concordato
proposal, and the debtor may return to its usual operations (if the assets of the company are still in his
possession). _Concordato preventivo_ is compulsory for all creditors prior to the publication of the
application in the companies’ register. However, creditors retain without prejudice their rights against
co-debtors and guarantors of the debtor.

In case of non-minor breaches, the concordato may be terminated by each of the creditors or the judicial
commissioner (in case of petition by one or more of the creditors). The relevant lawsuit must be brought
within one year from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the
_concordato itself. The concordato may also be annulled upon request of the judicial commissioner or_
of one or more creditors in case a portion of the assets of the debtor has been concealed or the liabilities
have been willfully exaggerated. The relevant lawsuit must be brought within six months from the
discovery of the concealment/exaggeration and, in any event, within two years from the deadline
originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the concordato itself.

_Available financing forms under the Italian Insolvency Code_

The enactment of the Italian Insolvency Code did not change the main features of the previous legal
framework set out in the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The aim at preserving the value of the company as a
going concern and maximizing creditor’s repayment are the main goals both of the previous legal
framework and the Italian Insolvency Code.

However, the new provisions under the Italian Insolvency Code remove some uncertainties and
clarifies some debated issues.

In addition, the provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law focused mainly on the perspective of
creditors already having claims against the company to avoid that the expectations of recovery of such
claims were reduced due to the potential considerable increase in predeductible claims and, to this
extent, granted a preeminent role to the independent expert together with the court authorization
procedures. Unlike the former legal framework, the new provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code
focus more on preserving the business value of the distressed company as a going concern by
strengthening the key role of the financing of the debtor in the context of the relevant proceedings.

The provision of Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreement
and to the court-supervised compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo).

The main features of the provisions concerning different available financings under the Italian
Insolvency Code are set out below.

_Interim financing - Article 99 Paragraph 1 to 4 Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the context of
restructuring transactions on a going concern basis, also in cases in which business continuity is
maintained exclusively in a view of liquidation, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of
the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 57 (or Article 60 or 61) of the Italian Insolvency
Code or a petition pursuant to Article 87 of the Italian Insolvency Code (in relation to the court

-----

supervised composition with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the debtor, if so
expressly requested to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness, subject
to the court’s authorization with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that:
(i) the petition specifies (A) the purpose of the financing; (B) that the debtor is unable to otherwise
obtain the required funds and (C) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and
irreparable prejudice to the going concern or to the proceedings; and (ii) the expert appointed by the
debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione),
declares that the new financing are functional to the continuity of the business activities until the
sanctioning (omologa) of the relevant insolvency proceedings or to the opening of the proceedings or
to conduct them and, in any case, are aimed at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the
creditors. The expert report is not necessary in case the court recognizes that there is the urgent need
to avoid an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern. In the event of the subsequent
admission of the debtor to the judicial winding-up proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the
aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case the
petition or the expert report contain false data or omit important information or in case the debtor
performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that
who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date of
the disbursement.

_Bridge Financings - Article 99 Paragraph 5 Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Article 99, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, financings (together with the related
claims) granted, in any form, in view of (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning
(omologazione) of a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised composition with creditors
(concordato preventivo) (finanza ponte), may be granted such priority status provided that (i) they meet
the requirements of Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2 (described above), and (ii) it is envisaged by the
relevant plan or agreement and that such priority status is expressly provided for by the court at the
time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement
or the approval of the concordato preventivo. The indebtedness under such financing option may be
secured, subject to the court’s authorization, with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning
claims.

_Implementation financing - Article 101 Italian Insolvency Code_

In restructuring transactions on a going concern basis, pursuant to Article 101 of the Italian Insolvency
Code, any financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a debt restructuring agreement (or a courtsupervised pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors) sanctioned by the competent court and
expressly provided for in the relevant plan, enjoy super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case
of subsequent judicial liquidation, save for the below (such status also applies to financing granted by
shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing, unless the lender has become a shareholder of the
debtor as implementation of the debt restructuring agreement or of the supervised pre-bankruptcy
composition with creditors, as in such case the priority status is afforded to 100% of the financing)
according with the provisions set forth in Article 221 of Italian Insolvency Code. In the event of the
subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial winding-up proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the
aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case the
composition plan or the debt restructuring agreement, on the basis of an assessment to be made at the
time of the relevant filing, results to be based upon false data or omission of relevant information or in
case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the judicial
receiver proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such
circumstances at the date of the disbursement.

_The shareholders' financing – Art. 102 Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Art. 102, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code super senior ranking status also applies
to any financings made available by shareholders in any form (including any guarantee facility or
granting counter-indemnities) up to 80% of their amount.


-----

Paragraph 2 of Article 102 of the Italian Insolvency Code clarifies that, to the extent the financing is
made available by an entity becoming a shareholder in the context of and by way of implementation of
a composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement, all the claims deriving from such
financings benefit of super senior ranking status and the 80% threshold limitation set out in Paragraph
1 does not apply.

_Super senior ranking - Art. 99 Paragraph 6 and 101 Paragraph 2 Corporate Crisis and Insolvency_
_Code_

Super senior ranking (prededucibilità) of the claims is the most relevant feature of bridge financings,
interim financings and implementation financings as described in the paragraphs above.

Pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the claims deriving from such financings are
expressly qualified as super senior by law and by Article 6(2) of the Italian Insolvency Code which
clarifies that their super senior ranking natures continues in the context of any subsequent insolvency
or enforcement proceedings (including in a judicial liquidation or any so-called minor proceedings).

As already explained above, super senior ranking nature of such financings will be excluded in case of
acts of fraud (which may be relevant also in the context of debt restructuring agreements).

Such limit to super senior ranking is regulated differently for interim financings and bridge financings
on the one side and for the implementation financings on the other side.

More specifically, for interim financings or bridge financings false data or omission of relevant
information are relevant when found by the court in the request for the incurrence of the financings or
the attestation of the independent expert, whilst for implementation financings such elements are
relevant when on included in plan underlying the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring
agreement.

With reference to interim financings and bridge financings, Article 99 Paragraph 6 of the Italian
Insolvency Code provides that, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation, such financings (although
authorized by the court in the context of the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring
agreement) do not benefit from super senior ranking when it is proved (jointly) that:

(i) the request or the independent expert report contains false data or omits relevant information,
or when the debtor has committed acts to defraud creditors in order to obtain the authorization;
and

(ii) the receiver proves that the entities who provided the financing, at the date of issuance, knew
the aforementioned circumstances.

With reference to implementation financings, the relevant provisions are set out in Article 101
Paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code providing that such financings do not benefit from the super
senior ranking, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation (alternatively):

(i) when, based on an assessment to be made at the time of filing of the petition for the opening of
the proceeding, the plan underlying the composition with creditors or debt restructuring
agreement turns out to be based on false data or on the omission of relevant information; or

(ii) when the debtor has carried out acts of fraud towards its creditors and the receiver proves that
the lenders providing the financings were aware of such circumstances at the time of the
establishment of the financings.

_Restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione)_

An important novelty concerns the crisis regulation procedures governed by Title IV of Part I of the
Italian Insolvency Code, is the new figure of the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di


-----

_ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) (the so-called “PRO”, the rules of which are set out in the_
new Articles 64-bis and 64-ter of the Italian Insolvency Code).

This new tool, takes the form of a restructuring framework that may disregard the distribution rules of
regular insolvency proceedings but can be enacted provided that strict requirements are met. In this
regard, it should be noted that recourse to this instrument will be reserved for a debtor in crisis or
insolvent that plans to satisfy its creditors by dividing them into classes according to homogeneous legal
positions and economic interests. This instrument allows the plan’s proceeds to be distributed even in
derogation of the principle of “par condicio creditorum” (i.e. the equal treatment of creditors), provided
that the proposal is approved by unanimous consent of the classes. A judgement of admissibility is
provided for by the court, which is called upon to assess the proposal’s timeliness and to verify the
correctness of the class formation criteria.

Application for the approval by the court of a restructuring plan must follow the steps of the common
framework applicable to all restructuring tools and frameworks (i.e. concordato preventivo, debt
restructuring agreement and also to judicial winding-up). The regulation of the restructuring plan
subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), from the date of
submission of the application until its approval, is based on the model of the negotiated crisis settlement:
the entrepreneur maintains the ordinary and extraordinary management of the company in the prevailing
interest of the creditors under the supervision of the court commissioner. The debtor is, in any case,
allowed to amend the application at any time, formulating the proposal of composition (concordato
_preventivo). In that case, the time limit for approval is shortened. Similarly, the debtor that has filed an_
application for composition with creditors may amend the application by applying for approval of the
restructuring plan provided that the application is made before voting commences. In each class, the
proposal is approved if a majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if two-thirds
of the claims of the voting creditors have voted in favor, provided that creditors holding at least half of
the total claims of the same class have voted. The court will approve the restructuring plan in the event
of approval by all classes. If a dissenting creditor objects to the proposal, the court will approve and
homologate the restructuring plan if the proposal satisfies the claim to a not lesser extent than the one
resulting from a judicial liquidation. A creditor that has not objected to the lack of convenience in its
observations may not file an objection referred before, unless it proves such the lack of objection was
due to a cause not attributable to it. In summary the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di
_ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) thus represents for the debtor an opportunity instrument which_
minimizes the admissibility phase, providing greater freedom of action, but requiring the approval of
all classes of creditors in order to be effectively approved.

Against the judgment of the court ruling on the approval of the restructuring plan subject to homologation
_(piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), the parties may file an appeal to the competent court_
of appeal within the term of 30 days from the notification of the relevant judgement of the court.

_Court-supervised composition for small debtors_

The Italian Insolvency Code provides for a simplified court-supervised composition in case the debtor
does not meet the dimensional requirements to access other restructuring tools.

Procedural steps and effects do essentially mimic those of the concordato preventivo, but it entails the
involvement of the board for crisis settlement (organismo di risoluzione della crisi), which assists the
debtor in preparing the paperwork and filing the petition, and performs the activities and duties which,
in a concordato preventivo are prerogatives of the judicial commissioner.

_Judicial winding-up (liquidazione giudiziale)_

The judicial winding-up (liquidazione giudiziale) is a court-supervised procedure for the liquidation of
an insolvent company’s assets and for the distribution of the related proceeds. It results in the
company’s liquidation. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, also
evidenced by defaults and/or external elements, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly
meet its obligations as they come due.

The judicial winding-up is declared by the competent court and is applicable only to commercial


-----

enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has
had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three
preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2
million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts
not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million. Pursuant to Article 37 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the request
to commence the judicial liquidation of the debtor company’s assets can be filed by (i) the debtor
company itself, (ii) the administrative bodies and authorities that have control and supervisory
functions over the company, (iii) by one or more of the debtor’s creditors and (iv) in certain cases, by
the public prosecutor.

Upon the commencement of judicial winding-up proceedings, amongst other things:

- subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims
within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may
enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as secured claims.
Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and
expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of
the debtor’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it
has obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the
judicial receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize
the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision;

- under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon
as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds
of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any
relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction
of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with
all of the debtor’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with
the court authorization. After hearing the judicial receiver (curatore) and the creditors’
committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in
his or her decision;

- the payments of all debts and liabilities of the debtor and all the acts, transactions, payments
made or received by the insolvent debtor are immediately suspended and formalities with third
parties that have been carried out after the declaration of insolvency are not effective as regards
the creditors of the debtor (Article 145 of Italian Insolvency Code);

- the debtor is dispossessed, and the administration of the debtor and the management of its
assets are transferred to the judicial receiver (curatore). The debtor may no longer validly act in
court as claimant or defendant in relation to the assets (Article 142 of the Italian Insolvency
Code). The judicial receiver is vested with such powers upon the authorization of the delegated
judge. However, all pending proceedings in which the debtor is involved are automatically
stayed from the date the adjudication is issued and need to be re-initiated by or against the
judicial receiver;

- the beginning of the judicial winding-up involves the cessation of all the activities of the
company with a view to a sale of all assets. However, continuation of business may be authorized
by the court if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors.
If the competent court authorizes the continuation of the business (esercizio provvisorio
_dell’impresa), the management of the business is entrusted to the judicial receiver (who may in_
turn avail himself of qualified third parties for this purpose);

- certain payments made, security interests given or transactions entered into by the debtor in a
certain period before the debtor’s submission to a judicial winding-up procedure (varying
from six months to two years) can be set aside and clawed back if certain conditions are met
(provided for pursuant to Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code);

- any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after


-----

(and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the
proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors;
and

- the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the insolvency
declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the
general rule is that the judicial receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts
where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts
are subject to specific rules expressly provided for the Italian Insolvency Code.

In order to overcome the uncertainty that may predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file
a written petition requiring the Court to give the judicial receiver (curatore) a deadline of no more than
60 days; within such deadline, the receiver must decide to enter into the agreement or withdraw from
it. Upon expiration of the deadline without the judicial receiver having replied to the counterparty’s
request, the pending agreement is deemed terminated. Although the general rule is that the judicial
receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed,
certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code.

Judicial winding-up proceedings, as per the former bankruptcy proceedings under Italian Bankruptcy
Law, are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed judicial receiver, a deputy judge (giudice
_delegato) and a creditors’ committee (comitato dei creditori). The judicial receiver is not a_
representative of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the
satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory
priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in
cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate property.

Furthermore, the parties of a judicial winding-up proceeding as well as any interested party, may file
an appeal (opposizione) to the decree closing the judicial winding-up proceeding within 30 days after
having been notified of the same.

- **Composition with creditors in judicial liquidation (concordato nella liquidazione**
**_giudiziale). Pursuant to Article 240 of the Italian Insolvency Code, judicial liquidation_**
proceedings can terminate prior to the actual judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) of
the debtor, through a proposal for a composition with creditors in judicial liquidation. By way
of preliminary note, such agreement occurring in the context of a judicial liquidation
proceeding (i) replaced the former proceeding defined as “concordato fallimentare”, a
composition with creditors agreement occurring in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding
(fallimento) formerly provided for under Article 124, paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law and (ii) should be kept distinct from the concordato preventivo, which is an independent
insolvency proceeding. This particular composition with creditor agreement arrangement
benefits in a certain way both the debtor as well as the creditors, in fact while the former is
released of the debts falling into the relevant plan also regaining free disposal of his assets, the
latter is satisfied faster and to a greater extent than they would have been with the full
completion of the judicial liquidation process pertaining to the debtor’s assets.

The creditor, a third party or the debtor himself formulates a proposal having as its object a
“plan” to satisfy creditors, including preferential creditors, in full or in part. In case the
_concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is proposed by the debtor, such proposal, inter alia,_
(i) shall be filed after 1 year from the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding and (ii)
shall provide for the contribution by the debtor of resources that increase the value of the
debtor’s assets by at least 10%.

Such proposal shall be submitted to the competent judge, shall then be approved by the
creditors and finally by the court. In case the court’s decree approving the _concordato nella_
_liquidazione giudiziale becomes final (definitivo), the court declares the judicial liquidation to_
be closed and terminated, initiating the enactment phase of the concordato nella liquidazione
_giudiziale. In the context of a concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale, the competent court_
supervises both the proposal and execution phases while the judicial receiver (curatore), once


-----

the liquidation is closed, loses his management functions and retains only supervisory duties
over the fulfillment of the terms and the conditions of the arrangement obligations arising from
or in connection with the aforementioned concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale.

Pursuant to Article 240, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal may provide
for:

(i) the division of creditors into classes, according to homogeneous legal position and

economic interests.

Under the relevant provision, such division is not mandatory but discretionary, provided
two criteria for the class identification: (a) legal position, i.e., the nature of the claim, e.g.,
unsecured or preferential and (b) the homogeneous economic interests. In this respect, the
Italian Insolvency Code requires for the criteria and rationale for the division into classes
to be expressly stated in order to avoid the distorted use of class formation, put in place
for the sole purpose of obtaining the approval of the abovementioned proposal;

(ii) differential treatment between creditors belonging to different classes, indicating the

reasons of such differences;

(iii) the restructuring of the financial indebtedness of the debtor as well as the satisfaction of

claims in any form possible, by way of example:

   - by assignment of assets;

   - by assumption (accollo);

   - by means of other extraordinary transactions, including the assignment to creditors (as
well as to companies in which they have an interest), of shares, quotas or bonds,
including those convertible into shares or other financial instruments and debt
securities.

It should be noted that a special feature of the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is
the option to provide that secured creditors may not be satisfied in full. However, it is
necessary for the plan to provide for their satisfaction to a non-lesser extent than that the
one which can be realized, by reason of preferential placement, from the relevant proceeds
in the event of a judicial liquidation, having regard to the market value attributable to the
assets or rights over which the cause of pre-emption exists.

The concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale proposal must be approved by the creditors’
committee and the creditors holding the simple majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes
are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in the majority of the classes). However,
in the event of dissent by more than one creditor’s class, a cram-down may occur (i.e. in
case the court decides to approve the _concordato - despite a creditor belonging to a_
dissenting class contests the appropriateness of the proposal - if it finds that the claims
can be satisfied by the concordato to a non-lesser extent than the practicable alternatives.
Final court confirmation and sanctioning (omologazione) is also required.

Finally, once approved and sanctioned (omologato) by the court the _concordato nella_
_liquidazione giudiziale_ is mandatory:

(i) for all existing creditors prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding; and

(ii) for creditors who have not applied for the admission to the judicial liquidation estate,

to whom the guarantees or the security interests given in the _concordato nella_
_liquidazione giudiziale by third parties do not extend._

With the termination of the judicial liquidation - as a consequence of the sanctioning decree
(decreto di omologa), which pursuant to Article 247 of the Italian Insolvency Code may be
challenged and appealed within 30 days from its notification - the debtor returns “in bonis”


-----

and enjoys the renewed availability of its assets.

- **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Insolvency**
Code may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain
other EU jurisdictions. The proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following
order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency
proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure) as better identified in Article 6 of the Italian
Insolvency Code; (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured
creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest
priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential
creditors, including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of
rescue or interim financing) the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security
administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order
of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in
most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari),
pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under
Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the debtor’s estate are distributed according to legal
rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by
proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on
equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments
such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be
enforceable against an Italian judicial liquidation estate to the extent they are inconsistent with
the priorities provided by law). The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to
when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire debtor’s estate or part thereof,
or from a single asset.

In particular, pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in addition to claims expressly
qualified as “prededucibili” under Italian law, among others, the following claims are
“prededucibili”:

(i) claims relating to expenses and fees for services rendered by the business crisis settlement
body;

(ii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing for the approval of a
restructuring plan subject to homologation, the debt restructuring agreements and for the
application for protective measures, to the extent of 75% of the assessed claim and
provided that the abovementioned plan or agreements are approved and homologated;

(iii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing of for a court supervised

composition with creditors procedure as well as the filing of the related proposal and the
plan accompanying it, within the limits of 75% of the ascertained claims and provided
that the proceedings are opened pursuant to Article 47 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

(iv) claims legally arisen in connection with insolvency proceedings for the management of
the debtor’s assets and the continuation of the business of the company as well as arising
from the professional services required by the related bodies.

- **Avoidance powers in insolvency. A fundamental principle of the Italian Insolvency Code**
is the equal treatment of all creditors (“par condicio creditorum”), according to which, absent
statutory priorities or security right, no creditor may be paid a higher percentage of his claim
than other creditors. A consequence of this principle is not only that the payment of debts by the
judicial receiver is strictly regulated, but also that all transactions effected by the debtor over
the previous year (or, in certain cases, over the previous six months) are scrutinized and
potentially unwound as preferential.

Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under
Italian law that may give rise, _inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of_
security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of insolvency. The key avoidance
provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made below market value, preferential


-----

transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under
Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in judicial
winding-up compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

In insolvency proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Insolvency Code
provides for a claw-back period of up to two years (six months in certain circumstances) and a
two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. In the context of extraordinary
administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or
five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Insolvency Code distinguishes between acts or
transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable
at the request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below.

- **Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code,**
subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are
ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor after the filing to the relevant court
followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up procedure or within the two years preceding
the opening of such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction which is
ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation
estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the
insolvency proceeding, without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be
sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated
judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, (A)
payments of receivables falling due on the day of the of the judicial declaration of opening of
the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after the filing of the
application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding or in the prior two-year period
; and (B) payments made by the debtor with respect to any intercompany loan within one year
prior to a judicial winding-up declaration (or after the filing of the application followed by the
opening of the winding-up proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors.

- **Acts that may be avoided at the request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner. The**
following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be
clawed back (revocati) _vis-à-vis the debtor as provided for by Article 166 of the Italian_
Insolvency Code and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had
no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was
entered into:

(i) onerous transactions carried out after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial

liquidation proceeding or in the previous year, where the value of the debt or the obligations
undertaken by the debtor exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or
promised to the debtor;

(ii) payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor which were not paid in cash or

by other customary means of payment which were carried out after the filing followed by
the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the previous year;

(iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the

judicial liquidation proceeding or in the year prior, in order to secure pre-existing debts
which were not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and

(iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the

judicial liquidation proceeding or in the six months prior in order to secure pre-existing
debts which had already fallen due at the time the new security was granted.

Furthermore, payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous
transactions and/or granting of priority rights/security interests for debts simultaneously created
(event those of third parties) may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective, if the
judicial receiver proves that the other party knew of the debtor’s state of insolvency and if made
by the debtor after the filing of the petition followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation or
during the prior six months.


-----

(c) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:

(i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according
to market practice;

(ii) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and
permanently reduce the entity’s debt towards the bank;

(iii) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of

the Italian Civil Code, in force as the date of this Offering Memorandum, made for
a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main
residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of
kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the
enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency
declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the
commencement of such activity have been carried out therein;

(iv) transactions entered into, payments made or guarantees granted with respect to the

debtor’s goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a _piano_
_attestato di risanamento_ (see “Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati
_di risanamento) pursuant to Articles 56 or 284 of the Italian Insolvency Code”_
above);

(v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee or security interests granted
in the context of a court supervised composition with creditors (concordato
_preventivo), of a restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di_
_ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) provided for pursuant to Article 64-bis_
of the Italian Insolvency Code or of sanctioned debt restructuring agreements with
creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologati) and/or transactions
entered into, payments made and security interests legitimately granted by the
debtor after the filing of the application for a _concordato preventivo or of an_
_accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti (see above);_

(vi) remuneration payments to the entity’s employees and consultants concerning work

carried out by them; and

(vii) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date,

with respect to services necessary for access to a pre-judicial liquidation
restructuring framework (see below under “pre-judicial liquidation restructuring
_frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società)”)_
or to other insolvency procedures provided for pursuant to the Italian Insolvency
Code.

Pursuant to Article 170 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the limitation period for initiating clawback action proceedings is three years from the opening of the judicial liquidation procedure or,
if earlier, five years from the act or transaction to be clawed back. In case judicial liquidation is
commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according
to Article 170, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated
backward from the date in which such petition is filed. In addition, in certain cases, the judicial
receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor be declared ineffective within the
ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian
Civil Code. In this respect, under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand
that transactions whereby the entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights
be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the debtor was aware of such
prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was
originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor for the purpose of
prejudicing the creditors) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with
a third person, the third person was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was
entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person participated


-----

in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

The Italian Insolvency Code provides special regimes on preferences and avoidances of intragroup transactions. Under Article 290 of the Italian Insolvency Code the limitation period of
initiating intra-group claw-back actions (referring to acts and transactions entered into by
companies belonging to the same group that jeopardize the creditors’ interest) is extended to five
years from the filing for judicial winding-up declaration.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a
“simplified” claw-back action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put
in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its
creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant
assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant
(fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without
consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so
called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement
action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser. Finally, as noted
above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various
national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the
European Union.

- **Adequate organizational, administrative and accounting corporate structures. One of the**
main novelties included in the Italian Insolvency Code concerns the definition of the
organizational, administrative and accounting structures of a company which are deemed to be
adequate under Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, required by the applicable regulations for
the purpose of timely detection of the state of crisis and the undertaking of suitable initiatives by
the debtor. Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code requires the entrepreneur to adopt an
appropriate organizational structure in accordance with Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code,
for the purpose of timely detection of the crisis of the company as well as the timely undertaking
of suitable initiatives to overcome the crisis and recover business continuity. However, neither
the aforementioned Article 3, in its current wording, nor Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, as
amended by the Italian Insolvency Code, contains a precise description of the parameters,
conditions and characteristics that are deemed to be necessary/needed for the definition and
especially for the identification of “adequate structures”.

In this regard, Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code precisely enunciates, on the one hand, the
purposes to which the measures and structures must aim in order to be considered as adequate
for the timely detection of the crisis and, on the other hand, the relevant warning signs in relation
to the same. In this respect, it is stipulated that, for the purpose of the timely detection of the
company’s state of crisis, the measures and structures deemed to be adequate should make it
possible to:

(i) detect any imbalances of an equity or economic-financial nature, related to the specific
characteristics of the company as well as to the business activity carried out by the debtor;

(ii) verify the non-sustainability of debts and the absence of prospects for business continuity
for the next twelve months as well as the warning signs identified by Article 3, paragraph
4 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

(iii) derive the information necessary to follow the detailed checklist and conduct the practical

test for the reasonable pursuit of the debtor’s financial recovery.

For the sake of completeness and as set out above, it should also be noted that Article 3,
paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides an exact indication of the warning signs,
identified, inter alia, as follows:

(i) the existence of payroll debts overdue for at least 30 days equal to more than half of the
total monthly payroll amount;

(ii) the existence of receivables owed to suppliers that are at least 90 days past due in an


-----

amount greater than the amount of receivables that are not past due;

(iii) the existence of exposures to banks and other financial intermediaries that have been past

due for more than 60 days or have exceeded the limit of credit facilities obtained in any
form for at least 60 days provided that they represent in the aggregate at least 5% of the
total exposures; and

(iv) the existence of one or more exposures to certain public institutions listed under Article
25-novies of the Italian Insolvency Code.

_Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (Amministrazione Straordinaria delle_
_Grandi Imprese in Stato di Insolvenza)_

The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and
commercial enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be
eligible, companies must be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have
employed at least 200 employees in the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure,
and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and twothirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its last financial year. The procedure may
be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor. The same rules
set forth for judicial winding-up proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims
largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those
credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary
administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an administrative phase.

**_Judicial Phase._** In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission
criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial
receivers (commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a
business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver submit(s) a report to the court (within 30 days)
together with an opinion from the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (the “Ministry”). The
court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the procedure or place it into judicial
winding-up.

**_Administrative Phase. If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the_**
administrative phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare
a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within
one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the
company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the
“Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors (concordato). The plan must be
approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). In
addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition
and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon
successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail,
the company will be declared insolvent.

_Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies (Ristrutturazione Industriale di Grandi Imprese_
_in Stato di Insolvenza)_

Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian
Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano
_procedure.” It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same_
provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For
example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the
court commences the administrative phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have
at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt


-----

(including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is
taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the
declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then
appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on
the company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit
a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan
must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal
or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company insolvent and open
judicial winding-up proceedings.

_Compulsory Administrative Winding-Up (Liquidazione Coatta Amministrativa)_

A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), provided for pursuant
to Article 293 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code, is only available for public interest entities such
as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions,
none of which can be wound up pursuant to judicial liquidation proceedings, save for a different
indication under Italian law. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private
sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is
liquidated not by the court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in
which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant
entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect
of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of
the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions).

The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario
_liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company_ by the relevant governmental authority (e.g., the
Bank of Italy or the Ministry of Economic Development, which are competent for the filing of an
application for a declaration of insolvency with the subsequent opening of the compulsory
administrative winding-up proceeding). The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee
(comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the court under the other
insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The
effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under insolvency
proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for
insolvency proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a
compulsory administrative winding-up.

_Common rules for pre-judicial liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della_
_crisi e dell’insolvenza della società)_

In order to facilitate access and filing of restructuring procedures by the Italian companies, Articles
120-bis and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code have been enacted, introducing a set of rules applicable
to all pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e
_dell’insolvenza). Among other things, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 2 of the Italian_
Insolvency Code and the purposes of a successful restructuring, the plan may provide for “any
_modification of the articles of association of the debtor company, including capital increases and_
_reductions, including with limitation or exclusion of the option right and other modifications that_
_directly affect the shareholders' participation rights, as well as for mergers, demergers and_
_transformations”. Shareholders, who may no longer have an interest in the company, are prevented_
from hindering the restructuring or even one of its stages. For this reason, pursuant to Article 120-bis,
paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the shareholders, while retaining a right to
information in relation to both the initiation and the progress of the restructuring process, may not
remove the directors without just cause, as is the case for the statutory auditors of joint stock companies,
also in light of the fact that under the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code it is not considered as


-----

being just cause for directors’ removal, the filing for access to the pre-judicial liquidation restructuring
tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza) when the related legal conditions and
requirements are met. However, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 5, shareholders representing at
least 10% of the filing company’s corporate capital may make a competing proposal.

The plan may provide for the formation of one class of shareholders or several classes if there are
shareholders to whom different rights are granted by the by-laws, including as a result of the changes
provided for in the plan. The formation of classes is, however, mandatory if the plan provides for
changes that directly affect the shareholders’ participation rights and, in any case, for large companies
and companies with widespread capital. In this context, special conditions for approval of the
arrangement are set out pursuant to Article 120-quater of the Italian Insolvency Code when and if the
plan provides for shareholder attributions. Specific rules are then provided to ensure that creditors’
interests are protected in all cases in which the restructuring tool envisages shareholders to retain a
participation in the company with a certain value.

Article 120-quinquies of the Italian Insolvency Code, regulates the execution phase of such measure.
In order to avoid any obstructive attitude of the shareholders towards the approval of the restructuring
tool, this provision expressly excludes the necessity for their approval and/or resolution on the
implementation of such restructuring tool, by generally attributing the relevant powers to the directors
or more specifically to the competent court, in relation to any amendment to the debtor’s by-laws which

- being specifically provided for by the plan - do not require any discretionary resolution. Finally, it is
stipulated that changes in the corporate structure resulting from the implementation of a pre-judicial
liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza) shall not be
considered as and constitute cause for the termination or amendment of any agreement entered into by
the debtor with third parties.

Articles 284 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code contain specific rules regarding (i) the access of a
group to one of the pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e
_dell’insolvenza) aiming at unifying – to the extent possible – the relevant proceedings; (ii) liability_
lawsuits available to the receiver; and (iii) subordination of claims.

_Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer_

In a judicial winding-up proceeding, the Italian Insolvency Code provides for a claw-back period of up
to two years (six months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver
can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code
ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria).

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into
insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure
the Collateral and any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges
by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under
the rules of avoidance or claw-back (revocatoria) provided for pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code
and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor
made during a certain legally specified suspect period. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions
made by the debtor within the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation
proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation, at below market value
(i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the
consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in
kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is
entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that
it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security
granted during the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding
or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation with respect to pre-existing debts
due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s


-----

insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable
obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured
obligations during the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation
proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation, if the judicial receiver
proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. In case judicial liquidation is
commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according to
Article 170, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated backward from
the date in which such petition is filed. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include
those contemplated by a Guarantor’s Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security
Documents by a guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights
granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant Security
Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent
estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the
benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security
documents.

It should be noted that: (i) under Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited
exceptions, all transactions carried out by the debtor for no consideration are ineffective _vis-a-vis_
creditors if entered into by the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening of
the judicial winding-up procedure or within the two years preceding the opening of such insolvency
proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian
Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by operation of law upon registration
(trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding, without needing to wait for
the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge
the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under Article 164 of the Italian
Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the of the judicial declaration
of opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after the filing of the
application followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up proceedings insolvency declaration or
in the prior two-year period; and B) payments made by the debtor with respect to any intercompany
loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration (or after the filing of the application
followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors.

In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the
various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the
European Union.

_Certain Limitations on Enforcement_

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming,
especially in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the
enforcement process in comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be
familiar. The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to
liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been
balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred
along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees
and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to
potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy or judicial liquidation receiver or by other creditors
under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of (i) Italian bankruptcy law (i.e. Royal
Decree No. 267 of March 16[th] 1942, as amended and supplemented from time to time, the “Italian
Bankruptcy Law”) and/or (ii) Italian Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency
avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during the suspect period. For a more detailed
explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario,
see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Laws Considerations— Judicial Winding-Up (liquidazione


-----

_giudiziale)” and “Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer” below. If challenged_
successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received
must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee
is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not
be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply
and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the
noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in
general may be subject to, among others, the following aspects:

- the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating
to or affecting the rights of creditors;

- an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the
availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court;

- with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive),
each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer
to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article
1460 of the Italian Civil Code;

- claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of
Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze)
or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;

- pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the
correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or
fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable;

- where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter
in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such
opinion is based on reasonable grounds;

- the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may
be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione
_necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to_
Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the
application of such legal concepts under Italian law;

- there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement
or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or
instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would
survive such judgment might not be held to do so;

- enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del
_diritto);_

- the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument
may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation
pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;


-----

- any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal,
invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in
order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the
interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following
the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

- an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for
the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian
Civil Code are satisfied;

- an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial
obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest
being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

- in case of bankruptcy (filed or pending before July 15, 2022) or a judicial liquidation, a receiver is
appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the court and creditors’
committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the
enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the
relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by
the court or, in case of judicial liquidation, to have the pledged assets assigned at a fair market value
returning any excess to the judicial liquidation estate; the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by
a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment
or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/attachment, at the date of the
notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to
accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred
in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding or bankruptcy/judicial liquidation proceedings;

- in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment
to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable
date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of
ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the
relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of
witnessing on the document;

- there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning
advance waivers or forfeitures;

- the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented
by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the
violation of mandatory provisions;

- penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

- any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian
company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among
others, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of applicable remuneration (including interest, default
interest, fees, charges, expenses and other costs and any other form of compensation related to the
Notes) exceeding the thresholds permitted under the Italian Usury Law and related implementing
rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest
which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according
to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the
debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months
based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian
Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the Italian Banking Act )) may not be enforceable;


-----

- if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other
parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties
as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement;

- Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or
litigation;

- a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the secured creditor
from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant
pledge; and

- in case of bankruptcy (to the extent applicable after July 15, 2022) or judicial liquidation of the
grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to
any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding or in case of a judicial
liquidation the pledged assets can also be assigned to secured creditors at a fair market value and,
as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the
pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on
the pledged quotas/shares.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action
can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter
enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets,
in order to seek a claw- back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Articles 2901 and
following of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting
creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to
the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement
and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following
findings:

- that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting
creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was
fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

- that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if
the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in
the fraudulent design.

**Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Security Interests Under Italian**
**Law**

**_Corporate Benefit_**

Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting
of a guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws
and by its by-laws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit,
corporate authorization and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a security interest or a
guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or
restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered.

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest)
must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being
provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable
legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case-by-case basis and its existence is
a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit
is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain


-----

circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs
may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for downstream security or guarantee
(i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial obligations of direct or
indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of upstream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted
to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor)
granted by an entity incorporated under the laws of Italy depends on the existence of a real and adequate
benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can
be proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such
guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for
the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form
of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions
featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and,
therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be
challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. The general rule is that the risk assumed
by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct
or indirect economic benefit to it.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting
a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected
by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors
may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors
of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts
carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory
provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil
liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having
knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction
(including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and
void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such
third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream
guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity
within the meaning of Article 106 of the Italian Banking Act, whose exercise is exclusively demanded
to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian
Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this
respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of
the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company
for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted
financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning
of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same
entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed
entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to
a restricted financial activity.

**_Financial Assistance_**

In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability
which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the
case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful
for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or
otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those
of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for


-----

refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas
or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance
provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and
void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company.

In the light of the above, each of the Company and Overlord Bidco as Guarantors shall not undertake
to guarantee financial indebtedness which was incurred, in full or in part, to purchase its shares and
which would therefore constitute the provision of financial assistance within the meaning of Article
2358 and/or Article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code and/or any other law or regulation
having the same effect, as interpreted by Italian courts unless in compliance with the limitations and
exceptions set forth therein. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—Italy— Limitations on_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests under Italian Law—Whitewash_
_Procedure” and “Risk Factors—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral—Once granted, the Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their_
_validity and enforceability.”_

**_Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_**

Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by a guarantor incorporated
under the laws of Italy is issued to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be
limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and
expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the
Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees granted by a guarantor incorporated under
the laws of Italy must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed
amount must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant
Italian guarantor. It has been held, that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant
guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian
guarantor, there is the risk that the guarantee could be declared void.

**_Limitations to the Guarantees and Collateral_**

In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, _inter alia, corporate benefit and_
financial assistance, the maximum amount that the Company and Overlord Bidco may be required to
pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and
any other transaction documents related thereto, will be subject to limitations. By virtue of these
limitations, the Company’s and Overlord Bidco’s obligations under their Guarantees will be
significantly less than the amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or the Company and/or Overlord
Bidco may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.

As a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, among others, financial
assistance and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture,
the Existing Indenture, the Existing Term Loan Agreement, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement:

(i) the Guarantees and security interests granted by:

(A) the Company shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the principal amount of
the Overlord Funding Loan I outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the
Guarantee; and

(B) Overlord Bidco shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the principal amount
of the Overlord Funding Loan II outstanding at the time of the enforcement of its
Guarantee,


-----

in each case net of any proceeds already paid by the Company pursuant to the enforcement of
its guarantee under the Notes, the Existing Notes, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the
Existing Term Loan or by Overlord Bidco pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under
the Notes and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and/or received upon the enforcement of
any security interests granted by the Company or Overlord Bidco (as applicable); provided
further that each of the Company and Overlord Bidco shall not be liable as a Guarantor in
respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that the Company or Overlord Bidco is entitled
to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a
result of any payment made by the Company or Overlord Bidco under its Guarantee;

(ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by each of the Company and Overlord
Bidco, also in accordance with Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will
not exceed 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes;

(iii) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the
Company or Overlord Bidco will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in
respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes
guaranteed and/or secured by the Company or Overlord Bidco at that time;

(iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the
mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the
Italian Usury Law and Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests
(including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative
Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993), the obligations of each of the Company and Overlord
Bidco under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying
as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts
compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code
and/or Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993,
respectively.

In any case, the maximum amount that the Company and Overlord Bidco may be required to pay in
respect of their obligations as Guarantors under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant
security documents upon enforcement of the relevant Collateral will rateably concur and not cumulate
with the corresponding amounts due by the Company and Overlord Bidco to any guaranteed and/or
secured creditor pursuant to the Existing Notes, the Existing Term Loan Agreement, the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed
and/or secured creditors with respect to any further _pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the_
Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt,
by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantee and the security interests
granted by the Company and Overlord Bidco, the obligations of the Company and Overlord Bidco as
Guarantors and/or security providers under the Notes, the Indenture, the Existing Notes, the Existing
Indenture, the Existing Term Loan Agreement, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated
under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other
transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered
without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the
proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/ or security obligations of the
Company and Overlord Bidco shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the Company’s and
Overlord Bidco’s credit support as described above.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests shall be distributed
amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes)
in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes,
as applicable, will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Guarantees and security.


-----

**_Trust_**

The Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as
representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, Paragraph 3,
of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11,
2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of
the holders of the Notes or in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who
will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any
rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees.
However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of
such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, Paragraph 3, of
the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf the holders of the Notes, which are neither directly
parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and
corporate documents or public registries.

In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the
appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of
the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, Paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian
court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of
enforcement are not secured by the security under the Security Documents and/or that the
_rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of_
the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of Paragraph 3 of Article
2414-bis, Paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if
the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian
Court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is only
granted in favor of the rappresentante, the holders of Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured
by the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral.

Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative
(rappresentante comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian
Civil Code may be validly appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and
the validity and enforceability of such appointment may not be upheld by a court.

Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest
can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither
directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the
relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,”
since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature,
effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests
granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.

**_Certain Considerations in Relation to Security Interests_**

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to
protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In
this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the
company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any
entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in
the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated
to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower if the loan is
made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance
of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial
situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Pursuant to article 164
of the Italian Insolvency Code (as defined below), any payment made by the borrower with respect to
any such loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration are ineffective by operation of


-----

law. The new provision replaced article 2467, paragraph 1, of the Italian Civil Code, according to which
such payments would be required to be returned to the borrower. For a more detailed explanation of the
terms, conditions and consequences of claw back actions in an insolvency scenario, see “Certain Italian
_Insolvency Laws Considerations—Judicial Winding-Up (liquidazione giudiziale)” and “Hardening_
_Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer” below. In addition to that, Article 292, paragraph 1, of the_
Italian Insolvency Code sets forth that claims of entities exercising management and coordination
powers vis-à-vis the entities subject to such powers, and claims of the entities subject to such powers
vis-à-vis the entities exercising them, deriving from loans granted after the filing of petitions resulting
in the opening of judicial winding up of in the year before, are subordinated. The above rules apply to
shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be
interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its
shareholders, either directly or indirectly.

As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, there are several court precedents interpreting the
provisions relating to Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code summarized above. Some of such
precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated
as joint stock companies (società per azioni), hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany
loans that are a joint stock company (società per azioni).

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian
courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s (and, following the
Engineering Merger, MergerCo’s) relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant
intercompany loans, including to the Issuer’s relationship with the Company under the Overlord
Funding Loan I and the Company’s relationship with Overlord Bidco under the Overlord Funding Loan
II. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any
intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the
obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note (including any obligations of the
Company and/or Overlord Bidco under the relevant Overlord Funding Loans) be deemed subordinated
to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer
(and, following the Post- Completion Merger, MergerCo) may not be able to recover any amounts under
any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries (including any amounts under the
Overlord Funding Loans granted to the Company or Overlord Bidco), which could have a material
adverse effect on the Issuer’s (and, following the Engineering Merger, MergerCo’s) ability to meet its
payment obligations under the Notes.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany
loans (including any obligations of the Company and/or Overlord Bidco under the relevant Overlord
Funding Loans) or notes are subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to
recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or
security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries (including the Guarantees and/or the security
interests granted by Company and/or Overlord Bidco, respectively) may be impaired or restricted.


-----

## PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase
from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. The sale of the Notes will be made pursuant
to a purchase agreement among the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the date of the final
Offering Memorandum (the “Purchase Agreement”).

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to
purchase the Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the
obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among
other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Purchase Agreement also
provides that, if an Initial Purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Initial
Purchasers may be increased or, in some cases, the Offering may be terminated.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on
the cover of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change
the price at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The
Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates. The Initial Purchasers
reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in
part.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection
with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

The Sponsors or their respective affiliates may place a purchase order for and be allocated the Notes at
a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering
Memorandum, subject to a pass through of the Initial Purchasers’ discount (ignoring any credit) in
respect of the Notes purchased by such persons, unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers.

Investment funds advised by entities affiliated with the Sponsors may purchase Notes in the Offering
at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering
Memorandum. The Purchase Agreement between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers will not restrict
the ability of the funds and the affiliates of the Sponsors to buy or sell the Notes in the future and, as a
result, these investment funds and affiliates of the Sponsors may buy or sell Notes in open market
transactions at any time following the consummation of the Offering.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless
the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will
contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer
has agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the
Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or the Guarantors that are
substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through
and including the date falling 30 days after the closing of the Offering without the prior written consent
of the Initial Purchasers.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a
public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum
or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose
is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this
Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes


-----

may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any
applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does
not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer
or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes
are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the
distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge,
contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or
the safe harbors of Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

**General**

**_New Issue of Notes_**

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuer will apply for
the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Exchange. However, the Issuer cannot assure
you that such listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and
any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial
Purchasers without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will
develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular
time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
_Guarantees and the Security Interests—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in_
_which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

**_Price Stabilization and Short Positions_**

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and
penalty bids in accordance with applicable law. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering
size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit the
Initial Purchasers to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a
specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the
distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial
Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by
that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilization Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage
in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the
Stabilization Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging,
fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilization Manager may also over-allot the offering,
creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the
syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilization Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in
market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids.
These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels
that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilization Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and
may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or
trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Security Interests—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability_
_to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes
to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may


-----

begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and,
if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these
activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance
of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected
in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

**_United States_**

The Notes (including the Guarantees) have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act,
and may not be offered or sold within the United States. Accordingly, the Initial Purchasers have
represented and agreed that they have not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell, any of the Notes
(including the Guarantees) as part of their allocation at any time other than outside of the United States
in accordance with Regulation S.

Each of the Initial Purchasers has represented and warranted to us that:

(1) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and

Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”) with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in,
from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and

(2) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and it will only communicate or cause

to be communicated any invitation or instrument to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any
Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us.

**_United Kingdom_**

This Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom
and is only being distributed to and is only directed at persons who (i) have professional experience in
matters relating to investments and are investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Order”),
(ii) are high net worth companies, and other persons to whom it may lawfully be communicated, falling
within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to
whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity within the meaning of Section 21
of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) in connection with the issue or sale of
any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons
together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum must not be acted upon
by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering
Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant
persons. No part of the Offering Memorandum should be published, reproduced, distributed or
otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with
the issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does
not apply to us.

References to Regulations or Directives include, in relation to the UK, those Regulations or Directives
as they form part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or have
been implemented in UK domestic law, as appropriate.

**_European Economic Area_**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of Notes will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to produce a prospectus


-----

for offers of Notes. In relation to each Member State no offer of Notes to the public in that Member
State may be made other than:

(a) to any legal entity which is a Qualified Investor;

(b) to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons other than a Qualified Investor; or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 1(4) of the Prospectus Regulation,
provided that no such offer of Notes shall require us or any of the Initial Purchasers to
publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation. Accordingly,
any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should
only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or any of the Initial
Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers
have authorized, nor do authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any
financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which
constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum.

For the purposes of this section, the expression an “offer of Notes to the public” in relation to any Notes
in any Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information
on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or
subscribe the Notes.

**_Italy_**

No action has been or will be taken which could allow an offering to the public in the Republic of Italy
within the meaning of Article 1(1)(t) of the Italian Financial Act and, in particular, the Offering has not
been submitted to the clearance of CONSOB, pursuant to Italian securities legislation and will not be
subject to review or clearance by CONSOB. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered, sold or
delivered, directly or indirectly, in the Republic of Italy, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor
any other offering memorandum, prospectus, form of application, advertisement, other offering material
or other documentation relating to the Notes may be issued, distributed or published in the Republic of
Italy, either on the primary or on the secondary market, except: (a) to qualified investors (investitori
_qualificati) as referred to in Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation; or (b) in any other circumstances_
which are exempted from the rules on public offerings pursuant to Article 1 of the Prospectus
Regulation and any other applicable Italian laws and regulations.

The Notes may not be offered, sold or delivered and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other
material relating to the Notes, may be distributed or made available in the Republic of Italy unless such
offer, sale or delivery of Notes or distribution or availability of copies of this Offering Memorandum or
any other offering material or other documentation relating to the Notes in the Republic of Italy is made
in compliance with the selling restrictions above and must be made as follows: (a) by soggetti abilitati
(including investment firms, banks or financial intermediaries, as defined by Article 1, Paragraph 1(r)
of the Italian Financial Act), permitted to conduct such activities in the Republic of Italy in accordance,
as applicable, with the Italian Banking Act as subsequently integrated and amended, the Italian
Financial Act, the Issuer Regulation, CONSOB Regulation No. 20307 of February 15, 2018, as
amended and any other applicable laws and regulations; and (b) in compliance with all relevant Italian
securities, tax and exchange control and other applicable laws and regulations and any other applicable
requirements or limitations which may be imposed from time to time by CONSOB, the Bank of Italy
(including, the reporting requirements, where applicable, pursuant to Article 129 of the Italian Banking
Act and the implementing guidelines of the Bank of Italy, as amended from time to time) and/or other
competent Italian authority. Any investor purchasing the Notes is solely responsible for ensuring that
any offer or resale of the Notes by such investor occurs in compliance with applicable laws and
regulations.

**_Other Relationships_**

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in
the future investment banking, financial advisory and lending and commercial banking services to the
Issuer, its affiliates its shareholders, as well as the Group, in the ordinary course of business for which
they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. Certain Initial Purchasers and/or
their affiliates may hold equity interests and be entitled to appoint board members and/or other corporate
bodies’ members in the Issuer and/or its affiliates, its shareholders and/or their affiliates, including the
funds managed by the Issuer’s shareholders. In particular, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum,
Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. and/or its affiliates indirectly hold equity interests amounting to approximately
9.8% in NBRP Fund III (an indirect shareholder of the Issuer). The Initial Purchasers or their respective
affiliates expect to receive, customary fees and commissions for the Offering. The Initial Purchasers
and/or their affiliates also act as mandated lead arrangers and/or lenders under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility and the Existing Term Loan, as applicable, and as initial purchasers under the Existing
Notes (each of which is secured by, inter alia, a pledge over all of the shares of the Issuer held by TopCo
and a pledge over all of the shares of the Company held by the Issuer) and have received or will receive
customary fees for their services in such respective capacities.

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Bridge Facility (and have
received or will receive customary fees in respect thereof), which is expected to be prepaid and
cancelled as part of the Transactions, including with the proceeds of the Offering. Certain Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates may hold Existing Notes.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or
instruments of the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Group may also, in the future, act as hedge
counterparties to the Issuer or its subsidiaries consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions
in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future
trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates that have a lending relationship with
the Group may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research
views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to customers
that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. For the purpose of this
paragraph the term “affiliates” also includes the respective parent companies of the Initial Purchasers.

statement which has been declared effective under the Securities Act, (c) pursuant to

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

To the Sole Shareholder of
Centurion Bidco S.p.A.

Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Centurion Bidco S.p.A. and its subsidiaries
(“Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2022, the
consolidated income statement and the comprehensive income statement, the statement of changes in
consolidated shareholders’ equity and the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended,
and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting
policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the
consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2022, and of its consolidated financial
performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the
_Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of Centurion_
Bidco S.p.A. (“Company”) in accordance with the ethical requirements applicable under Italian law to the
audit of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Emphasis of Matter

We draw the attention to the note “Correction of material errors - IAS 8” to the consolidated financial
statements, where the Directors report that certain errors, committed at least since the 2019 financial
year, have been identified with respect to the accounting method used for costs and revenues relating to
certain purchase orders within the Finance Division of the subsidiaries Engineering Informatica S.p.A. and
Nexen S.p.A., which determined an overstatement of assets as at December 31, 2021 for Euro 46 million.

The Directors disclose they cannot precisely establish the relevant accrual periods of the Euro 46 million
assets overstatement with regard to each financial year prior to the current financial period, as the
information available in the management system does not allow the precise tracing back of the orders in
which the aforementioned errors were generated.

Therefore, given the inability to accurately and reasonably determine the period-specific effects of an
error on corresponding data for prior periods presented, the Directors, as required by IAS 8, restated the
opening balances of assets and equity as of January 1, 2022 for such amount.

Our opinion is not qualified in respect of this matter.

Other Matter

Our audit opinion is not issued according to the existing Law, as the parent Centurion Bidco S.p.A.
prepared the consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2022 on a voluntary basis, being
exempted from the obligation to prepare it under article 27 of Law 127/1991.

Responsibilities of the Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors for the Consolidated Financial
Statements

The Directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true
and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union, and, within the terms established by law, for such internal control as the Directors determine is
necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they have identified the existence of the
conditions for the liquidation of the Company or the termination of the business or have no realistic
alternatives to such choices.

The Board of Statutory Auditors is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by law, the
Group’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control.


-----

3

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report
to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease
to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain
solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by
ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**

**1** **General information**

Centurion Bidco S.p.A. (hereinafter referred to as "Company" or "Bidco") and its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as
"BidCo Group" or "Group") is the leading national player in the integrated offer of ICT service, products and consulting.
It was established in Padua on 6 June 1980.

With approximately 14,480 employees, and offices throughout Italy, the EU and Latin America, and with an agent in the
United States, the Group derives approximately 18% of its revenues abroad and manages IT initiatives in over 20
countries with projects for the Industry, Telecommunications, Banking, Energy & Utilities, Healthcare and Public
Administration segments. The Group operates in the outsourcing and Cloud Computing market through an integrated
network of 3 data centres located in Pont St. Martin (Aosta), Turin and Vicenza (Italy), which manage around 300 clients.

The Group operates in Software and IT Services industry with a leading position in numerous vertical sectors, thanks to
a wide range of proprietary solutions, from banking compliance (SISBA, ELISE, GRACE), to Billing and CRM for Utilities
(Net@SUITE), to integrated diagnostics and administration solutions for the Healthcare (AREAS) and mobile TLC
platforms.

The whole share capital of Centurion Bidco is held by Centurion Newco S.p.A. as Sole Shareholder.

This consolidated financial statement as of 31 December 2022 was approved by the Centurion Bidco S.p.A. Board of
Directors at its meeting held on 31 March 2023.

Following the implementation of the globally implemented vaccination plan, albeit in different ways in individual states,
it appears that the risk of a healthcare emergency has been significantly reduced.

Following the approval of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan ("PNRR") by the Italian Government, the Group's
target market will be subject to a positive impact on demand. Indeed, the PNRR provides for numerous financial
resources to be allocated to the implementation of the digitisation of the country's entire production system.
The other hypotheses referring to the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario (such as, for example, the inflation rate,
the GDP of the countries in which the Group operates, as well as the price trend), the dynamics of the financial markets
and exchange rates for the currencies to which the Group is exposed for purchases and sales, as well as the related
effects on the evolution of the economic and equity aggregates underlying the Economic-Financial Plan, do not take
into account any possible consequences of the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as these cannot be
quantified at this time.
Furthermore, it should be noted that the Group does not have any economic relations with clients in these areas.
With regard to access to the capital market and the dynamics of interbank interest rates to which the Group is subject
in order to repay its financial debts, it should be noted that the cost of the Group's debt is almost
entirely linked to fixed rates, with medium- to long-term maturities, so any fluctuations therefore will have a negligible
impact. Exceptions include hot money lines, the use of which is limited and linked to temporary cash needs, for which
the rate refers to the 3-month Euribor depending on financial market trends.

With regard to the development of the criminal proceedings pending before the Public Prosecutor's Office at the Court
of Milan (Italy) (G.R. No. 33849/18), it should be noted that, following the notification of the notice of conclusion of
preliminary investigations, a request for committal for trial was made for several natural and legal persons initially
involved in the investigation, as reported in press reports. The request for committal for trial, however, did not concern
Bidco, whose position was then dismissed.

The consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2022 have been prepared in accordance with
international accounting standards (IAS/IFRS) and take into account adjustments made to correct errors - as defined by
IAS 8 - that arose as a result of a process of verifying the manner in which costs and revenues of some of the orders
relating to BidCo's Finance Division and its subsidiary Nexen S.p.A. are accounted for. (also, part of the Group Finance
Division), also carried out with the help of external consultants. This process has been completed and relates to the
current and previous years, as detailed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, in the financial
statements, the figures are presented in accordance with the above-mentioned provisions in line with IAS 8.

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 40


-----

For the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the recognition and measurement of fair values of
assets acquired and liabilities undertaken were completed (within 12 months from the acquisition date) in relation to
the acquisition of the company on behalf of the Group. As envisaged by IFRS 3, the data that emerged was
retrospectively disclosed as of the date the acquisition took place, with the consequent change and supplement of
equity and Financial Statement figures already temporarily included in the consolidated Financial Statements for the
year ending on 31 December 2021.

Moreover, in order to provide a better presentation, the Group's financial assets and liabilities were re-classified from
trade receivables and payables to financial receivables and payables, and the comparison period was also adjusted to
reflect the new exposure.

1.1 Correction of material errors - IAS 8

IAS 8 (Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors) regulates, among other things, how to recognise
and represent errors, including those from previous years.

As a result of the incorrect method of accounting for the costs and revenues of certain contracts of the Engineering's
Finance Division and of the subsidiary Nexen S.p.A. (also part of the Group's Finance Division), it was necessary to make
changes to the financial statements in application of IAS 8.

The following is a summary of the facts and accounting methods adopted.

In September 2022, Engineering's management, as a result of some deviations found between budget and final data
referring to the end of August 2022, activated a process for checking the cost and revenue accounting methods of some
of the contracts related to the Engineering's Finance Division and to the subsidiary Nexen S.p.A., also carried out with
the help of external consultants. The audits concerning these contracts have been completed and led to the
identification of errors committed, at least since the 2019 financial year, which had two results: an overestimation of
balance sheet assets and the operating profit of the Engineering Group.

This was due to errors resulting from the allocation of costs in the management system, which led to the recognition already in the years prior to the current one - of revenues:

(i) not contractually defined, including by means of an association between the aforementioned costs and
revenues contractually envisaged in subsequent financial years, but originating from cost components other
than those that gave rise to the balance sheet assets as an offsetting item to the revenues;
(ii) in advance of their accrual.

As a result of the errors referred to in points i) and ii), non-recoverable balance sheet assets have arisen during the
financial years, including those prior to the current one, relating to Inventories of Customer contract assets (recognised
in the financial statements under current assets in the item "Customer contract assets"), because they cannot be
invoiced to customers.

The assessments were completed at the end of this financial year and allowed the Company to quantify the following
accounting effects at Group level as of December 31, 2022:

i. overestimation of the operating profit for the 2022 financial year by Euro 10.9 million;
ii. overestimation of the balance sheet assets as of January 1, 2022 of Euro 46.0 million.

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 41


-----

On the basis of the audits carried out, the Group is not materially able to establish with a precise determination the
accrual of the overestimate of Euro 46.0 million in relation to each of the years prior to the current one, in that the
information available in the management system does not allow to trace back in a precise manner the contracts in which
the aforementioned errors were generated in previous years as it is not possible to keep track of them once they have
been closed. On the other hand, the reconstruction is possible for the 2022 financial year in consideration of the
availability of current information on the progress of the Group Finance Division's contracts and their current
monitoring.

With regard to errors from previous years, the provisions of paragraphs 42 to 47 of IAS 8 apply. In the case at hand, as
it is not possible to accurately and reasonably determine the effects of the error with regard to each financial year prior
to the current one, owing to the process described above, which prevented the preservation of the historicity of the
relevant data, it is deemed appropriate to adjust the opening balance of assets and shareholders' equity of 2022, when
the error occurred, in order to reflect the lower value of the assets of Euro 46.0 million, by setting up a specific
adjustment provision with the opening shareholders' equity of 2022 as a balancing entry.

With regard to the accounting treatment of the correction of errors referring to the current financial year, these must
be corrected prior to the approval of the financial statements, as required by IAS 8 (par. 5), according to which "potential
errors of the current financial year discovered in the same financial year shall be corrected before the publication of the
financial statements is authorised". Therefore, in this specific case, the items in question have been corrected in the
income statement for the current 2022 financial year, generating a corresponding impact on the operating profit, which
was affected by the overestimation of Euro 10.9 million, and the corresponding amounts recognised in the statement
of financial position.

Following the audits conducted within the Engineering's Finance Division, these analyses were also extended to all the
other Market Divisions with the help of independent consultants; these analyses did not reveal any cases similar to
those identified in the Finance Department.

In any case, specific provisions were made prudentially, amounting to approximately Euro 7.0 million (of which Euro 6.1
million relating to contract work in progress and Euro 0.9 million to invoices to be issued), on some positions relating to
assets accrued in previous years and not yet invoiced, exclusively attributable to technical/commercial issues that
emerged during the execution of the orders.

**1.4** **Hyperinflation in Argentina**

Argentina has a long history of political and economic instability, with significant fluctuations in growth each year. In
2022, the country had an estimated 4% GDP growth. South America's second largest economy was again hit by the
highest inflation in 20 years, accumulating over 94% and the local currency devalued by 62% in 2022.

Consistent with the provisions of IAS 29 - Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, the restatement of the
financial statements as of December 31, 2022 as a whole, has resulted in the following:

- with regard to the income statement, costs and revenues have been revalued by applying the change in the general
consumer price index to reflect the loss of purchasing power of the local currency as of 31 December 2022. For the
purpose of converting the income statement thus restated into Euro, the exchange rate at 31 December 2022 was
consistently applied instead of the average exchange rate for the period. With reference to consolidated net sales for
the period, the effect of applying the standard resulted in a positive change of Euro 0,05 million for 2022;

- with regard to the statement of financial position, the monetary elements have not been restated since they were
already expressed in the current unit of measurement at the end of the period. Conversely, non-monetary assets and
liabilities have been revalued to reflect the loss of purchasing power of the local currency that occurred from the date
of initial recognition of assets and liabilities to the end of the period;

- the effect determined on the net monetary position for the portion generated in 2022 (total income of Euro 1.0 million)
was recognised in the income statement under net financial income.

**2** **Form, contents and accounting standards**

These consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 have been prepared under International Financial
Reporting Standard ("IFRS"), as defined hereinafter, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(hereinafter IASB) and adopted by the European Commission as per the procedure set down by Art. 6 of Regulation (EC)
No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and the European Council dated July, 19 2002. The IFRS Standards also
include all International Accounting Standards (IAS) and all interpretations of the International Financial Reporting
Standard Interpretations Committee, previously named "Standard Interpretations Committee" (SIC). The IFRS standards
have been applied consistently with the periods disclosed herein and, taking account of the best literature on this issue,
any future directions and interpretation updates will be reflected in the following financial statements, according to
modalities envisaged from time to time by the reference standards.

These consolidated financial statements are expressed in Euro and, in compliance with IAS 1 "Presentation of Financial
Statements" include the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Income Statement and the
Consolidated Comprehensive Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of changes in shareholders' equity, the
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related Explanatory Notes.

The consolidation was carried out under the line-by-line method, including the non-controlling interests reported in the
relevant shareholders' equity and income statement accounts.

-----

The Group companies adopted the same accounting period as the Parent Company and the standards utilised are the
same for the preparation as the last annual financial statements and were applied in a uniform manner.

In the Statement of Financial Position, assets and liabilities are classified according to the "current/non-current"
criterion with separation of assets and liabilities held-for-sale.

Current assets are those held for sale or used in the normal business operating cycle of the Company, or in the twelve
months following the year-end.

Current liabilities are expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle or within twelve months following the yearend. The income statement is classified according to the nature of the costs while the Cash Flow Statement uses the
direct method.

The transactions with related parties concern subsidiaries, associated companies and Directors and Executives with
strategic responsibilities.

The financial statements are accompanied by the Directors' Report prepared by the Board of Directors in compliance
with Art. 2428 of the Italian Civil Code, which contains more detailed information on Group operations and significant
events after the year-end.

For each item in the financial statements, the corresponding value for the previous year is shown for comparative
purposes.

**Critical judgments in applying the accounting polices**

There are no critical judgements made in applying the Group’s accounting policies.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

The preparation of the financial statements in compliance with IFRS also requires the use of estimates and assumptions
in determining the values of the assets and liabilities, costs and revenues and contingent assets and liabilities. The
estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the reporting date and on prior experience
where the book value of assets and liabilities is not easily inferable from other sources.

However, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions periodically revised and changes
are immediately reflected in the income statement.

The items that are mostly influenced by estimates are the calculation of amortisation/depreciation, impairment tests
on assets (including measurement of receivables), provisions for allocations, employee benefits, fair value of financial
liabilities, deferred tax assets and liabilities and customer contracts assets. For a better understanding of the financial
statements, the main estimates utilised in the drawing up of the financial statements are shown hereunder and involve
the use of subjective opinions, assumptions and estimates related to issues that are uncertain by nature. The changes
in conditions underlying the opinions and assumptions might have a significant impact on the following financial years.

_Impairment of Assets (Goodwill and Branding)_

As explained in more detail in paragraph "Goodwill" hereof, for the calculation of the value in use of Cash Generating
Units, the Group has taken into account, with reference to the specified period, the expected trends resulting from the
budget for 2023 and, for subsequent years, the forecasts included in the 2023 - 2027 multi-year plan. The impairment
test carried out on the basis of these forecasts did not generate any write-downs.

_Purchase Price Allocation (IFRS 3)_

As explained in the paragraph "Completing the accounting activities related to acquisitions", the recognition of business
_combination transactions implies the allocation of the payment of acquisition to the assets and liabilities of the acquired_

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 49


-----

company, which are evaluated at fair value. The possible difference, if positive, is recorded as goodwill; if negative, it is
recorded in the income statement.
In the process of assigning amounts to certain asset items, the Group applied estimates to determine their fair value.
To determine fair value, the Group used valuation methods, including discounted cash-flow analysis. To calculate the
present value of future cash-flows, it is necessary to formulate some assumptions regarding uncertain issues, including
Management's expectations regarding:

  - Marginality of customer portfolios;

  - The probability of renewal of contracts with customers;

  - The selection of the discount rate that reflects the risk.
The Group's estimates are based on assumptions deemed reasonable, but uncertain and foreseeable. These
assessments require the use of management assumptions, which may not reflect unpredictable events.

_Deferred Tax Assets_

The recoverability of deferred tax assets is subject to the achievement of sufficiently large future taxable profits for the
absorption of the aforementioned tax losses or to the competition of the deferred taxation connected to the other
deferred tax assets. Significant management assessments are required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets
that can be recognised in the financial statements based on the timing and amount of future taxable income. In
particular, it should be noted that deferred tax assets were recorded on past tax losses for the portion estimated as
recoverable against future taxable income shown in the updated strategic plans of the Group, also as a consequence of
the fact that tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

_Trade receivables_

The management carefully examines the outstanding trade receivables, also considering their seniority, collection
time and credit risk coverage. The specific and general impairment allowances recognised are based on the
management's best estimates at the reporting date.

Receivables factored through non-recourse factoring transactions, according to which the final transfer to the
transferee was carried out in relation to risks and benefits of factored receivables, were derecognised from the
financial statements upon their transfer. Receivables that were instead factored through with recourse factoring
transactions were not written off from the financial statements.

In 2022, the company did not encounter any problems with the collection of trade receivables. All market sectors do
not show any specific problems in relation to the continuation of the COVID emergency and most customers are large
companies with primary creditworthiness.

After evaluating the historical and forward-looking information, the Company decided, however, to use a new credit
management procedure, starting from 2022, which combines specific provisions with a generic method based on
objective elements. This method also makes it possible to correctly hedge the entire portfolio in proportion to the
risk.

_Receivable from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A._

As explained in further detail in paragraph entitled "Trade receivables" in these explanatory notes, trade receivables
include receivables as of December 31, 2022 from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. (former Sicilia E-Servizi S.p.A. or "SISE"), which
amounted to Euro 131.1 million (not including the related doubtful debt provision amounting to Euro 37.8 million and
the related doubtful debt provision for interest on arrears equal to Euro 52.4 million), of which Euro 14,5 million of
customer contract assets. These amounts were related to the IT activities connected with the building of an integrated
IT platform for the Sicilian Region, within specifications and provisions set out in the convention signed between the
Sicilian Region, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and Sicilia e-Servizi Venture S.c.a.r.l. in liquidation ("SISEV" or "Venture") on May
21, 2007 and expired on December 22, 2013.

_Fair value of options on non-controlling interest_

The fair value of liabilities, which represents a reasonable estimate of the exercise price for the options, was determined
using the discounted operating cash-flow method using the plan of the subsidiary involved.
The exercise prices are determined on the basis of the agreements contained in the option agreements signed by the
Group.

_Lease term_

The Group analysed all the lease agreements, defining the lease term for each of them, given by the "non-cancellable"
period together with the effects of any extension or early termination clauses, the exercise of which was deemed
reasonably certain. Specifically, for real estate, this evaluation considered the specific facts and circumstances of each
activity. As for the other categories of goods, mainly company cars and equipment, the Group has generally deemed it
unlikely to exercise any extension or early termination clause in consideration of the practice usually followed by the
Group. For the buildings, the Group, in assessing the lease terms, chose, based on business development plans, to
consider, in addition to the non-cancellable period, the first renewal period as reasonably certain, not believing that
there were facts or circumstances that led to consider additional renewals as reasonably certain.

**3** **Consolidation scope and principles**

**3.1** **Subsidiaries**

The subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group acquires control and deconsolidated from the date
in which control is lost. Control is defined as the ability to directly or indirectly determine the financial and management
policies and benefit from their implementation.

Consistently with provisions set out by IFRS 10, a company is controlled with the presence of the following three
elements: (a) power on the entity acquired/established; (b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns deriving from
involvement with the same; (c) capacity to utilise the power to influence the amount of these returns.

The accounts are consolidated under the line-by-line method, therefore including the entire amount of assets and
liabilities and all costs and revenues regardless of the percentage of share capital held. The book value of consolidated
investments is therefore eliminated against the related shareholders' equity.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the
date of acquisition until the date of sale. The operations, the balances as well as the unrealised profits and losses on
inter-group transactions are derecognised.

The shares of shareholders' equity and of the non-controlling interest result are included in a separate shareholders'
equity account and in a separate line of the consolidated income statement.

**3.2** **Associated companies**

Associated companies are defined as those in which significant influence is exercised. Such influence is presumed where
more than 20% of the effective or potentially exercisable voting rights are held at the reporting date.

The acquisition was recognised under the acquisition method described in the following paragraph 4.6. After acquisition,
equity investments in associated companies are recorded under the equity method or rather recording the result
attributable to shareholders of the parent and of the movements in the reserves respectively to the income statement

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 51


-----

and shareholders' equity. Non-realised profits and losses on inter-group transactions are derecognised for the relative
share.
When the losses attributable to shareholders of the parent in an associated company is equal to or greater than the
value of the investment held, the Group does not recognise additional losses unless an obligation to recapitalise exists
or if payments have been made on behalf of the associated company.

**3.3** **Joint arrangements**

Pursuant to provisions set forth by IFRS 11, investments in joint ventures are recorded under the equity method applied
as described in the previous Note. A joint venture is a joint operation where parties have rights on contractually agreed
assets and obligations for agreed liabilities. As regards joint operations, the standard envisages that the proportionate
assets, liabilities, costs and revenues, resulting from joint operations, are entered directly in the consolidated (and
separate) financial statements.

**3.4** **Consolidation scope**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Parent Company and those companies in
which the Parent Company holds control based on the provisions of IFRS 10. The financial statements of the Group's
companies are prepared as of the same date and refer to a financial year of equal length.

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 54


-----

**4** **Accounting principles**

These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as the Directors have verified
that there are no financial, management or other indicators that could report critical issues regarding the Group's ability
to meet its obligations in the foreseeable future. A description of how the Group manages financial risks, including
liquidity and capital risks, is provided in Note 4.27.

These financial statements were prepared using measurement criteria based on historical cost, with the exception of
the measurement at fair value of the derivative financial instrument hedging the variable interest rate risk relating to
an existing loan.

Where not specified, the significant changes reported in these explanatory notes principally relate to the changes in the
consolidation scope indicated above.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are described below.

**4.1** **Property, plant and equipment**

Property,plant and equipment include assets with long-term use held for the production or supply of goods and services,
to be used under lease or for administrative purposes. This definition does not include property held principally or
exclusively for rental purposes or for capital appreciation or for both of these reasons ("Investment property").

Property, plant and equipment are recognised at acquisition cost including any directly attributable costs. The
acquisition cost is the fair value of the price paid and any other cost directly related and necessary for the correct
functioning of the asset with regard to the use for which it was acquired. The capitalisation of costs relative to the
expansion, modernisation or improvement of the structural elements whether owned or leased is solely made within
the limits established to be separately classified as assets or part of an asset. Financial expenses incurred for the
acquisition of tangible fixed assets are never capitalised.

Land, both with and without civil and industrial buildings, is recorded separately and is not depreciated as it has an
indefinite useful life.

Property, plant and equipment are recorded net of the relative accumulated depreciation and any impairment. The
amount to be depreciated is comprised of the carrying amount gross of depreciation and net of write-downs. Given the
uniformity of the assets included in the various categories, the useful life by category is as follows (except in specific
cases):

**Category** **Useful life**

Land Indefinite

Buildings 33 years

Customer Relationship / Customer list 3 - 6 years

EDP 3 - 6 years

Furniture, office machinery and equipment 6 - 8 years

Motor vehicles 4 years

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful estimated life of the asset which
is reassessed and re-defined at least at the end of each financial year in order to take any changes into account.
The book value of a tangible fixed asset is recognised within the value limits that this asset may recover through use.
Wherever evidence indicates that difficulties may exist in the recovery of the net book value, an impairment test is
carried out.
Depreciation starts when the asset is available and ready for use.
At the time of sale, or when there are no expected future economic benefits from the use of an asset, it is derecognised
from the financial statements and any loss or gain (calculated as the difference between sale price and the book value)
is recorded to the income statement.

**4.2** **Leasing**

Accounting for the lessee:

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 55


-----

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract.

At the date of initial recognition, the lessee will recognise the asset (a right of use) covered by the contract at the same
value attributed to the related financial liability, adding other components of direct costs and any advance fees. The
lessee shall determine the duration of the lease, which shall begin on the date on which the asset is available for use,
to which shall be added any periods covered by an option to extend/resolve the lease, if the lessee is reasonably certain
to exercise/not to exercise that option.

The liability relating to the lease contract is recognised at the present value of the lease payments due, discounted using
the interest rate implicit in the lease contract or, if it is not available, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate,
i.e. the interest rate that it is prepared to pay to finance itself in order to obtain the right to use an asset with the same
characteristics as the lease contract.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

  - Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;

  - Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

  - The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

  - The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and

  - Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate
the lease.

The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The liability is subsequently restated to take account of any new valuations or changes in the lease or revision of
substantially fixed payments, it is reduced as a result of payments and is increased to reflect interest. Variable payments
that do not depend on indexes or rates and are therefore not reflected in the liability relating to the lease contract must
be recorded in the income statement when the installment is paid.

The Group restates the value of the Lease liabilities (and adjusts the value of the corresponding right of use) if there is:

  - a change in the duration of the lease or there is a change in the assessment of the exercise of the option right;
in this case, the lease liability is recalculated by discounting the new lease payments at the revised discount
rate.

  - a change in the value of the lease payments following changes in the indexes or rates, in such cases the Lease
liability is recalculated by discounting the new lease payments at the initial discount rate (unless the payments
due under the leases change as a result of interest rate fluctuations, in which case a revised discount rate must
be used).

  - a lease agreement has been modified and the modification is not included in the case studies for the separate
recognition of the lease agreement. In such cases, the lease liability is recalculated by discounting the new
lease payments at the revised interest rate.

The Group did not report any of the above changes during the period.

The right of use assets comprises the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at
or before the commencement day, less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

The right of use is depreciated on a systematic basis over the term of the lease contract. If the lease provides for the
transfer of ownership or a redemption option whose exercise is considered reasonably certain at the end of the contract,
the right of use is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of
the lease.

The right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position.

A provision for risks is made in compliance with the provisions of IAS 37 in the event that the Group is obliged to bear
the costs for dismantling and removing the leased asset, restoring the site where the asset is leased or restoring the
well under the conditions required by the terms of the contract. These costs are included in the value of the Right of
use.

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 56


-----

The right of use is subject to the impairment process provided for by IAS 36 in case of indicators of a loss in value.

This value will also change as a result of new valuations or changes in the liability relating to the lease contract.

In the statement of the consolidated cash-flow statement, the Group divides the total amount paid between the
principal portion (recognised in the cash-flow deriving from financial activity) and the interest portion (entered in the
cash-flow deriving from financial activity).

Cases of exclusion from the application of IFRS 16

The Group has decided not to recognise assets for the right of use and liabilities related to leasing:

  - short term (equal to or less than one year);

  - leasing of low value assets (identified below as Euro 5,000).

Therefore, the Group recognises the payments due relating to the aforementioned leases as a cost on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.

Lease accounting for the lessor

If the lease has the characteristics of a loan, the lessor recognises under financial receivables the amount of the lease
payments to be received and distributes the gross collections so as to obtain a constant rate of return based on the net
investment method.

If, on the other hand, the lease has the characteristics of an operating lease, the lessor will continue to keep the asset
under its fixed assets and will record the collections as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The costs
incurred to obtain the contract are considered as accessory charges to the leased asset.

**4.3** **Intangible assets**

Intangible assets, all with a finite useful life with the exception of the trademark,

are recognised when they are identifiable and it is probable that future economic benefits will be accrued by the Group.

Intangible assets are initially recognised at acquisition or production cost. The acquisition cost is the fair value of the
price paid to acquire the asset and any other direct costs incurred to prepare the asset for use. For intangible assets
generated internally, the generation of the asset is broken down into the periods of research (non-capitalised) and the
period of development (capitalised). Where the two periods are indistinguishable, the entire project is considered as
research and is recorded directly to the income statement.
Realised assets are amortised from the time of use or when they are sold. Until that date they are classified under assets
in progress.
Financial expenses incurred to acquire an intangible fixed asset are never capitalised.

After initial recognition, intangible assets are recognised on a cost basis, net of accumulated amortisation and any
impairment. Amortisation is applied on the straight-line basis over the period of expected use. Given the homogeneity
of the assets included within financial statement categories, with the exception of specific significant cases, the useful
lives per category are as follows:

**_Category_** **_Useful life_**

Development costs 1 - 5 years

Concessions, patents and licences 1 - 5 years

Engineering Trademark Indefinite

Concessions licenses and trademarks 1 - 8 years

0 1 - 5 years

The amortisation criteria as well as useful lives and residual values are reassessed and re-defined at least at the end of
each financial year in order to take any significant changes into account.
The book value of an intangible asset is maintained in the accounts as long as there is evidence that this value may be
recovered through usage. Wherever evidence indicates that difficulties may exist in the recovery of the net book value,
an impairment test is carried out.

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 57

|Category Useful life|Col2|

|Concessions licenses and trademarks 1 - 8 years||
|0|1 - 5 years|


-----

**Software**

Costs directly associated with information technology products, created internally or acquired from third parties are
capitalised as intangible assets when the following conditions are met:

   - the technical feasibility and intention to complete the product in order that the latter may be available for use
or sale;

   - the capacity to use or sell the product;

   - a definition of the manner by which the product will generate probable and future economic benefits (the
existence of a market for the product, or its internal use);

   - the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources for the purposes of completing the
development and the use/sale of the product;

   - the capacity to reliably estimate the cost attributable to intangible assets during development of the product.

Expenses for substantial updating of products are capitalised as improvements and added to the original cost of the
software. Development costs that improve product performance or upgrade the product to regulatory requirements
are reflected in projects created for customers and are thus expensed during the financial year in which they are
incurred.

**Concessions, patents and licences**

Costs associated with the purchase of concessions, patents and licences are capitalised under intangible fixed assets.
The cost comprises the fair value of the price paid to acquire the right and any other direct costs incurred for its
adaptation or for implementation within the operating or productive context of the entity. The period of amortisation
does not exceed the lower between the useful life and the duration of the legal/contractual rights.

**4.4** **Goodwill**

Goodwill is the excess of an acquisition cost in comparison to the company share of the fair value of the identifiable
assets and liabilities at the acquisition date.
Goodwill from the acquisition of companies for payment is not amortised and is subject to an impairment test at least
once a year. For this purpose, goodwill is allocated to one or more Cash Generating Units (CGU). Potential reductions in
value emerging from the impairment test are not reversed in subsequent periods.
In the case of the sale of assets (or part of an asset) of a CGU, any goodwill associated is included in the book value of
the asset in order to determine the profit or loss from sale in proportion to the value of the CGU sold.

Goodwill relating to associated companies or other companies is included in the book value of these companies.

At each period-end, goodwill is subject to an impairment test and is adjusted for any loss in value. Any impairment is
booked directly to the Income Statement.

For this purpose and in line with acquisitions of previous years, the different Cash Generating Units have been identified,
which respect the independence criteria in the organisational structure and the independent capacity to generate cashflow, and are then measured using impairment test.

A Current Value is determined for the relevant asset using a model for calculating the generation of future cash flows Discounted Cash Flow Model (DCF) - based on the end of year account situation for each CGU. The Current Value is
compared with the net book value and goodwill recorded in the financial statements to determine whether it is
necessary to write-down the investment and record a loss in the financial statements.

**4.5** **Loss in value of an asset (impairment)**

An impairment is established wherever the book value of an asset is greater than the recoverable value. Where
indicators of an impairment exist, an estimate of the recoverable value of the asset is made (impairment test) and any
write-down is applied. An impairment test is carried out at least annually for indefinite useful life assets, irrespective of
the existence of such indicators.

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 58


-----

The recoverable value of an asset is recorded at the greater of its fair value, net of sales costs, and its usage value. The
recoverable value is calculated for each individual asset, unless it is not capable of generating cash-flows from
continuous use sufficiently independent of cash-flows generated from other assets or groups of assets, in which case
the test is carried out at the level of the smallest independent Cash Generating Unit which comprises the relevant assets.

**4.6** **Business combinations**

In IFRS 3, business combinations are defined as "a transaction or other event in which a purchaser obtains control of
one or more businesses".
A business combination can be created through various procedures based on legal, fiscal or other motives. It may also
involve the acquisition by an entity of share capital of another entity, acquisition of the net assets of another entity,
undertaking of the liabilities of another entity or the acquisition of part of the net assets of another entity which,
combined, establish one or more company activities. The combination may be realised through issue of instruments
representing share capital, the transfer of cash or other liquid assets or other assets, or by a combination of the above.
The operation may take place between shareholders of an entity which combine or between an entity and shareholders
of another entity. It may entail the incorporation of a new entity that controls the entities taking part in the combination
or net assets transferred or the restructuring of one or more of the participating entities.

Business combinations are recorded under the acquisition method. This method considers that the acquisition price
must be reflected in the value of the assets of the entity acquired and this allocation must be at fair value (of the assets
and of the liabilities) and not of their book value. The difference (if positive) comprises the goodwill.

The changes in non-controlling interest of the parent company in a subsidiary, which does not lead to loss of control,
are recognised as equity transactions. In this event, the book values of the equity investments must be adjusted to
reflect the changes in their relative shareholdings in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the adjusted value of the
non-controlling interests and the fair value of the amount paid or received is directly recorded to shareholders' equity
and allocated to shareholders of the Parent Company.

**4.7** **Equity investments**

Acquisitions are recorded at the fair value of the investment plus any directly attributable costs.
A significant and prolonged decrease in equity investment fair value below the initial booked cost is considered an
objective indication of value loss.

Associated companies

Associated companies are defined as those in which significant influence is exercised. Such influence is presumed where
more than 20% of the effective or potentially exercisable voting rights are held at the reporting date.

**4.8** **Other non-current assets**

Financial receivables with a due date beyond 12 months and equity investments in other companies are recorded under
other non-current assets.

Investments in other companies refer to equity investments other than subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures
And they are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income.
A significant and prolonged decrease in equity investment fair value below the initial booked cost is considered an
objective indication of value loss.

**4.9** **Inventory**

Inventories are assets held for sale within the normal course of business or employed or to be employed in the
productive processes for sale or services.

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 59


-----

Inventories are measured at the lower between purchase cost and the fair value. The fair value is the sale price
estimated for normal activity, net of completion costs and sale expenses. The purchase cost is inclusive of all directly
attributable costs and indirect costs and is determined according to the weighted average cost method.

Any write-down is derecognised in subsequent years if the reason for the write-down no longer exists.

**4.10** **Customer contract assets**

Customer contract assets are represented by specific projects in the course of completion based on long-term contracts.

If the result of a project in course can be reliably estimated, the contractual revenues and costs are recorded based on
the percentage of completion method, so as to attribute the revenues and profits over the entire duration of the
contract.

If the result of a project in course of completion cannot be reliably estimated, the contractual revenues are recorded
for the amount of costs incurred if it is probable that such costs are recoverable.

The sum of costs incurred and the result on each project is compared with the invoices issued on account at the date of
the preparation of the accounts. If the costs incurred in addition to the profits recorded (deducting any losses) are
greater than the invoices issued on account, the difference is recorded under current assets in the item "Customer
contract assets". If the invoices on account are greater than the costs incurred plus the profits (deducting the losses),
the difference is classified under current liabilities in the account "Trade payables".

**4.11** **Deferred contract costs**

_4.11.a Incremental costs of obtaining a contract_

IFRS 15 allows for the capitalization of costs of obtaining a contract, provided that they are considered "incremental"
and recoverable through the future economic benefits of the contract. All costs incurred as a result of the acquisition of
the contract are considered as incremental costs. Costs, on the other hand, which have been incurred independently of
the acquisition of the contract, and therefore they cannot be classified as incremental, are expensed in the income
statement as they are not related to the stage of completion (not a cost-to-cost component).

Incremental costs are suspended and booked under a specific item of current assets (Deferred contract costs) and
systematically released together with the transfer of control of the goods/services to the customer.

_4.11.b Costs of fulfilling a contract_

IFRS 15 provides for the capitalization of costs for the fulfillment of the contract, i.e. those costs that meet all of the
following criteria:
   - relate directly to the contract;
   - generate and improve resources that will be used to meet the contractual performance obligation in the future;
   - are recoverable through future economic benefits of the contract.

Usually, this type of cost is represented by pre-operating costs, which are not explicitly recognised within contracts with
customers and are remunerated through the contract overall margin. In this case, in compliance with the three
conditions mentioned above, pre-operating costs are systematically suspended and released, corresponding to the
transfer of control of the goods and/or services to the customer.

In addition to the above, new provisions set out in IFRS 15 define all the costs that, for their type and nature, cannot be
used for the course of the contract as, despite the fact that they are specifically referable to the contract and considered
as recoverable, they do not generate or improve the resources that will be used to fulfill the contract performance
obligation, or contribute to transfer the control of goods and/or services to customers.

**4.12** **Trade receivables**

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 60


-----

Trade receivables are held as part of a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash-flows consisting
solely of payments of principal and interest on the amount of principal to be refunded. Consequently, they are initially
recognized at transaction price, adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs, and subsequently measured at
amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (i.e. the rate that equalize the current value of expected cashflows and the carrying amount at the time of initial recognition), suitably adjusted to take account of any write-downs,
by recording a doubtful debt provision. Trade receivables are included in current assets, with the exception of those
falling due more than twelve months after the reporting date, which are classified as non-current assets.

At each reporting date, financial assets, with the exception of those measured at fair value with a contra-entry
recognised in the income statement, are analysed to assess the existence of any possible impairment indicators.

IFRS 9 requires the application of a model based on expected credit losses. The Company applies the simplified approach
to estimate expected losses along the receivable useful life and takes into account its historical experience of credit
losses, adjusted to reflect current conditions and estimates of future economic conditions. The model of expected credit
losses requires the immediate recognition of expected losses over the useful life of the receivable, since it is not
necessary for a trigger event to occur for the recognition of losses.

For trade receivables recorded at amortised cost, when an impairment has been identified, its value is measured as the
difference between the asset book value and the present value of expected future cash-flows, discounted at the original
effective interest rate. This value is recognised in the Income Statement.

Receivables factored through non-recourse factoring transactions, according to which the final transfer to the transferee
was carried out in relation to risks and benefits of factored receivables, were derecognised from the financial statements
upon their transfer. Receivables that were instead factored through with recourse factoring transactions were not
written off from the financial statements.

As shown in the section “Key sources of estimation uncertainty”, in 2022 the Group updated the estimation model
relating to the calculation of the expected credit loss which supports the specific provisions. In particular, on the basis
of the historical series recorded, write-down percentages have been defined for overdue credit. These percentages are
applied to the aging brackets regardless of the type of customer and/or segment and are calculated automatically on a
monthly basis on the credit portfolio open on that date.

**4.13** **Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash, bank deposits on demand, other short-term financial assets with original expiry
not greater than 3 months and current account overdrafts. The latter, in the preparation of the Statement of Financial
Position, are included under "financial liabilities". Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at fair value.

**4.14** **Discontinued operations**

A discontinued operation is a company component that has been sold or is reclassified as held for sale and represents
an important independent operation or geographical area of operation or a subsidiary acquired solely for the purpose
of resale. An operating activity is classified as discontinued at the moment of the sale or when the conditions have been
satisfied for classification in the category "held for sale", if prior. When an operation is classified as sold, the separate
income statement and the comparative comprehensive income statement are re-determined as if the operation were
discontinued at the beginning of the comparative period.

**4.15** **Share capital**

Share capital consists of fully paid-up and subscribed capital. Treasury shares are recorded as a reduction of the share
capital for the nominal value of the shares while the excess of the book value compared to the nominal value is recorded
as a reduction of the other reserves. No profit (loss) is recorded to the income statement for the purchase, sale or
cancellation of equity instruments held.

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 61


-----

**4.16** **Reserves**

The reserves consist of specific capital reserves.

**4.17** **Retained earnings/(losses carried forward)**

The item "Retained earnings/(losses carried forward)" includes the net profit of the current and previous periods which
was neither distributed nor allocated to reserves (in the case of profits) or recapitalised (in the case of losses). This item
also includes the transfers from other equity reserves when those reserves are no longer required as well as the effects
of the recording of changes to accounting policies and material errors.

**4.18** **Financial liabilities**

Financial liabilities are initially booked at the fair value of collected sums, adjusted for any directly attributable
transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest criteria.

**4.19** **Treatment of the put options on subsidiary shares**

IAS 32 establishes that a contract that contains an obligation for an entity to acquire shares in cash or against other
financial assets, gives rise to a financial liability for the current value of the option exercise price.
Therefore, the liability must be recognised unless the entity has the unconditional right to avoid the delivery of cash or
other financial instruments upon the exercise of the put option on subsidiary shares.
The Group:
_(i) recorded, as a counter-entry of Equity reserves, the payables resulting from the obligation and any following changes_
in the same liability that are related to the mere elapsing of time (unwinding of price discount);
_(ii) expensed the latter to the Income Statement._

**4.20** **Employee benefits**

**Short-term employee benefits**

Short-term employee benefits are recorded to the income statement in the period in which the work is carried out. The
Company records a liability for the amount that it expects will have to be paid in the form of profit-sharing and incentive
plans when it has a current, legal or implicit obligation to make such payments as a consequence of past events and for
which the obligation can be reliably estimated.

**Post-employment benefits**

Post-employment benefits are recorded as costs when the Company has committed, in a demonstrable way and without
a realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan that provides for the termination of employment before
the normal retirement date or following an offer prepared to encourage voluntary redundancy. In the case of an offer
prepared by the Company to encourage voluntary redundancy, the benefits owed to employees for termination of
employment are recorded in the income statement as a cost if the offer is likely to be accepted, and if the number of
employees, expected to accept the offer, can be reliably estimated. Benefits owed after twelve months following the
closing date of the financial year are discounted.

**Defined benefit plans**

Post-employment benefits represent a plan of defined benefits which are certain in terms of their existence and sum
but uncertain in terms of the vesting of the post-employment benefits accrued as of 31 December 2006. The liability is
determined as the current value of the benefit obligation defined at the date of reporting, in compliance with Italian
regulations in force, and adjusted in order to take actuarial gains/losses into account. The amount of the defined
obligation is calculated and certified annually by an independent actuary based on the "Projected Unit Credit" method.
Actuarial profits and losses are recognised in the comprehensive income statement and recorded under shareholders'

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 62

equity on an accrual basis.

**Defined contribution plans**

As from January 1, 2007, the Group companies participated in defined contribution pension plans by means of the
payment of contributions to publicly or privately managed programmes; the latter may be mandatory, contractual or
voluntary. Payment of the contributions fulfills the Company's obligation to its employees. Contributions thus constitute
costs for the period in which they are due.

**4.21** **Provisions for risks, contingent liabilities and contingent assets**

According to IAS 37 provisions for risks concern the probable liabilities of uncertain amount and/or maturity relating to
past events whose fulfilment will necessitate the use of resources.
Provisions are recognised when: a) there is a current legal or implicit obligation, which originates from a past event; b)
it is probable that fulfilment of the obligation will be onerous; c) the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
The amount represents the best estimates in relation to resources required for fulfilling the obligation, including legal
defence charges. Where the effect of the current amount of the payment is significant, the amount of the provision is
represented by the value of resources considered necessary to satisfy the obligation on maturity discounted at a
nominal rate without risks. The contingent assets and liabilities (possible assets and liabilities or not recorded as the
amount may not be reliably estimated) are not recognised in the financial statements. However, information is provided
in this regard.

**4.22** **Revenues and costs**

_Revenues_

The Group recognises revenues deriving from contracts with customers and the related effects on accounts through the
following steps:
a) identification of the contract;
b) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
c) determination of the transaction price;
d) allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation;
e) recognition of revenues when the performance obligation is met.

Therefore, the amount that the Company recognises as revenue must reflect the consideration to which it is entitled in
transfer of goods and/or services to customers. These amounts shall be recognised when the underlying contractual
performance obligations have been fulfilled, or when the Group has transferred control of the goods or services to the
customer, in the following ways:
a) over time;
b) at a point in time.

The table below shows the main types of products and services that the Group provides to its customers and the related
methods of recognition:

Deliverable-based contracts

Deliverable-based contracts typically include fixed price projects (e.g.: system integration or design and development
of customised IT systems and related processes, the engineering of industrial processes and the distribution and storage
processes as well as the implementation of new digital platforms integrated into customers' processes and applications).
Contract terms typically range from 1 to 2 years.
Contract prices might be subject to incentives and penalties, based on achievement of specified performance targets or
level of benefits delivered to the customer.
For deliverable-based contracts, revenue is generally recognised over time, because at least one of the following
conditions is met:
(i) the Group's performance enhances or creates an asset that the customer controls as the group performs; or
(ii) the Group builds an asset that has no alternative use (e.g. it is customer-specific) and the Group has an enforceable
right to payment for performance to date in case of termination by the customer.
The Group applies the "cost-to-cost" method to measure progress to completion.
The percentage of completion is based on costs incurred to date relative to the total estimate of cost at completion of
the contract. Estimates of total contract costs are revised when new elements arise and changes in estimates and related
percentage of completion are recorded in the income statement.
The related costs on deliverable-based contracts are expensed as incurred.
The Company earns contractually the right to bill upon achievement of specified milestones or upon customer
acceptance of work performed.
The difference between the revenue recognised and the billing already carried out to certify the progress of the work is
recorded as "Contract assets".
Any up-front fees (non-refundable) received are recognised over the duration of the service.

"Resource-based" contracts

This type of contracts generally includes IT consultancy or operational activities on IT systems.
Revenue from Resource-based contracts is recognised based on working hours (or days spent) finalised for the
fulfillment of the service.
Each performance obligation is satisfied over time as the client continuously receives and consumes the benefits arising
from the service by the Group as it performs it.
The amount to be billed is representative of the value of the service delivered to the customer and therefore, applying
the right-to-bill practical expedient, revenue is recognised over time based on the working hours spent / working days
valued on the basis of defined prices.

"Service-based" contracts

The Group supplies goods (e.g. software) and services (e.g. installation, tax collection etc.) to customers.
These revenues are recognised at a point in time, when the control of the goods have passed to the customer and when

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 64


-----

all the benefits deriving from the performance have been transferred to the customer.
In particular, as far as Public administration and tax collection are concerned, the revenue is recognised when the
evidence of the collection has been provided (e.g. tax has been paid by the tax payer).
The direct costs charged to the tax collection activity which are considered recoverable through the fees that are
reasonably expected to be collected over the duration of the contract are recognised, up to the moment the obligation
is fulfilled, among the "Deferred contract costs".
Any up-front fees (non-refundable) received are recognised over the duration of the service.

"Assistance and maintenance-based" contracts

This type of contract generally includes assistance and maintenance services, innovative cloud services, and licensing
granted as a service, therefore on a right-to-access basis.
Each performance obligation is satisfied over time as the client continuously receives and consumes the benefits arising
from the service by the Group as it performs it.
The amount to be invoiced is representative of the service provided monthly / quarterly to the customer.
Any up-front fees (non-refundable) received are recognised over the duration of the service.

_Costs_

Interest is recorded at the effective rate based on the accruals principle.
Costs relating to the acquisition of new knowledge or discoveries, to the study of alternative products or processes, of
new techniques or models, to the design and construction of prototypes or incurred for other scientific research
activities or technological development are generally considered current costs and recorded to the income statement
in the year in which they are incurred. These costs are almost entirely attributable to personnel costs.

**Dividends**

Dividends are recognised at the date of endorsement of the resolution by the Shareholders' Meeting, unless the sale of
shares is reasonably certain before the coupon detachment date.

**4.23** **Grants**

Grants are recognised when there is reasonable certainty that they will be received and that the conditions required for
obtaining them are met.
When grants relate to cost components, they are recorded as revenues, and systematically allocated to different periods
to offset the costs to which they relate.
When the grants relate to an asset, for example plant, they are recorded in the income statement under revenues rather
than as an adjusted item of the book value of the asset for which it was obtained. Subsequently the useful life of the
asset for which it was granted is taken into account using the deferral technique.
Public grants drawn down as compensation of expenses and costs already incurred or with the intention to provide
immediate financial aid to the entity without which there would be future costs, are recorded as income in the year in
which they become payable.

**4.24** **Deferred and current taxes**

Current income taxes for the financial year are calculated based on an estimate of taxable income in compliance with
tax law provisions.

Deferred taxes are recognised with reference to the temporary differences between the book value of the assets and
liabilities recorded in the financial statements and the corresponding values recognised for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses and tax credits not used and carried over, as well as the assumed
temporary differences, insofar as there is a probable future taxable income for which the assets can be used. The value
of deferred tax assets is revised at the closing date of each financial year, and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 65


-----

**4.25** **Conversion of items into foreign currencies**

**Functional and presentation currency**

The financial statements items are valued utilising the currency of the primary economic environment in which the
entity operates ("functional currency").

The functional currency of the Parent Company is the Euro, which is the presentation currency of the consolidated
financial statements.

**Operations and balances**

Currency operations are translated into the presentation currency by using the exchange rate effective on the
transaction date. Exchange gains and losses from the settlement of these transactions and the translation of monetary
assets and liabilities into foreign currencies at the date of preparation of the accounts are recorded in the income
statement.

**Conversion of financial statements of foreign operations**

A foreign operation is an entity that is a subsidiary, associated company or joint venture of a reporting entity, the
activities of which are based or conducted in a country or currency other than those of the reporting entity. The
statement of financial position and income statement figures expressed in the functional currency of foreign operations
are converted into the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements at the exchange rate at year-end
for assets and liabilities and at the exchange rate in force at the date of the related transactions for revenues and costs
in the income statement or the comprehensive income statement. These latter are converted at the average exchange
rate in the period when such approximates the exchange rate at the date of the respective operations. Exchange
differences deriving from such conversions and from the conversion of the opening shareholders' equity at the closing
exchange rate are recognised in the comprehensive income statement. The total amount of the exchange differences
is presented as a separate shareholders' equity item until the divestment of the foreign operation.

**4.26** **Changes in accounting standards, errors and change of estimates**

**Changes in accounting standards**

Accounting standards are changed from one year to the next only when the change is required by a standard or if it
contributes to providing more reliable and significant information about the effects of transactions on financial standing,
as well as on the economic results, or cash-flows, of the entity. Changes in accounting policies are accounted for
retrospectively with the effect recorded in shareholders' equity for the first of the financial years presented. The
comparative information is restated accordingly. The prospective approach is made only when it is impractical to
reconstruct the comparative information. The application of a new or amended accounting standard is accounted for in
accordance with the requirements of the standard itself. If the standard does not provide for transition procedures, the
change is booked in accordance with the method described in the previous paragraph.

**Correction of errors from previous periods**

In the case of significant errors, the same method that is used for changes in accounting standards illustrated in the
previous paragraph is applied. In the case of non-significant errors, these are accounted for in the income statement in
the period in which they are noted.

**Changes in accounting estimates**

Changes in accounting estimates are recognised and are booked to the income statement in the period in which the
change occurs, so long as the change only affects this period; where the change also affects future periods, the changes
are booked in both the period in which the change occurs and in the future period.

**4.27** **Financial risk and capital management**

As in all businesses, risk factors, which may affect the Group results, exist and therefore preventive actions have been
taken. These procedures concern the commitment and responsibilities undertaken and are subject to maximum
transparency and correctness. The Company's risk management policies aim at identifying and analysing risks to which
the Company is exposed, establishing appropriate limits and controls and monitoring risks with respect to those limits.
These policies and the related systems are regularly revised to reflect any variations in market conditions and Group
activities.
The Company's activities are exposed to the following risks: market risk (defined as exchange and interest rate risks),
credit risk and liquidity risk.
As regards the policies for the management of equity, the Board of Directors provides for a high level of capital
management policies in order to maintain trust among investors, creditors and the market, allowing for future
development. The Board also monitors capital returns, understood as the result from operations compared with total
shareholders' equity. Furthermore, the Board of Directors monitors the level of dividends to be distributed to holders
of ordinary shares.

**4.27.1** **Credit risk**

Credit risk represents the Company's exposure to the risk of potential losses resulting from the non-performance of
obligations undertaken by the counterparties.
The allocations for doubtful debts provisions carried out by Group companies reflect the expected credit losses.
The Group manages credit risk mainly by having relationships with counterparties with a high creditworthiness and
does not present significant concentrations of credit risk.
Maintaining effective credit risk management is a strategic objective for the Company and in this sense, the type of
business and the payment instruments activated guarantee a limited credit risk overall.
The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on investments in debt instruments that are measured
at amortised cost or at FVTOCI, lease receivables, trade receivables and contract assets, as well as on financial guarantee
contracts. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since
initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.
The Group always recognises lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) for trade receivables, contract assets and lease
receivables. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the
Group's historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic
conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date,
including time value of money where appropriate.

Maximum credit risk exposure is examined in more detail in paragraph entitled "Trade receivables" hereof.

**4.27.2** **Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is understood as the difficulty of fulfilling obligations associated with financial liabilities settled in cash or
through another financial asset.
The difficult economic and financial context of the markets requires particular attention to be paid to the management
of liquidity risk and in this sense to actions aimed at generating financial resources through operational management
and maintaining an adequate level of available liquidity. The Group therefore plans to meet the requirements deriving
from financial payables falling due and expected investments through cash-flows from operations, available liquidity
and centralised management of the Group's treasury.
The Group believes that it has access to sufficient sources of financing to meet its planned financial needs, taking into
account its cash and cash equivalents, its ability to generate cash-flows, its ability to find sources of financing in the
bond market and the availability of credit lines from banks.

A detailed analysis of the due dates for financial liabilities is contained in paragraphs 20 and 25 hereof.

**4.27.3** **Market risk**

The strategy followed for this type of risk is aimed at mitigating interest rate and exchange rate risks and optimising the
cost of debt.
These risks are managed in accordance with the principles of prudence and in line with best market practices.

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 67


-----

The main objectives set out in the policy are as follows:

  - to pursue the defence of the long-term plan scenario from the effects caused by exposure to exchange rate
and interest rate risks, by identifying the optimal combination of fixed and variable rates;

  - to pursue a potential reduction of the Group's debt cost;

  - to manage transactions in derivative financial instruments, taking into account the economic and equity
impacts that these transactions may have, including in relation to their classification and accounting.

The exposure to interest rate risk arises from the need to finance operations and M&A investments and using available
liquidity. Fluctuations in market interest rates can have a negative or positive impact on the Group's economic result,
indirectly influencing the costs and returns of financing and investment transactions. The interest rate risk to which the
Group is exposed derives from bank loans. The Group constantly monitors the trend in interest rates to mitigate this
risk and, when deemed appropriate, possibly makes use of derivative instruments designated as "cash-flow hedges".
The use of such instruments is governed by written procedures consistent with the Group's risk management strategies,
which do not include derivative instruments for trading purposes.

**4.28** **Related parties**

The Bidco Group has adopted the Procedure for the Identification and Conduct of Related Party Transactions. During
the financial year, the Company carried out transactions with a number of related parties.

All balances with related parties were determined under normal market conditions. The general conditions governing
transactions with executives with strategic responsibilities and their related parties do not appear to be any more
favorable than those applied, or which may have been reasonably applied, in the event of similar transactions under
normal market conditions with executives without strategic responsibility of the same entities.

**4.29** **New IFRS and IFRIC interpretations**

For the purposes of drafting the Group's consolidated financial statements, the international accounting standards
(IFRS) approved by the European Commission and effective on December 31, 2022 were applied.

**ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND IFRS INTERPRETATIONS APPLIED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2022**

The following accounting principles, amendments and IFRS interpretations were applied for the first time by the Group
as of 1 January 2022:

**ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND IFRS INTERPRETATIONS APPLIED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2022**

The following accounting principles, amendments and IFRS interpretations were applied for the first time by the Group
as of January 1, 2022:

   - On May 14, 2020, the IASB published the following amendments:
`o` **_Amendments made to IFRS 3 - Business Combinations: the amendments aim to update the reference_**
made in IFRS 3 to the Conceptual Framework in the revised version, without entailing amendments to
provisions of the principle.
`o` **_Amendments made to IAS 16 - Property, plant and equipment: the amendments aim to prevent_**
deduction from costs relating to Property, plant and equipment of the amount received from the sale
of assets manufactured during the testing phase of the asset itself. These revenues from sales and
related costs will therefore be recognised in the Income Statement.
`o` **_Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: the amendment_**
clarifies that in assessing a possible onerous contract, all costs that relate directly to the contract
should be comprised. As a result, the assessment as to whether a contract is deemed onerous includes
not only the incremental costs (such as, for example, the cost of direct material used in the work itself),
but also all costs that the company cannot avoid since it has entered into the contract (such as, for
example, the depreciation rate of the machinery used to perform the contract).
**_Annual Improvements - 2018-2020: amendments were made to IFRS 1 - First-time Adoption of International_**
_Financial Reporting Standards, to IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments, to IAS 41 Agriculture and to the Illustrative_
_Examples of IFRS 16 - Leases._

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 68


-----

The adoption of these amendments had no impact whatsoever on the Group consolidated financial
statements.

**IFRS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS APPROVED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION, NOT**
**YET APPLIED MANDATORILY AND NOT ADOPTED IN ADVANCE BY THE GROUP AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022**

  - On May 18, 2017, the IASB published **IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts, which is intended to replace IFRS 4 -**
_Insurance Contracts._
The aim of the new standard is to ensure that an entity provides relevant information that accurately
represents the rights and obligations arising from insurance contracts issued. The IASB developed the standard
to eliminate inconsistencies and weaknesses in existing accounting policies by providing a single principlebased framework to account for all types of insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts that an insurer
holds.
The new standard also envisages presentation and information requirements to improve comparability
between entities belonging to the same sector.
According to the new standard, an insurance contract is measured based on a General Model or a simplified
version named Premium Allocation Approach ("PAA").
The main characteristics of the General Model are as follows:
`o` the estimates and assumptions of future cash flows are always based on current ones;
`o` measurement reflects the time value of money;
`o` estimates envisage an extensive use of observable market information;
`o` there is a current and explicit measurement of risk;
`o` the expected revenue is deferred and aggregated in clusters of insurance contracts upon initial
recognition; and
`o` the expected profit is measured over the contractual coverage period, taking into account
adjustments resulting from changes in the cash flow assumptions for each group of contracts.

The PAA approach measures the liability for the remaining coverage of a cluster of insurance contracts,
provided that, upon initial recognition, the entity provides that this liability reasonably represents a reasonable
approximation to the General Model. Contracts with a coverage period of one year or less are automatically
eligible for the PAA approach. Simplifications resulting from the application of the PAA method are not
applicable to the measurement of liabilities for claims in place, that are measured based on the General Model.
However, discounting of cash-flows is not required if the balance is likely to be paid or received within one year
from the claim date.
The entity shall apply the new principle to insurance contracts issued, including reinsurance contracts issued,
reinsurance contracts held and investment contracts with a Discretionary Participation Feature (DPF).
The standard is applicable as from 1 January 2023 but early application is allowed solely for entities which apply
IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The directors do not expect
a significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements following the adoption of this standard.
On December 9, 2021, the IASB published the amendment **_"Amendments made to IFRS 17 - Insurance_**
**_contracts: Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 – Comparative Information". The amendment is a transition_**
option relating to comparative information about financial assets submitted at the date of the initial application
of IFRS 17. The amendment aims to avoid temporary accounting mismatches between financial assets and
insurance contract liabilities, and therefore to improve the usefulness of comparative information for those
who need to interpret financial statements. The amendments come into force as from 1 January 2023, together
with the application of the IFRS 17 principle. The directors do not expect a significant effect on the consolidated
financial statements of the Group following the adoption of this amendment.

  - On February 12, 2021, the IASB published two amendments: "Disclosure of Accounting Policies—Amendments
**_made to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2" and "Definition of Accounting Estimates—Amendments made_**
**_to IAS 8". The amendments aim to improve disclosure about accounting policies in order to provide investors_**
and other primary users of financial statements with more useful information and to help companies
distinguish changes in accounting estimates from those made to accounting policies. The amendments come
into force as from January 1, 2023 but earlier application is permitted. Directors are currently assessing the
possible impact of the introduction of these amendments on the consolidated financial statements of Group.
On May 7, 2021, the IASB published the amendment "Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax
**_related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction". The document clarifies how deferred taxes_**
should be accounted for on certain transactions that may generate assets and liabilities of equal amounts, such

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 69

as leases and dismantling obligations. The amendments come into force as from January 1, 2023 but earlier
application is permitted. The directors do not expect a significant effect on the consolidated financial
statements of the Group following the adoption of this amendment.

**ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND IFRS INTERPRETATIONS NOT YET APPROVED BY THE EUROPEAN**
**UNION**

As of the date of authorisation of this document, the competent bodies of the European Union have not yet completed
the process of approval that is necessary for the adoption of the amendments and principles described below.

  - On January 23, 2020, the IASB published the amendment "Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial
Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current" and on October 31, 2022 published an
amendment entitled "Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Non-Current Liabilities with
Covenants". The documents aim at clarifying how payables and other short or long-term liabilities should be
classified. The amendments are applicable as from 1 January 2024 but earlier application is permitted. The
directors do not expect a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group following the
adoption of this amendment.

  - On December 9, 2021, the IASB published the amendment "Amendments made to IFRS 17 - Insurance
contracts: Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 – Comparative Information". The amendment is a transition
option relating to comparative information about financial assets submitted at the date of the initial application
of IFRS 17. The amendment aims to avoid temporary accounting mismatches between financial assets and
insurance contract liabilities, and therefore to improve the usefulness of comparative information for those
who need to interpret financial statements. The amendments come into force as from 1 January 2023, together
with the application of the IFRS 17 principle. The directors do not expect a significant effect on the consolidated
financial statements of the Group following the adoption of this amendment.

  - On September 22, 2022, the IASB published the amendment "Amendments to IFRS 16 Income Taxes: Lease
**_Liability in a Sale and Leaseback". The document requires the seller-lessee to measure the lease liability arising_**
from a sale and leaseback transaction so as not to recognise an income or loss that relates to the retained right
of use. The amendments come into force as from 1 January 2024 but earlier application is permitted. The
directors do not expect a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group following the
adoption of this amendment

  - On January 30, 2014, the IASB published the standard IFRS 14 – Regulatory Deferral Accounts, which allows
only those parties which adopt the IFRS for the first time to continue to book the amounts relative to activities
subject to regulated rates ("Rate Regulation Activities") according to the previously adopted accounting
standards. Given that the Company/Group is not a first-time adopter, this standard cannot be applied.

**4.30** **Seasonality of the Group' s operational activity**

Group activities are not subject to seasonality directly related to the type of business.

**5** **Segment-related information**

The Management considers the Group as six operating segments under IFRS 8.

Information reported to Group’s Chief Executive (the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM)) for the purposes of
resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is focused on the skills and reference market and reflect
the business model which is currently split in 6 industries:

    - Finance: refers to the IT services provided to banks, insurance companies and financial institutions;

    - Public Administration and Municipalities: refers to the IT services provided to central and local public
administration;

    - Healthcare: refers to the IT services provided to healthcare;

    - Industry & Services: refers to the IT services provided to large and medium-sized corporations;

    - Telco & Media: refers to the IT services provided to telecommunication companies and other media
corporations;

    - Energy & Utilities: refers to the IT services provided to players in the energy and utilities markets.

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 70


-----

The accounting policies of operating segments are the same as the Group's accounting policies described in note 4.

Adjusted EBITDA represents, for the Group, the Alternative Performance Measure for the purpose of resource allocation
and assessment of segment performance, as well as of targets.

Revenues and direct costs are allocated in relation to the related industry. The other income and operating expenses,
not specifically attributable to segment, have been attributed in relation to their net revenues, that represents the most
appropriate driver to allocate them.

The following is an analysis of the Group's revenue by operating segment:

(in Euro million)

**31.12.2022** **31.12.2021**

 The Trademark, with a value equal to Euro 515.6 million, refers to the Engineering brand, a value recorded

Informatica group and its subsidiaries by Bidco on 23 July 2020.

Acc. impairment losses - - - **0**

**Net value – Trademark** **515,663,004** **0** **0** **515,663,004**

The Trademark is a right, which is legally protected through the registration at the competent authorities. By reason of
the fact that this right has no legal, contract, competitive or economic term which limits its useful life, the same is
classified as an indefinite life intangible asset and therefore it is not amortised but it is subject to loss in value when
tested for impairment, as provided for by IAS 36. The impairment test carried out as of 31 December 2022 had confirmed
that there was no need to write down the value of the trademark with an indefinite useful life expressed in the
consolidated financial statements.
The essential parameters relating to the impairment test of the Engineering brand correspond to those illustrated in
Note 9 "Goodwill" with reference to the Group's aggregate development plan and WACC.

The increase in "Customer Relationship/Customer list" was mainly due to the identification and measurement of the
fair values, in accordance with IFRS 3, of the assets and liabilities of the following companies and the allocation process,
at the date of taking control, of the consideration paid for the takeover of the companies: Plusure S.p.A., Gruppo
Movilitas, C Consulting S.p.A.. With regard to the companies C Consulting S.p.A. and Movilitas Group, there was also a
retrospective adjustment made to the 2021 values.

The Group has several assets including buildings, cars and IT equipment identified as leases.
The average life of the relevant rights of use is 2, 6 and 3 years respectively.

The lease contracts do not have any further significant extension option respect to lease term considered to
determine the lease liability. Lease contracts do not have any significant variable lease payments, any restrictions nor
covenants and no sale and leaseback transactions were occurred during the period.

Increases relating to the item " Buildings IFRS 16" amounting approximately to Euro 40.3 million refer to new leases or
renewals entered into during the year 2022.While the related decrease of Euro 13.1 million is mainly attributable to the
early termination of a corporate office lease agreement.

The "Other assets IFRS 16 " refer entirely to cars under operating lease, assigned to employees and its amortisation has
been reclassified under personnel costs.

The value of goodwill as of 31 December 2022 recorded in the BidCo Group's Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position amounts to Euro 1,270.6 million.

As provided for by IFRS 3, following the completion of accounting assets connected to measurement at fair value of
assets acquired and liabilities undertaken and the consequent retrospective adjustment of amounts, the goodwill value
as of 31 December 2021 (Euro 769.7 million) was re-stated for an amount equal to Euro 741.5 million.
More specifically, the retrospective adjustment is attributable to the identification and measurement of the fair values,
in accordance with IFRS 3, of the company's assets and liabilities;

    - C Consulting S.p.A., which resulted in goodwill at December 31, 2022 amounting to Euro 10.2 million
compared to goodwill at December 31, 2021 amounting to Euro 14.4 million.

    - The Movilitas Group, which resulted in goodwill at December 31, 2022 amounting to Euro 17.0 million
compared to goodwill at December 31, 2021 amounting to Euro 41.0 million.

The increase compared to the financial statement as of December 31, 2021 is due to:

  - Provisional allocation of the goodwill related to the BE Shaping the Future Group amounting to Euro 478.1
million

  - Provisional allocation of the goodwill related to the Atlantic group amounting to Euro 46.8 million

  - Final allocation of the goodwill related to PluSure S.p.A. amounting to Euro 3.7 million

  - The exchange rate difference that occurred during 2022, which amounted to Euro 0.5 million. These differences
refer to the goodwill of Dynpro Systemas S.A., to the goodwill of the Movilitas group and the It Soft USA Inc.
"DAA" business unit, as the value in local currency remained unchanged.

The analysis was performed to determine the goodwill recoverable value, which was allocated to Cash Generating Units
(CGUs) to which it is related.

CGU is defined as an asset or small group of assets that generate incoming cash-flows that are widely independent from
the incoming cash-flows resulting from other assets or group of assets. The CGUs were determined based on the market
segments and the single operating investees, consistently with the corporate Management view in terms of monitoring
of results and economic planning.

The impairment test carried out as of December 31, 2022 on the goodwill allocated to the Cash Generating Units (CGUs)
to which it relates confirmed that there is no need to write-down the value disclosed in the financial statements.
Based on the impairment test carried out according to the requirements of IAS 36 described above and according to
special modalities described hereunder, the aggregate value of the goodwill tested for impairment was deemed as
adequately supported in terms of expected economic results and related cash-flows.

There is no evidence at the present date for the Company to proceed with any impairment.

For the identification of the recoverable value – the "value in use" of the CGUs – obtained through discounting, of the
cash-flows (DCF Model) extrapolated from the five-year business plans, the following elements were considered:

a) estimates of future cash-flows generated by the entity;
b) expected possible changes in these cash-flows in terms of the amount and time periods;

c) cost of money, comprising the current market risk-free rate of interest;
d) cost to assume the risk related to implicit uncertainty in the management of the CGU;
e) other risk factors concerning the operations of a specific market and changes over time.

Hereunder are the main basic assumptions, used for impairment testing for every CGU.

The parameters utilised for discounting the cash-flows and the Terminal Value under the DCF model illustrated above
were as follows:

 Risk free rate equal to the annual average of the yield on 10-year government bonds in which the Group
predominantly operates (source: Marketwatch) and amounted to 3.12%.
 Equity Risk Premium equal to the higher expected return from the capital market (equity) compared to an
investment in risk-free debt securities. The rate used for the assessments is the average figure for the last five
years (source: Damodaran) and amounted to 5.21%.
 Debt cost, equal to the average indebtedness cost (long and short term) of the Group equal to approx. 6%;
 Beta Unlevered and debt ratio (D/E) equal to the average of the last five years respectively (source:
Damodaran) of companies belonging to the sector comparable to the one of reference ("Software - System &
Application"). The Beta Levered, equal to 1.06, was therefore determined on the basis of the aforementioned
parameters and the theoretical reference tax rate.
 LTG (Long Term Growth) equals the long-term inflation-weighted growth rate for the countries in which the
Group operates equals 2%.

For an 8.25% WACC relating to the tests prepared on the Engineering Group's consolidated financial statements.

When compared to the financial model of last year's Impairment Test, a higher WACC 2022 than WACC 2021 emerges
for all CGUs. The reasons for this increase can be traced back to the following factors:
1. Higher risk-free rate in 2022 (3.12% vs. 1.93% in 2021);
2. Higher Equity Risk Premium in 2022 (5.21% vs. 5.08% in 2021);

**Breakdown WACC**

The following table also shows the breakdown WACC by CGU / Company. Rounding down the WACC values in the table
by about 0.01%, the value in use is equal to the book value.

Deferred tax assets were recognised among assets both in the current period and in the previous period in so far, as
their realisation as tax income is considered probable in the year in which these deferred tax assets will be reversed in
the income statement. These concern the temporary differences between the book values and the tax recognised values
of some financial statement items.

The item "Business combination" is referred to the first consolidation of the BE Shaping The Future Group.

Customer contract assets represent ongoing projects relating to multi-year contracts and include, inter alia, adjustments
for projects for which critical issues have emerged in terms of feasibility of the value, the relevant amount representing
the best estimate based on the information in our possession.

During the financial year, in spite of the crisis period due to the pandemic, there were no significant changes in the
contractual conditions, thanks also to the activities carried out in smart working mode. The Group was not subject to
penalties for non-fulfillment of contractual obligations or withdrawal by customers.

During this period, the item "Customer Contract Assets" included re-classifications attributable to the application of IAS
8, as well as a change amounting to Euro 46.0 million attributable to an adjustment of the estimates of work in progress
related to previous years of Engineering's Finance Division and the subsidiary Nexen S.p.A., as well as a prudential
provision of approximately Euro 6.1 million for the other Divisions, as specified in the General Information section to
which we refer.

There were no significant changes in the contractual terms and conditions and the company was not subject to penalties
for breach of contractual obligations or termination by customers.

The Group applies the simplified approach of IFRS 9 to measure the expected credit loss on trade receivables and
customer contract assets. Customer contact assets refer to invoices to be issued for contracts in progress, and have
substantially the same risk characteristics as trade receivables for the same type of contracts. The Group has therefore
concluded that the expected credit loss for trade receivables represents a reasonable approximation of the losses on
customer contract assets. The allocation for the period related to ECL is included under item "Adjustments and changes
in customer contracts".

For further information on the ways to calculate expected credit loss, reference is made to the following paragraph
"Trade receivables".

**16** **Deferred contract costs**

_(in Euro)_

**Description** **31.12.2022** **31.12.2021** **Change**

Deferred contract costs 17,023,698 17,447,808 (424,110)

During 2022, the Group recorded deferred contract cost in relation to obtaining the contract represented by the socalled transition and start-up costs for Euro 5.5 million. These are costs directly associated with the performance of the
services offered and, in particular, refer to the costs incurred for the taking over of orders (transition cost) or costs for
specific training of personnel preparatory to the execution of a particular order (start-up cost). These costs are realised
in the normal operating cycle.

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 82


-----

The Group has also recorded contract costs in relation to the fulfillment of the contract amounting to Euro 8.9 million.
These are direct costs charged to orders, which include the purchase of materials from third parties, outside labour and
the cost of employees.

The portions of cost released pertaining to the year 2022, determined on the basis of the ratio between revenues
accrued for the activities carried out at the reporting date and the total revenues estimated up to the end of the
concession, amount to Euro 4.9 million for the so-called transition costs and start-up costs, and Euro 9.9 million for the
contract fulfillment costs.

**17** **Trade receivables**

The book value of trade receivables and other receivables is shown at amortised cost and the value approximates the
fair value. The value refers to receivables from banking institutes, utilities, industry, services, public administration and
companies operating in the telecommunications market.

Trade receivables are all due within twelve months.

**Total** **543,763,318** **623,113,637** **(79,350,320)**

The Group applies the simplified approach of IFRS 9 to measure the expected credit loss on all trade receivables and
customer contract assets.

As mentioned in the section "Use of Estimates and Valuations," the company decided, as of the financial year 2022, to
use a new credit management procedure that combines specific provisions with a generic method based on objective
elements. This method also enables the entire portfolio to be correctly hedged in proportion to the risk. More
specifically, generic % write-downs on past due loans were defined on the basis of the time series recorded. These
percentages are applied to aging bands regardless of the type of customer and/or segment and are automatically
calculated monthly on the credit portfolio open at that date.

Based on the model described above, it is specified that the provision for bad debts includes an expected credit loss
amounting to a total of Euro 23.7 million.

The following table provides information on credit risk for total Customer Contract Assets, Trade Receivables from Third
Parties and Deferred Contract Costs and Inventory.

On this basis, the allowance for bad debt to be subject to collective impairment as of 31 December 2022, was
determined as follows.

The following table shows the reconciled balance of receivables on invoices issued divided into "overdue" and not
"overdue".

The diversification of the sectors in which the Group's customers operate (Public Administration, Finance, Healthcare,
Industry and Services, Telco & Media, Energy & Utilities) constitutes an element mitigating the potential risk of credit
solvency, considering the current risk of creditworthiness, the economic context and the health emergency due to the
Covid-19 pandemic.

**Total** **518,155,646** **608,920,269** **(90,764,623)**

The item "Receivables from Customers” is equal to Euro 518.2 million, net of an allowance for bad debt amounting to
Euro 81.2 million, which was deemed adequate and sufficient to cover any future losses, in addition to allocation made
as provision for interest in arrears Euro 53.2 million to cover any probable future losses of the aforementioned item.

The doubtful accounts provision also includes the write-down of certain trade receivables for invoices to be issued in
the amount of approximately Euro 0.9 million referring to a prudential provision as described in the General
Information section to which reference should be made.

The change in the item "Receivables for invoices to be issued" is mainly attributable to the normal trend of accrued
revenues and invoices issued, as well as some reclassifications related to the application of IFRS 15.

The closing balance of the doubtful debt provision for trade receivables is reconciled with the opening balance as shown
below:

(in Euro)

**Trade receivables** **31.12.2022**

Allowance for bad debt as of 31.12.2021 (57,051,048)

Write-off of receivables considered non-recoverable 7,847,386

**Allowance for bad debt as of 31.12.2022** **(81,170,705)**

It is noted that, as of December 31, 2022 the Group factored trade receivables for the total amount of Euro 787.8 million
(Euro 90.2 million as of December 31, 2021). The transfer was non-recourse, so risks and benefits related to receivables
were transferred to the transferee; receivables were therefore written off from the Assets in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position, according to the consideration received by factoring companies.

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 84


-----

Receivables include the exposure as of December 31, 2022, with respect to Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and amount to Euro
131.1 million (gross of the allowance for bad debt amounting to Euro 37.8 million and the related allowance for bad
debt for interest on arrears equal to Euro 52.4 million), of which Euro 14.5 million are customer contracts assets,
resulting from IT activities associated with the building of an integrated IT platform for the Sicilian Regional Government
within the scope of the agreement signed between the Sicilian Regional Government, Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. (former Sicilia
E-Servizi S.p.A.) and Sicilia e Servizi Venture S.c.a.r.l. in liquidation on 21 May 2007 and expired on 22 December 2013.

The Directors, considering the legitimacy of the credit lines carried out and the correct execution of the services,
assessed the appraisal delivered by the Office Technical Experts as part of the summons to obtain payment of an amount
of their receivables equal to approximately Euro 79.7 million as seriously omissive and erroneous consider the receivable
from Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. to SISEV to be collectable.

In any case, considering the continuous change in institutional interlocutors and the difficulty in achieving an amicable
agreement, in view of a legal dispute and the objections filed by Sicilia Digitale S.p.A. and the Sicilian Region, in its
Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2022, the Group acknowledged the interest set out by law
pertaining to the period considered (Euro 5.7 million) in the income statement and under Financial income, in addition
to the amount already recognised as of 31 December 2021 (for a total amount of approx. Euro 52.4 million), and accrued
a bad debt provision for Euro 10.4 million in addition to the previous accruals for a total allowance for bad debt of
approximately Euro 90.2 million, which includes the total impairment of the statutory interest shown above and
recognised in the financial statements and, for the remaining portion, the impairment of the nominal value of the
receivables.

**COVENANTS**

The commitments/obligations set out in the contract for the loan granted by Banco BPM (loan amounting to Euro 15
million taken out on October 13, 2020), at a variable rate, reflect the provisions of the financial documentation signed
in the context of the acquisition transaction on July 23, 2020. In particular, the following Financial Parameters must be
complied with:

Test SSN FCCR (Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio): the fixed charge coverage ratio of the SSN Issuer ("FCCR") must be at least
2:1 pro-forma for the issue of the new debt. The calculation of the FCCR is detailed in the SSN Indenture and is essentially
the ratio between the SSN Issuer's LTM EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for acquisitions, disposals and run-rate synergies etc.
for the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters for which consolidated financial statements are available) and the
SSN Issuer's consolidated fixed expenses (i.e. interest expense plus all dividends accrued or paid in cash or otherwise).

Test PIK CTNLR (Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (PIK Notes)): the consolidated total net leverage ratio of the PIK
Issuer ("CTNLR") cannot exceed 5:1 pro-forma for the issue of the new debt. The calculation of the CTNLR is detailed in
the PIK indenture and is essentially the ratio between the consolidated total net debt of the PIK Issuer (i.e. all
indebtedness of the PIK Issuer and its subsidiaries excluding the indebtedness of the SSN Issuer incurred by virtue of
factoring, securitisations, asset-backed loans and borrowings and other similar financing and hedging obligations, but
including capitalised interest on the PIK Securities, less cash resulting from the PIK Issuer's financial statements on a
consolidated basis) and the PIK Issuer's LTM EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for acquisitions, disposals and run-rate synergies
etc.) for the last four consecutive fiscal quarters for which consolidated financial statements are available).

If the SSN Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries subject to restrictions, wants to secure the new debt ratio on the SSN
guarantee, in addition to fulfilling the FCCR and PIK CTNLR tests, the consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio
("CSSNLR") of the SSN Issuer cannot exceed 5:1 pro-forma for the issue of the new debt.

_Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022_ 89


-----

Test CSSNLR (Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (SSNs)): the consolidated senior secured net leverage
ratio ("CSSNLR") of the SSN Issuer cannot exceed 5:1 pro-forma for the issue of the new debt. The calculation of the
CSSNLR is detailed in the SSN indenture and is essentially the ratio between the consolidated senior secured net debt
of the SSN Issuer (i.e. all indebtedness guaranteed with SSN guarantee less cash resulting from the SSN Issuer's
consolidated financial statements) and the SSN Issuer's LTM EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for acquisitions, disposals and
run-rate synergies etc. for the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters for which consolidated financial statements
are available).

The financial parameters are revised twice yearly with reference to the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the
Consolidated Interim Report.

_(in Euro)_

**Description** **31.12.2022** **31.12.2021** **Changes**

Post-employment benefits 79,465,342 71,630,985 7,834,357

Due to the introduction of Italian Law No. 296 dated December 27, 2006 as well as subsequent decrees and regulations
issued in the first few months of 2007, the post-employment benefits (TFR) as of 1 January 2007 changed from a
"defined benefit plan" into a "defined contribution plan" as a consequence of the application of differing accounting
treatment of post-employment benefits accrued before or after 31 December 2006.

Post-employment benefits, accrued after January 1, 2007, represent a "defined contribution plan". Periodically, the
Company pays post-employment benefits accrued to a separate entity (e.g. INPS and/or a Fund) and with payment of
the contributions it fulfills the obligation to its employees. For accounting purposes, it is included under other
contributions, therefore the post-employment benefit matured is recorded as a cost in the period with the payable
recognised under short-term payables.

Post-employment benefits accrued up to December 31, 2006 continue to represent a "defined benefit plan" which is
more certain in terms of their existence and sum, but uncertain in terms of manifestation.
The total amount of the benefit obligation is calculated and certified on an annual basis by an independent actuary by
using the "Projected Unit Credit" method.

A summary of the actuarial assumptions adopted in measuring Post-employment benefits is provided below:

Financial Assumptions:

   - Future annual rates of inflation were set according to the average rates of inflation in Italy in recent years,
based on Office for National Statistics (ISTAT) data;

   - Future annual revaluation rates of existing provisions and subsequent payments fixed, as established by
regulations at 75% of the inflation rate plus 1.50% net of taxes;

   - The annual discount rates were established as variable from 1.8217% to 2.7261% and were deducted
adopting a rate curve combining the effective yield rates movements of the Euro Bonds of primary companies
with AA rating or higher.

Demographic assumptions:

   - To evaluate length of employment with the Company, the "Tavola di permanenza nella posizione di attivo"
RG48 (a table for company service length prepared by the Italian Treasury Department based on data for those
born in 1948) was used, selected, projected and separated by gender, supplemented with the probability of

measurable in terms of

The following tables show the absolute and relative changes in liabilities measured according to IAS 19 (DBO), while
assuming a 10% negative or positive change in the revaluation and/or discounting rates.

The Servify project aims at the creation of an Open Service Innovation Laboratory and the definition of an 18/11/2022 4,885,000
environment for the creation of "multi-sided market initiatives", enabling cooperation mechanisms
between companies in the T-KIBS (Technology - Knowledge Intensive Business Services) sector. The
laboratory represents the physical and virtual space where Open Innovation processes applied to services
can be implemented. These processes were tested through the use of the Living Lab methodology, a
user-centred methodology to identify, prototype, validate and refine complex solutions in multiple reallife contexts. The project focused on a new conceptual and technological service model, called
"Ubiquituum Service", which not only meets the ubiquity requirements typical of nomadic services, but
also ensures continuity ("continuum") and consistency in the user experience even when the context

changes. This service is "always-on" (without interruptions or barriers due to time, movement and the

simultaneous use of multiple services and devices); it is pervasive and immersive from a social and

Research)

technological point of view (i.e. able to engage users and harness their skills, knowledge and social
relationships through an immersive environment that makes them active participants).
The Ubiquituum Service has benefited from the evolution of mobile devices and the emergence of new
devices embedded in everyday objects, which make it possible to define new ways of using services,
through advanced models of human-machine interaction, and evolved models of social interaction, in
which objects, in line with Web 4.0, also provide information and value-added content.
More specifically, the project focuses on the concept of social sensor networks, an architecture that,
based on the characteristics and concepts of the Internet of Things, simplifies and improves the creation
of new services by exploiting the "relationships" that exist between these intelligent objects. **Total** **4,885,000**

Deferred taxes were calculated taking into account the cumulative amount of all temporary differences on the basis of
the average rates expected with reference to the subsequent tax periods in which these differences will reverse; for
details of the temporary differences that gave rise to deferred taxes, please refer to the previous sections "Deferred Tax
Receivables" and "Deferred Tax Payables".

The Change in the item "non-deductible expenses", the tax effect of which amounted to approximately Euro 27.1
million, as per the reconciliation statement of the theoretical-effective tax rate, is mainly attributable to provisions for
risks and charges and provisions for doubtful accounts.

The change in the item "non-taxable income", the tax effect of which amounted to approximately Euro 5.3 million, as
per the reconciliation statement of the theoretical-effective tax rate, was mainly attributable to income for research
grants, which, being taxable on a cash basis, resulted in a decrease in tax income.

**50** **Breakdown of financial instruments by category**

For all transactions the balances (financial or non-financial) for which an accounting standard requires or permits
measurement at fair value and which fall within the scope of IFRS 13, the Group applies the following criteria:
a) identification of the unit of account, i.e. the level at which an asset or liability is aggregated or disaggregated
to be recognised for IFRS purposes;
b) identification of the main market (or, in the absence thereof, the most advantageous market) in which
transactions could take place for the asset or liability being valued; in the absence of evidence to the contrary,
it is assumed that the market currently used coincides with the main market or, in the absence thereof, with
the most advantageous market;
c) definition, for non-financial assets, of the highest and best use: in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the
highest and best use coincides with the current use of the asset;

d) definition of the most appropriate valuation techniques for estimating fair value: these techniques maximise
the use of observable data, which market participants would use in determining the price of the asset or
liability;
e) determination of the fair value of the assets, as the price that would be received for their sale, and of the
liabilities and equity instruments, as the price that would be paid for their transfer in a regular transaction
between market participants at the valuation date;
f) inclusion of "non-performance risk" in the valuation of assets and liabilities and, in particular for financial
instruments, determination of an adjustment factor in the measurement of fair value to include, in addition to
counterparty risk (CVA - credit valuation adjustment), own credit risk (DVA - debit valuation adjustment).

On the basis of the data used for fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy is identified on the basis of which assets
and liabilities measured at fair value or for which fair value is indicated in the financial statement disclosures are
classified:

a) level 1: includes prices quoted in active markets for assets or liabilities identical to those being valued;
b) level 2: includes observable data, different from those included in level 1, such as: (i) prices quoted in active
markets for similar or identical assets or liabilities; (ii) prices quoted in non-active markets for similar or
identical assets or liabilities; (iii) other observable data (interest rate curves, implicit volatilities, credit spreads);
c) level 3: uses non-observable data, which may be used if no observable input data is available. The nonobservable data used for fair value measurement purposes reflects the assumptions that market participants
would make when pricing the assets and liabilities being measured.

Please refer to the table below for the definition of the fair value hierarchy level on the basis of which the individual
instruments measured at fair value have been classified.
No transfers between the different levels of the fair value hierarchy took place during the year.
The fair value of derivative instruments is determined by discounting expected cash-flows, using the market interest
rate curve at the reference date and the listed credit default swap curve of the counterparty and Group companies, to
include the non-performance risk explicitly provided for by IFRS 13.

For medium/long-term financial instruments, other than derivative instruments, where market prices are not available,
the fair value is determined by discounting expected cash-flows, using the market interest rate curve at the reference
date and considering the counterparty risk in the case of financial assets and its credit risk in the case of financial
liabilities.

Therefore, the following table highlights the measurement hierarchical level of fair value, for financial assets and
liabilities measured at fair value as of 31 December 2022:
