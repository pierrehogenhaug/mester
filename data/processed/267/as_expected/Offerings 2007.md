The Issuer may redeem some or all of each series of notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal
amount plus the applicable “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, prior to,
2010, the Issuer may redeem up to 35% of each series of notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings if at least

The notes will be general senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, will be effectively subordinated to all the
Issuer’s existing and future senior secured indebtedness, will be pari passu in right of payment with any of the
Issuer’s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and will be senior to the Issuer’s existing and any future
subordinated indebtedness. The notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by substantially all of the
Issuer’s direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries on the issue date and by TRWAutomotive Finance
(Luxembourg), SARL, its Luxembourg subsidiary. The notes will also be effectively subordinated to all liabilities
and preferred stock of each subsidiary of the Issuer that does not guarantee the notes.

_See “Risk factors” beginning on page 18 for a discussion of certain risks that you should consider in_
_connection with an investment in the notes._

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the
securities laws of any other place. The Issuer is offering the notes only to qualified institutional buyers under
Rule 144A and to persons outside the United States under Regulation S. The Issuer is not required to register to
exchange the notes for resale under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and is not
required to offer to exchange the notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction and the Issuer has no present intention to do so. For further details about eligible offerees and
resale restrictions, see “Notice to Investors”.

The dollar notes that are sold to qualified institutional buyers will be eligible for trading in the Private Offerings,
Resales and Trading through Automated Linkages Market (“PORTAL”). We intend to apply for the euro notes to be
admitted to trading on the Alternative Securities Market of the Irish Stock Exchange. However, we cannot assure you that
we will be able to list the euro notes on such exchange. If we do not list the euro notes on the Alternative Securities
Market of the Irish Stock Exchange, we intend to apply to list the euro notes on another exchange chosen by us in our sole
discretion.

This offering memorandum is not a “prospectus” for the purposes of European Union Directive (2003/71/EC)
(the “Prospectus Directive”).

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors in book-entry form through The Depository Trust
Company (in the case of the dollar notes) and through the Euroclear System and Clearstream (in the case of the euro
notes), in each case, on or about, 2007, which is the business day following the date of this
offering memorandum, subject to certain conditions. Purchasers of the notes should consider that trading of the
notes may be affected by this settlement date. See “Plan of Distribution”.

It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment thereof on or about the date specified in
the last paragraph of the cover page hereof, which will be the business day in the United States following
the date hereof. Pursuant to Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the “Exchange Act”, trades
in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers of notes who wish to trade notes on the date of pricing or the
next succeeding business day will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade
to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of notes who wish to trade notes on the date of pricing or the next
succeeding business day should consult their own advisors.

You should rely only upon the information contained in this offering memorandum. Neither we nor the initial
purchasers have authorized any other person to provide you with different information. If anyone provides you with
different or inconsistent information, you should not rely on it. Neither the Issuer nor any of the initial purchasers are
making an offer to sell these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted. You should assume the
information appearing in this offering memorandum is accurate only as of the date on the front cover of this offering
memorandum. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed since that date.

The Issuer is relying on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for offers and sales of
securities that do not involve a public offering. By purchasing notes, you will be deemed to have made the
acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements set forth under the heading “Notice to Investors” in
this offering memorandum. You should understand that you will be required to bear the financial risks of your
investment for an indefinite period of time. The initial purchasers are relying on exemptions from the provisions of
Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A and Regulation S in connection with the initial resale of the
notes. These notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold in the
United States except as permitted under applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws pursuant to a registration
statement or an exemption from registration. The Issuer is not required to register to exchange the notes for resale
under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and is not required to offer to exchange the
notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and the Issuer has
no present intention to do so.

**OFFERING MEMORANDUM SUMMARY**

_The following summary is qualified in its entirety by and should be read in conjunction with the detailed_
_information and financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this offering memorandum and in_
_the documents incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. You should carefully consider the matters_
_discussed under the caption “Risk Factors”. Except as the context otherwise requires, data in this offering_
_memorandum assumes that the tender offers described below under “Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations” and_
_this offering have been consummated. The terms the “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us”, except as otherwise_
_indicated in this offering memorandum or as the context otherwise requires, refer to TRW Automotive Holdings_
_Corp. (“Holdings”) and its subsidiaries. The term “Issuer” refers to TRW Automotive Inc._

**The Company**

We are among the world’s largest and most diversified suppliers of automotive systems, modules and
components to global automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and related aftermarkets. We
conduct substantially all of our operations through the Issuer and its subsidiaries. These operations primarily
encompass the design, manufacture and sale of active and passive safety related products. Active safety related
products principally refer to vehicle dynamic controls (primarily braking and steering), and passive safety related
products principally refer to occupant restraints (primarily air bags and seat belts) and safety electronics (electronic
control units and crash and occupant weight sensors). We are primarily a “Tier 1” supplier, with approximately 86%
of our end-customer sales in 2006 to major OEMs. We operate our business along three segments: Chassis Systems,
Occupant Safety Systems and Automotive Components. Holdings owns no material assets other than the equity
interests in TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings Corp., which owns no material assets other than the equity
interests in the Issuer.

**Financial and Operating Information**

Financial information contained herein represents historical consolidated financial information for Holdings.
The only material difference between Holdings and the Issuer is a $499,000,000 original principal promissory note
payable to the Issuer by its direct parent, TRWAutomotive Intermediate Holdings Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary
of Holdings. The promissory note bears interest at 9.5% per annum, which is paid in kind. Such promissory note and
related interest income earned by the Issuer is eliminated in consolidation. Therefore, neither this promissory note
payable to the Issuer nor related interest income is included in the financial information contained herein.

The consolidated historical financial information contained herein should be read in conjunction with the 2006
10-K incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum.

_Segment Information._ We conduct substantially all of our operations through the Issuer and its subsidiaries
and along three segments: Chassis Systems, Occupant Safety Systems and Automotive Components. The table
below summarizes certain financial information for our segments.

**Business Developments and Industry Trends**

_Business Development and Strategy._ We have become a leader in the global automotive parts industry by
capitalizing on the strength of our products, technological capabilities and systems integration skills. Over the last
decade, we have experienced sales growth in many of our product lines due to an increasing focus by both
governments and consumers on safety and fuel efficiency. We believe that this trend is continuing as evidenced by
ongoing regulatory activities and escalating fuel costs, and will enable us to experience growth in the most recent
generation of advanced safety and fuel efficient products. Such advanced products include vehicle stability control
systems, curtain and side air bags, occupant sensing systems, electrically assisted power steering systems and tire
pressure monitoring systems.

Throughout our long history as a leading supplier to major OEMs, we have focused on products where we have
a technological advantage. We have extensive technical experience in a focused range of safety-related product
lines and strong systems integration skills. These traits enable us to provide comprehensive, systems-based
solutions for our OEM customers. We have a broad and established global presence and sell to major OEMs across
all of the world’s major vehicle producing regions, including the rapidly expanding Chinese and Indian markets. We
believe our business diversification mitigates our exposure to the risks of any one geographic economy, product line
or major customer concentration. It also enables us to extend our portfolio of products and new technologies across
our customer base and geographic regions, and provides us the necessary scale to optimize our cost structure.

We continually consider and may pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses or technologies that could
complement, enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth
opportunities. Depending on the circumstances, any acquisition or business combination could be affected by
us (including the Issuer) or by any of our affiliates. Such acquisitions or business combinations could change the
credit profile of the Company in significant respects, and could involve the incurrence of substantial additional
indebtedness and significant fees and expenses, and/or the making of substantial distributions of cash, properties or
other assets, none of which would be restricted by the terms of the indentures or the notes.

_The Automotive Industry Climate._ The following key trends have been affecting the automotive parts
industry over the past several years, many of which we expect to continue in the near term. (The statements
_regarding industry outlook, trends, the future development of certain automotive systems and other non-historical_
_statements contained in this section are forward-looking statements.)_

These developments and trends include:

   - a decline in market share and significant announced production cuts among some of our largest customers,
including the North American operations of Ford Motor Company, General Motors Corporation and the
Chrysler group of DaimlerChrysler AG (the “Big Three”);

   - the deteriorating financial condition of certain of our customers and the resulting uncertainty as they undergo
(or contemplate undergoing) restructuring initiatives, including in certain cases, significant capacity
reductions and/or reorganization under bankruptcy laws;

   - the continued rise in inflationary pressures impacting certain commodities such as petroleum-based
products, resins, yarns, ferrous metals, aluminum, base metals and other chemicals;

   - a consumer shift in the North American market away from sport utility vehicles and light trucks to more fuel
efficient cross-over utility vehicles and passenger cars;

   - the growing concerns over the economic viability of our Tier 2 and Tier 3 supply base as they face
inflationary pressures and financial instability in certain of their customers;

  - continuing pricing pressure from OEMs and efforts by our customers to change contract terms and
conditions concerning warranty and recall participation; and

   - volatility of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, mainly the Euro.

These developments and trends are discussed in detail in “Part II, Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the 2006 10-K incorporated by reference in this
offering memorandum.

In addition, the following are significant characteristics of the automotive and automotive supply industries.

   - Consumer and Regulatory Focus on Safety. Consumers, and therefore OEMs, are increasingly focused on,
and governments are increasingly requiring, improved safety in vehicles. For example, the Alliance of
Automobile Manufacturers and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety announced voluntary performance criteria which encompass a wide range of occupant protection technologies and designs, including
enhanced matching of vehicle front structural components and enhanced side-impact protection through the
use of features such as side air bags, air bag curtains and revised side-impact structures. By September 1,
2007, at least 50% of all vehicles offered in the United States by participating manufacturers are expected to
meet the front-to-side performance criteria, and by September 2009, 100% of the vehicles of participating
manufacturers are expected to meet the criteria.

In September 2006, the National Highway Safety Traffic Administration (“NHTSA”) issued a Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking proposing standard fitment of electronic stability control (“ESC”) on all North
American vehicles under 10,000 lbs. gross vehicle weight no later than September 2011. The proposal
includes a phase-in plan, with ESC to be fitted on 30% of new vehicle production by September 2008, 60% by
September 2009, and 90% by September 2010. The final rule is expected to be issued in the first quarter of
2008.

In October 2005, NHTSA updated its mandate for the assembly onto vehicles of a direct tire pressure
monitoring system, capable of detecting when one or more tires are significantly under-inflated. The phase-in
period for compliance is as follows: 20% of light vehicles are required to comply with the standard during the
period from October 5, 2005 to August 31, 2006; 70% during the period from September 1, 2006 to August 21,
2007; and all light vehicles thereafter.

Advances in technology by us and others have led to a number of innovations in our product portfolio, which
will allow us to benefit from this trend. Such innovations include electronic vehicle stability control systems,
tire pressure monitoring systems, occupant sensing systems, rollover sensing and curtain air bag systems.

   - Globalization of Suppliers. To serve multiple markets more cost effectively, many OEMs are manufacturing global vehicle platforms, which typically are designed in one location but are produced and sold in
many different geographic markets around the world. Having operations in the geographic markets in which
OEMs produce global platforms enables suppliers to meet OEMs’ needs more economically and efficiently.

Few suppliers have this global coverage, and it is a source of significant competitive advantage for those
suppliers that do.

   - Shift of Engineering to Suppliers. Increasingly, OEMs are focusing their efforts on consumer brand
development and overall vehicle design, as opposed to the design of individual vehicle systems. In order to
simplify the vehicle design and assembly processes and reduce their costs, OEMs increasingly look to their
suppliers to provide fully engineered, combinations of components in systems and modules rather than
individual components. Systems and modules increase the importance of Tier 1 suppliers because they
generally increase the Tier 1 suppliers’ percentage of vehicle content.

We have also seen certain vehicle manufacturers shift away from their funding of development contracts for
new technology. We expect this trend to continue in 2007, thereby causing our engineering and research and
development expenses to increase.

   - Increased Electronic Content and Electronics Integration. The electronic content of vehicles has been
increasing and, we believe, will continue to increase in the future. Consumer and regulatory requirements in
Europe and the United States for improved automotive safety and environmental performance, as well as
consumer demand for increased vehicle performance and functionality at lower cost largely drive the
increase in electronic content. Electronics integration generally refers to replacing mechanical with
electronic components and integration of mechanical and electrical functions within the vehicle. This

10

allows OEMs to achieve a reduction in the weight of vehicles and the number of mechanical parts, resulting
in easier assembly, enhanced fuel economy, improved emissions control, increased safety and better vehicle
performance. As consumers seek more competitively-priced ride and handling performance, safety, security
and convenience options in vehicles, such as electronic stability control, active cruise control, air bags,
keyless entry and tire pressure monitoring, we believe that electronic content per vehicle will continue to
increase.

   - Increased Emphasis on Speed to Market. As OEMs are under increasing pressure to adjust to changing
consumer preferences and to incorporate technological advances, they are shortening product development
times. Shorter product development times also generally reduce product development costs. We believe
suppliers that are able to deliver new products to OEMs in a timely fashion to accommodate the OEMs’
needs will be well-positioned to succeed in this evolving marketplace.

**Debt Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations**

The Issuer intends to offer to repurchase its outstanding 9[3]⁄8% Senior Notes due 2013 ($825,377,000 aggregate
principal amount outstanding), its outstanding 10[1]⁄8% Senior Notes due 2013 (A130,000,000 aggregate principal
amount outstanding), its outstanding 11% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 ($195,000,000 aggregate principal
amount outstanding) and its outstanding 11[3]⁄4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 (A81,250,000 aggregate
principal amount outstanding) (collectively, the “Existing Notes”), in each case pursuant to a tender offer. In
conjunction with such tender offers, the Issuer also intends to commence consent solicitations to eliminate
substantially all of the covenants and certain events of default in the indentures governing the Existing Notes. The
tender offers will be conditioned upon, among other things (i) the valid tender of not less than a majority in
aggregate principal amount of each series of Existing Notes, (ii) the receipt of consents from holders of not less than
a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of Existing Notes consenting to amendments to the
applicable indentures for such Existing Notes, (iii) the successful raising or placing of debt financing to finance the
tender offers on conditions acceptable to the Issuer and (iv) other customary conditions. Closing of this offering is
conditioned upon the Issuer receiving the requisite consents to the consent solicitations described above. The
proceeds of this offering will be utilized to repurchase the Existing Notes pursuant to the tender offers. Following
completion of this offering, to the extent that all Existing Notes are not tendered in the tender offers, the Issuer
intends to use any remaining net proceeds from this offering to repay such Existing Notes at maturity or, at its
discretion, to redeem or defease such Existing Notes under the terms of the indentures governing the Existing Notes.
We expect that if both the tender offers and this offering are successful, we will reduce our interest expense and
extend the maturity dates on our debt.

Unless otherwise specified in this offering memorandum, we have assumed that 100% of the Existing Notes
will be validly tendered and accepted for purchase in the tender offers.

Our principal executive offices are located at 12001 Tech Center Drive, Livonia, Michigan 48150, and our
telephone number is (734) 855-2600. Our website address is http://www.trwauto.com. Information contained on

**Summary Financial Data**
The following tables set forth certain summary condensed consolidated financial data. The summary financial
information presented below for each of the three years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, and as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, has been derived from the financial statements incorporated by reference in this
offering memorandum. You should read the information in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements of TRW
Automotive Holdings Corp. included in the 2006 10-K incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum.

Financial information contained herein represents historical financial information for Holdings. The only
material difference between Holdings and the Issuer is a $499,000,000 original principal promissory note payable to
the Issuer by its direct parent, TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Holdings. The promissory note bears interest at 9.5% per annum, which is paid in kind. Such promissory note and
related interest income earned by the Issuer is eliminated in consolidation. Therefore, neither this promissory note
payable to the Issuer nor related interest income is included in the financial information contained herein.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Your investment in the notes will involve risk. Before you decide to purchase any notes, you should carefully_
_consider the following risk factors and other information contained, or incorporated by reference, into this offering_
_memorandum._

**Risks Relating to the Notes**

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, and_**
**_may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be_**
**_successful._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and
operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial,
business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating
activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
Capital Resources” in the 2006 10-K incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to
reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our
indebtedness, including the notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet
our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face
substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt
service and other obligations. The Issuer’s senior credit facilities restrict our ability to sell assets and use the
proceeds from the sales. We may not be able to consummate those sales or to obtain the proceeds which we could
realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness — Senior Credit Facilities”.

**_We are a holding company with no independent operations. Our ability to repay our debt depends upon_**
**_the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions to us._**

All of our operations will be conducted by our subsidiaries and, therefore, our cash flow and our ability to
service our indebtedness, including our ability to pay the interest on and principal of the notes when due, will be
dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries. Any payment of
dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on dividends
or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law and monetary transfer restrictions in the jurisdictions in which
our subsidiaries operate. In addition, payments to us by our subsidiaries will be contingent upon our subsidiaries’
earnings.

Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, except for our subsidiary guarantors, they will have
no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the notes or to make any funds available to pay
those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payments.

**_Your right to receive payments on each issue of notes is junior to those lenders who have a security inter-_**
**_est in our assets._**

The Issuer’s obligations under the notes and the guarantors’ obligations under their respective guarantees of the
notes are unsecured, but the Issuer’s obligations under its senior credit facilities and each guarantor’s obligations
under their respective guarantees of the senior credit facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all of
our domestic tangible and intangible assets (other than receivables sold to the Issuer’s receivables subsidiaries in
connection with our receivables facility) and the assets and a portion of the stock of certain of our foreign
subsidiaries. If we are declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if we default under the Issuer’s senior credit facilities, the
lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and
payable. If we were unable to repay such indebtedness, the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the
exclusion of holders of the notes, even if an event of default exists under the indentures under which the notes will be

18


-----

issued at such time. Furthermore, if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary
guarantor under the notes, then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the notes automatically upon the
applicable subsidiary guarantor ceasing to be a subsidiary as a result of any such foreclosure of any pledge or
security interest or other exercise of remedies in respect thereof. In any such event, because the notes will not be
secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors, it is possible that there would be no
assets remaining from which your claims could be satisfied or, if any assets remained, they might be insufficient to
satisfy your claims fully. Additionally, to the extent any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries sell receivables pursuant to our
receivables facility, payments made in respect of those interests will not be available to make payments in respect of
the notes. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”.

As of December 31, 2006, assuming the Issuer had completed this offering and applied the proceeds therefrom
as set forth under “Use of Proceeds” and that 100% of the Existing Notes were validly tendered and accepted for
purchase in the tender offers, the Issuer would have had approximately $1,582 million of senior secured
indebtedness (all of which is indebtedness under its senior credit facilities and which does not include availability
of approximately $830 million under the revolving credit facility). The indentures will permit the incurrence of
substantial additional indebtedness by the Issuer and its subsidiaries in the future, including secured indebtedness.

**_Claims of noteholders will be structurally subordinate to claims of creditors of the Issuer’s non-U.S. sub-_**
**_sidiaries (other than TRW Automotive (Luxembourg) SARL) and the Issuer’s receivables and captive_**
**_insurance subsidiaries because they will not guarantee the notes._**

The notes will not be guaranteed by any of the Issuer’s less than wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries,
non-U.S. subsidiaries (other than TRW Automotive (Luxembourg) SARL) or receivables subsidiaries and captive
insurance subsidiaries as described in “Description of the Notes — Guarantees” and “Description of the Notes —
Certain Covenants — Future Guarantors”. Accordingly, claims of holders of the notes will be structurally
subordinate to the claims of creditors of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, claims of holders of the notes will also be structurally subordinate to claims
of the lenders under the Issuer’s senior credit facilities to the extent of the guarantees by non-U.S. subsidiaries of the
senior credit facilities. All obligations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries will have to be satisfied before any of the
assets of such subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to the Issuer or a
guarantor of the notes.

We also have joint ventures and subsidiaries in which we own less than 100% of the equity so that, in addition
to the structurally senior claims of creditors of those entities, the equity interests of our joint venture partners or
other shareholders in any dividend or other distribution made by these entities would need to be satisfied on a
proportionate basis with us. These joint ventures and less than wholly-owned subsidiaries may also be subject to
restrictions on their ability to distribute cash to us in their financing or other agreements and, as a result, we may not
be able to access their cash flow to service our debt obligations, including in respect of the notes.

**_Although we do not separately compile financial information for guarantor versus non-guarantor subsid-_**
**_iaries, the assets and liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries are substantial._**

We report financial information on a consolidated basis through the Issuer’s indirect parent, Holdings. We do
not now (nor do we intend to after the issuance of the notes) separately produce financial information for guarantor
versus non-guarantor subsidiaries.

However, 72% of our 2006 sales originated outside of the United States and so can be assumed to have arisen
out of the non-guarantor subsidiaries. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, the non-guarantor subsidiaries had
approximately $163 million of third party indebtedness (excluding inter-company debt). For the purposes of your
purchase of the notes, you should assume that a substantial portion of our sales, profits, assets and liabilities are
attributable to non-guarantor subsidiaries and that the assets and sales of the guarantor subsidiaries may not be
sufficient to satisfy the claims of a noteholder upon default of the notes. See also ‘‘— Claims of noteholders will be
structurally subordinate to claims of creditors of the Issuer’s non-U.S. subsidiaries (other than TRW Automotive
(Luxembourg) SARL), receivables subsidiaries and captive insurance subsidiaries because they will not guarantee
the notes.”

-----

**_If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on_**
**_the notes._**

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the Issuer’s senior
credit facilities that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such
indebtedness could make the Issuer unable to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the notes and
substantially decrease the market value of the notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are
otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on
our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating
covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness (including the Issuer’s senior credit facilities), we could
be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the
holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under the Issuer’s revolving credit facility could elect to
terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets,
and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future
need to seek to obtain waivers from the required lenders under the Issuer’s senior credit facilities to avoid being in
default. If we breach our covenants under the Issuer’s senior credit facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to
obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under the Issuer’s senior credit
facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or
liquidation. See “Description of Other Indebtedness — Senior Credit Facilities”, and “Description of the Notes”.

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control coupled with a ratings decline._**

Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, if the credit rating assigned to the notes
declines beyond specified levels within 90 days of the change of control, the Issuer will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, unless such
notes have been previously called for redemption. The Issuer may not have sufficient financial resources to
purchase all of the notes that are tendered upon a change of control offer. The occurrence of a change of control
triggering event would also constitute an event of default under the Issuer’s senior credit facilities. The Issuer’s bank
lenders may have the right to prohibit any such purchase or redemption, in which event the Issuer will seek to obtain
waivers from the required lenders under the senior credit facilities, but may not be able to do so. See “Description of
the Notes — Change of Control Triggering Event”.

**_Despite our current leverage, we will be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate_**
**_the risks described above._**

We will be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indentures governing
the notes will limit our ability to incur secured indebtedness, the indentures will not limit the amount of unsecured
indebtedness that we may incur in the future. In addition, the covenants limiting our ability to incur secured
indebtedness have numerous exceptions, including an exception that permits us to incur, without limitation, secured
indebtedness under existing or future customary bank or loan facilities. The Issuer’s revolving credit facility
provides commitments of up to $900 million, $830 million of which was available for future borrowings as of
December 31, 2006. Our receivables facility provides for advances of up to $209 million, based on availability of
eligible receivables. As of December 31, 2006, there were no advances outstanding under our receivables facility.
All of those borrowings would be secured, and as a result, effectively senior to the notes and the guarantees of the
notes by our subsidiary guarantors. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes, the
holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the notes in any proceeds distributed in
connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of us. This may have
the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related
risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.

20


-----

**_We may engage in acquisitions, business combinations, joint ventures and other transactions that may_**
**_complement or expand our business. We may not be able to complete such transactions and such transac-_**
**_tions, if executed, may pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations._**

We continually consider and may pursue opportunities to enter into joint ventures and to buy or combine with
other businesses that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise
offer us growth opportunities. Our ability to acquire targets or consummate business combinations may be limited
by applicable antitrust laws and other regulations in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions in
which we do business. To the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions or consummating business
combinations, we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash, incur debt, make substantial distributions of
cash, properties or other assets and incur other types of expenses. Such additional obligations may affect the Issuer’s
ability to make payments on the notes and our ability to service the additional indebtedness incurred in connection
with such transactions.

**_You may face foreign exchange risks or tax consequences by investing in the euro notes._**

If you are a U.S. investor, an investment in the euro notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to,
among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of
economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar
could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the euro notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a
loss to you on a U.S. dollar basis. Investing in the euro notes by U.S. investors may also have important tax
consequences. See “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences — Consequences to U.S. Holders —
Euro notes.”

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court to void the notes and the guarantees, and, if_**
**_that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes._**

The issuance of the notes and the guarantees may be subject to review under federal and state fraudulent
transfer and conveyance statutes. While the relevant laws may vary from state to state, under such laws the payment
of consideration will be a fraudulent conveyance if (1) the Issuer paid the consideration with the intent of hindering,
delaying or defrauding creditors or (2) the Issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than
reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee, and, in the case
of (2) only, one of the following is also true:

   - the Issuer or any of the guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence of the
indebtedness; or

   - payment of the consideration left the Issuer or any of the guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of
capital to carry on the business; or

   - the Issuer or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that it would, incur debts beyond its ability to pay
as they mature.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance, the court could
void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently
existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or such guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any
amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance
occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of
default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt that could result in acceleration of such debt.

Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair salable value of all its assets; or

   - the present fair salable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable
liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

   - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

21


-----

We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or the
guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or regardless of the standard that a court uses, that the issuance of the
notes and the guarantees would not be further subordinated to the Issuer’s or any of the guarantors’ other debt.

If the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could also be subject to the claim that, since the
guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of
the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration. A court could thus void the obligations under
the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the
holders of the notes.

**_There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes without registration under applicable_**
**_securities laws._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under United States and
applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a
transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the United States and applicable state
securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. See
“Notice to Investors”.

**_Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and there is_**
**_no assurance that any active trading market will develop for the notes._**

The notes are new issues of securities for which there is no established public market. We intend to apply for
the euro notes to be admitted to trading on the Alternative Securities Market of the Irish Stock Exchange. However,
we cannot assure you that we will be able to list the euro notes on such exchange. If we do not list the euro notes on
the Alternative Securities Market of the Irish Stock Exchange, we intend to apply to list the euro notes on another
exchange chosen by us in our sole discretion. We expect the dollar notes to be eligible for trading by “qualified
institutional buyers”, as defined under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, in PORTAL. The initial purchasers have
advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations; however,
the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes, and they may discontinue their market-making
activities at any time without notice. Therefore, we cannot assure you that an active market for the notes will
develop or, if developed, that it will continue. Historically, the market for noninvestment grade debt has been subject
to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if
any, for the notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at
which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuances, the notes may trade at discounts
from their initial offering prices, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our financial
and operating performance and other factors.

**_Ratings for the notes may not reflect all risks of an investment in the notes._**

The notes will be rated by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. Any rating is not a
recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any particular security, including the notes. These ratings do not comment
as to market price or suitability for a particular investor. In addition, ratings at any time may be lowered or
withdrawn in their entirety. The ratings for the notes may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to
structure and other factors on any trading market for, or trading value of, your notes.

In addition, although the notes are expected to be rated below investment grade at the time of this offering by
both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service, they lack the protection for holders of a number of
restrictive covenants typically associated with comparably rated public debt securities, including the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, payment of dividends and other restricted payments, sale of assets and the use of proceeds
therefrom, transactions with affiliates and dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries. In
addition, the covenant limiting the ability of the Issuer and its subsidiaries to incur secured indebtedness has
numerous exceptions, including an exception that permits the Issuer and its subsidiaries to incur, without limitation,
secured indebtedness under existing or future customary bank or loan facilities.

22


-----

**_In certain circumstances, you should not rely on the “change of control” provision contained in the_**
**_indentures governing the notes to protect you from the Company engaging in transactions to sell our_**
**_business._**

The indentures governing the notes include a provision that requires the Issuer to offer to repurchase all
outstanding notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of
specific kinds of change of control events, if the credit rating assigned to the notes declines beyond specified levels
within 90 days of the change of control event. The notes define these “change of control” events to exclude, among
other things, a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries to a third party in which no
other third party (other than Blackstone or our management group) owns a majority of such third party’s stock.
Therefore, the “change of control” provision would not apply to a sale of all or substantially all the assets of the
Issuer and its subsidiaries to such a third party. As a result, it would be relatively simple for the Company to structure
a transaction to sell our business to such a third party and avoid having to comply with the “change of control”
provision. Accordingly, you should not rely on the “change of control” provision contained in the indentures
governing the notes to protect you from the Company engaging in such a transaction. See “Description of Notes —
Change of Control Triggering Event”.

**Risks Relating to Our Business**

**_Loss of market share by the Big Three may adversely affect our results in the future._**

Ford Motor Company, General Motors and the Chrysler group of DaimlerChrysler AG (the “Big Three”) have
been losing market share for vehicle sales in North America and, to a lesser extent, Europe. At the same time, Asian
vehicle manufacturers have increased their share in such markets. Although we do have business with the Asian
vehicle manufacturers, our customer base is more heavily weighted towards the Big Three. In addition, declining
market share and inherent structural issues with the Big Three have led to recent announcements of an unprecedented level of production cuts. In order to address market share declines, reduced production levels, negative
industry trends and other structural issues specific to their companies (such as significant overcapacity and pension
and healthcare costs), the Big Three and certain of our other customers are undergoing various forms of
restructuring initiatives (including, in certain cases, reorganization under bankruptcy laws). In the case of Ford,
North American restructuring actions were accelerated and expanded during 2006 to remove additional production
capacity over the next several years. In the case of the Chrysler group, in February 2007, Chrysler announced
restructuring actions to significantly reduce overall North American production capacity. Such substantial
restructuring initiatives undertaken by our major customers will have a ripple effect throughout our industry
and may have a severe impact on our business and our common suppliers.

**_Escalating pricing pressures from our customers may adversely affect our business._**

Pricing pressure in the automotive supply industry has been substantial and is likely to continue. Virtually all
vehicle manufacturers seek price reductions in both the initial bidding process and during the term of the contract.
Price reductions have impacted our sales and profit margins and are expected to do so in the future. If we are not able
to offset continued price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, those price
reductions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

**_Commodity inflationary pressures may adversely affect our profitability and the viability of our Tier 2_**
**_and Tier 3 supply base._**

The cost of some of the commodities we use in our business has increased. Ferrous metals, base metals, resins,
yarns, energy costs and other petroleum-based products have become more expensive. This has put significant
operational and financial burdens on us and our suppliers. It is usually difficult to pass increased prices for
manufactured components and raw materials through to our customers in the form of price increases. Furthermore,
our suppliers may not be able to handle the commodity cost increases and still perform as we expect. In fact, we
have seen the number of bankruptcies or insolvencies increase due in part to the recent inflationary pressures. The
unstable condition of some of our suppliers or their failure to perform has led to certain delivery delays and
production issues and has negatively impacted certain of our businesses in 2006. The overall condition of our supply

23


-----

base may possibly lead to further delivery delays, production issues or delivery of non-conforming products by our
suppliers in the future.

**_Our business would be materially and adversely affected if we lost any of our largest customers._**

For the year ended December 31, 2006, sales to our four largest customers on a worldwide basis were
approximately 55% of our total sales. Although business with each customer is typically split among numerous
contracts, if we lost a major customer or that customer significantly reduced its purchases of our products, there
could be a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Work stoppages or other labor issues at the facilities of our customers or other suppliers could adversely_**
**_affect our operations._**

The turbulence in the automotive industry and actions taken by our customers and other suppliers to address
negative industry trends may have the side effect of exacerbating labor relations problems at those companies. If any
of our customers experience a material work stoppage, that customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products.
Similarly, a work stoppage at another supplier could interrupt production at our customer which would have the
same effect. This could cause us to shut down production facilities relating to those products, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, warranty and recall claims that_**
**_may be brought against us._**

In our business, we are exposed to product liability and warranty claims. In addition, we may be required to
participate in a recall of a product. Vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution
when faced with product liability, warranty and recall claims and we have been subject to continuing efforts by our
customers to change contract terms and conditions concerning warranty and recall participation. In addition,
vehicle manufacturers have experienced increasing recall campaigns in recent years. Product liability, warranty and
recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt costs to_**
**_increase significantly._**

A significant portion of our borrowings, including borrowings under the Issuer’s senior credit facilities, are at
variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 55% of our
total debt was at variable interest rates (or 71% when considering the effect of interest rate swaps) or, after giving
effect to the offering of the notes, the application of the net proceeds and the unwinding of the related interest rate
swaps in February 2007, 51%. In view of recent rising interest rates, the amount we are required to pay on our
variable rate indebtedness has increased and may increase further even though the amount borrowed remained the
same.

**_Strengthening of the U.S. dollar could materially impact our results of operations._**

In 2006, over half of our sales originated outside the United States. We translate sales and other results
denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements. This translation is
based on average exchange rates during a reporting period. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported
international sales and earnings would be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer U.S. dollars.

**_Our available cash and access to additional capital may be limited by our substantial debt._**

We have a significant amount of debt. This amount of debt may limit our ability to obtain additional financing
for our business. It may also limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions because of the covenants and
restrictions in the debt. In addition, we have to devote substantial cash to the payment of interest and principal on the
debt, which means that cash may not be used for other of our business needs. We may be more vulnerable to an
economic or industry downturn than a company with less debt.

24


-----

**_The cyclicality of automotive production and sales could adversely affect our business._**

Automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions, consumer
spending and preferences, labor relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements and other factors. The
volume of automotive production has fluctuated from year to year, which leads to fluctuations in the demand for our
products. Any significant economic decline that results in a reduction in automotive production and sales by vehicle
manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

**_Our pension and other post-retirement benefits expense and the funding requirements of our pension_**
**_plans could materially increase._**

Most of our employees participate in defined benefit pension plans or retirement/termination indemnity plans.
The rate at which we are required to fund these plans depends on certain assumptions which depend in part on
market conditions. As market conditions change, these assumptions may change, resulting in a decline in pension
asset values. Future declines could materially increase the necessary funding status of our plans, and may require us
to contribute more to these plans earlier than we anticipated. Also, this could significantly increase our pension
expenses and reduce our profitability.

We also sponsor other post-retirement benefit (“OPEB”) plans for most of our U.S. and some of our
non-U.S. employees. We fund our OPEB obligations on a pay-as-you-go basis and have no plan assets. If health
care costs in the future increase more than we anticipated, our actuarially determined liability and our related OPEB
expense could increase along with future cash outlays.

**_We are subject to risks associated with our non-U.S. operations._**

We have significant manufacturing operations outside the United States, including joint ventures and other
alliances. International operations involve risks, including exchange controls and currency restrictions, currency
fluctuations and devaluations, changes in local economic conditions, changes in laws and regulations and unsettled
political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against United States’ or other interests.

These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, which may_**
**_become impaired in the future._**

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, including customer
relationships, trademarks and developed technologies. Goodwill and other net identifiable intangible assets were
approximately $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2006, or 27% of our total assets. Goodwill, which represents the
excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of the businesses acquired, was approximately $2.3 billion as of
December 31, 2006, or 20% of our total assets.

Impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may result from, among other things,
deterioration in our performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations,
including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products sold by our business, and a variety of other
factors. The amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge that is included in
operating income. We are subject to financial statement risk in the event that goodwill or other identifiable
intangible assets become impaired.

**_Our expected annual effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in_**
**_mix of earnings and other factors._**

The overall effective tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of our total earnings before tax.
However, tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity
basis. Losses in certain jurisdictions provide no current financial statement tax benefit. In addition, certain taxing
jurisdictions have statutory rates greater than or less than the United States. As a result, changes in the mix of

25


-----

projected earnings between jurisdictions, among other factors, could have a significant impact on our overall
effective tax rate.

**_We may be adversely affected by environmental and safety regulations or concerns._**

Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change
frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws
and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws
and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved,
which difference may be material. We have spent money to comply with environmental requirements. In addition,
certain of our subsidiaries are subject to pending litigation raising various environmental and human health and
safety claims, including certain asbestos-related claims. While our annual costs to defend and settle these claims in
the past have not been material, we cannot assure you that this will remain so in the future.

**_Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially_**
**_impact our business._**

We own significant intellectual property, including a large number of patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade
secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in
maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Developments or assertions by or
against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business.

**_Because Blackstone controls us, the influence of our public shareholders over significant corporate_**
**_actions will be limited, and conflicts of interest between Blackstone and us or our public shareholders_**
**_could arise in the future._**

Currently an affiliate of The Blackstone Group L.P. (“Blackstone”) beneficially owns approximately 57% of
our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, Blackstone has the power to control all matters submitted to
our stockholders, elect our directors and exercise control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction
and has the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of stockholders regardless of whether or not
other stockholders believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**_Senior Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes_**

The Issuer issued the Existing Notes (consisting of the Senior Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes) in
2003. The Senior Notes consist of 9[3]⁄8% Senior Notes and 10[1]⁄8% Senior Notes in original principal amounts of
$925 million and A200 million, respectively. The Senior Subordinated Notes consist of 11% Senior Subordinated
Notes and 11[3]⁄4% Senior Subordinated Notes in original principal amounts of $300 million and A125 million,
respectively. Interest is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 and maturity is February 15, 2013.
The Senior Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis and the Senior Subordinated Notes are
guaranteed on a senior subordinated unsecured basis, in each case by substantially all the Issuer’s existing and future
wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and by TRW Automotive Finance (Luxembourg), SARL, a restricted Luxembourg subsidiary.

On May 3, 2005, we repurchased approximately A48 million principal amount of the 10[1]⁄8% Senior Notes with
a portion of the proceeds from the issuance by TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. of Common Stock in the first
quarter of 2005. In the first quarter of 2004, we used approximately $317 million of the proceeds from the initial
public offering of TRWAutomotive Holdings Corp. to repay a portion of each of the dollar and euro Senior Notes
and Senior Subordinated Notes, in each case including the payment of a related redemption premium thereon.

_Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations for Existing Notes._ The Issuer intends to commence cash tender
offers to repurchase the Existing Notes. The tender offers are conditioned upon, among other things (i) the valid
tender of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of Existing Notes, (ii) the receipt of
consents from holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of Existing Notes
consenting to amendments to the applicable indentures for such Existing Notes, (iii) the successful raising or
placing of debt financing to finance the tender offers on conditions acceptable to the Issuer, and (iv) other customary
conditions. The Issuer intends to use the proceeds from this offering to purchase the Existing Notes pursuant to the
cash tender offers and to pay related fees and expenses. Following completion of this offering, to the extent that all
Existing Notes are not tendered in the tender offers, the Issuer intends to use any remaining net proceeds from this
offering to repay such notes at maturity or, at its discretion, to redeem or defease such notes under the terms of the
indentures governing the Existing Notes.

**_Credit Facilities_**

_Senior Credit Facilities._ On December 21, 2004, we entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement dated as of December 17, 2004 with the lenders party thereto. The amended and restated credit
agreement provides for $1.9 billion in senior secured credit facilities, consisting of (i) a 5-year $900 million
revolving credit facility, (ii) a 5-year $400 million term loan A facility and (iii) a 7.5-year $600 million term loan B
facility. The initial draw under these facilities occurred on January 10, 2005 (the “Funding Date”). Proceeds from
the facilities were used to refinance the credit facilities existing as of December 31, 2004 (with the exception of the
term loan E issued with the original principal amount of $300 million in November 2004, under the then-existing
credit agreement), and pay fees and expenses related to the refinancing.

The amended and restated credit agreement also provided for the borrowing of up to $300 million in
incremental extensions of credit. On November 18, 2005, we completed the borrowing under the credit facility of an
additional $300 million through a term loan B-2. Proceeds from this borrowing were used for general corporate
purposes. The terms of the term loan B-2 are substantially similar to the terms of the term loan B.

Borrowings under the credit facilities described above (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) bear interest at a
rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of
(1) the administrative agent’s prime rate and (2) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1% or (b) a LIBOR or a
eurocurrency rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for deposits in the currency of such borrowing for
the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs. As of December 31, 2006, the
applicable margin for the term loan A and the revolving credit facility was 0.375% with respect to base rate
borrowings and 1.375% with respect to eurocurrency borrowings, and the applicable margin for the term loan B,
term loan B-2, and the term loan E was 0.50% with respect to base rate borrowings and 1.50% with respect to
eurocurrency borrowings. The commitment fee on the undrawn amounts under the revolving credit facility was
0.35%. The commitment fee on the revolving credit facility and the applicable margin on the Senior Secured Credit

29


-----

Facilities are subject to a leverage-based grid. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $830 million was available
under the revolving credit facility after giving effect to $70 million in outstanding letters of credit and guarantees
which reduced the amount available.

The term loan Awill amortize in equal quarterly amounts, totaling $60 million in 2007, $160 million in 2008,
and $135 million in 2009 with one final installment of $45 million on January 10, 2010, the maturity date. The term
loan B in the original amount of $600 million will amortize in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to
1% per annum during the first seven years and three months of its term and in one final installment on June 30, 2012,
the maturity date. The term loan B-2 in the original amount of $300 million will amortize in equal quarterly
installments in an amount equal to 1% per annum during the first six years and three months of its term and in one
final installment on its maturity date, June 30, 2012. The Term loan E in the original amount of $300 million
matures on October 31, 2010, and will amortize in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 1% per annum
during the first five years and nine months of its term and one final installment on the maturity date.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings, TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings Inc. and substantially all of our existing and subsequently acquired domestic subsidiaries (other
than the Company’s receivables subsidiaries). Obligations of the foreign subsidiary borrowers are unconditionally
guaranteed by TRWAutomotive Holdings Corp., TRWAutomotive Intermediate Holdings Corp., us and certain of
our foreign subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured by a perfected first priority security
interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets of and that of substantially all of
our domestic subsidiaries, including a pledge of 100% of our stock and substantially all of our domestic
subsidiaries, and 65% of the stock of foreign subsidiaries owned by domestic entities. In addition, foreign
borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured by assets of the foreign borrowers.

We intend to refinance this credit facility shortly after the conclusion of this offering.

**_Debt Covenants_**

The Senior Notes, Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of
covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to sell
assets, incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock, repay other indebtedness (including the Senior Notes
and Senior Subordinated Notes), pay certain dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock, create liens on
assets, make investments, loans or advances, make certain acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations, enter
into sale and leaseback transactions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, amend certain material
agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes and the
receivables facility, and change the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries. In addition, the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities contain financial covenants relating to: a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest
coverage ratio and require certain prepayments from excess cash flows, as defined and in connection with certain
asset sales and the incurrence of debt not permitted under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. As of December 31,
2006, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants.

**_Receivables Facility_**

We have entered into a receivables facility, which, as amended, extends to December 2009 and as of
December 31, 2006 provided up to $250 million in funding from commercial paper conduits sponsored by
commercial lenders, based on availability of eligible receivables and other customary factors. On January 19, 2007,
we reduced the committed amount of the facility to $209 million and amended certain terms of the receivables
facility to increase the availability of funding under the facility. The reductions to the committed amount of the
facility lower future fees on the unused portion. Certain of our subsidiaries (the “sellers”) sell trade accounts
receivables (the “receivables”) originated by them in the United States through the receivables facility. Receivables
are sold to TRW Automotive Receivables LLC (the “transferor”) at a discount. The transferor is a bankruptcyremote special purpose limited liability company that is our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary. The transferor’s
purchase of receivables is financed through a transfer agreement with TRW Automotive Global Receivables LLC
(the “borrower”). Under the terms of the transfer agreement, the borrower purchases all receivables sold to the
transferor. The borrower is a bankruptcy-remote qualifying special purpose limited liability company that is wholly
owned by the transferor and is not consolidated when certain requirements are met as further described below.

30


-----

Generally, multi-seller commercial paper conduits supported by committed liquidity facilities are available to
provide cash funding for the borrowers’ purchase of receivables through secured loans/tranches to the extent desired
and permitted under the receivables loan agreement. The borrower issues a note to the transferor for the difference
between the purchase price for the receivables purchased and cash borrowed through the facility. The sellers of the
receivables act as servicing agents per the servicing agreement and continue to service the transferred receivables
for which they receive a monthly servicing fee at a rate of 1% per annum of the average daily outstanding balance of
receivables. The usage fee under the facility is 0.85% of outstanding borrowings. In addition, we are required to pay
a fee of 0.40% on the unused portion of the receivables facility. Both the usage fee and the fee on the unused portion
of the facility are subject to a leveraged based grid. These rates are per annum and payments of these fees are made
to the lenders on the monthly settlement date.

Availability of funding under the receivables facility depends primarily upon the outstanding trade accounts
receivable balance, and is determined by reducing the receivables balance by outstanding borrowings under the
program, the historical rate of collection on those receivables and other characteristics of those receivables that
affect their eligibility (such as bankruptcy or downgrading below investment grade of the obligor, delinquency and
excessive concentration). Due to decreased availability under the facility as a result of certain customer credit rating
downgrades below investment grade, we reduced the committed amount of the facility from $400 million to
$250 million on January 24, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, based on the terms of this facility and the criteria
described above, approximately $191 million of our total reported accounts receivable balance was considered
eligible for borrowings under this facility, of which approximately $104 million would have been available for
funding. We had no borrowings under this facility as of December 31, 2006 or December 31, 2005.

In addition to the receivables facility described above, certain of our European subsidiaries have entered into
receivables financing arrangements. We have up to A75 million available until January 2008 through an arrangement involving a wholly-owned special purpose vehicle, which purchases trade receivables from its German
affiliates and sells those trade receivables to a German bank. Additionally, we have a receivables financing
arrangement of up to £25 million available until November 2007 through an arrangement involving a wholly-owned
special purpose vehicle, which purchases trade receivables from its United Kingdom affiliates and sells those trade
receivables to a United Kingdom bank. In May 2006, we terminated a factoring arrangement in France which had up
to A78 million available until November 2006 in which customers sent bills of exchange directly to the bank. In July
2006, we replaced that factoring arrangement with a new arrangement which provides for availability of up to
A80 million until July 2007. This new arrangement involves a wholly-owned special purpose vehicle, which
purchases trade receivables from its French affiliates and sells those trade receivables to a French bank. All
European arrangements are renewable for one year at the end of their respective terms, if not terminated. As of
December 31, 2006, approximately A140 million and £11 million was available for funding under our European
accounts receivable facilities. There were no outstanding borrowings under any of these facilities as of December 31, 2006 or December 31, 2005.

**_Other Borrowings_**

In January 2004, we entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of
$500 million to effectively change a fixed rate debt obligation into a floating rate obligation. The total notional
amount of these agreements was equal to the face value of the designated debt instrument. The swap agreements
were expected to settle in February 2013, the maturity date of the corresponding debt instrument. Since these
interest rate swaps hedged the designated debt balance and qualified for fair value hedge accounting, changes in the
fair value of the swaps also resulted in a corresponding adjustment to the value of the debt. As of December 31,
2006, we recorded an obligation of $15 million related to these interest rate swaps resulting from an increase in
forward rates, along with a corresponding reduction in debt. In anticipation of this offering, in late February 2007
we unwound these swap agreements.

We have borrowings under uncommitted credit agreements in many of the countries in which we operate.
These borrowings are primarily in the local currency of the country or region where our operations are located. The
borrowings are from various domestic and international banks at quoted market interest rates.

New York (which initially shall be the principal corporate trust office of the trustee, at 101 Barclay Street, New York,
New York 10286).

The notes will be issued only in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $100,000 and any
integral multiple of $100,000 in the case of the dollar notes and in denominations of A50,000 and any integral
multiple of A50,000 in the case of the euro notes. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange of notes, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other
similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

**Terms of the Notes**

The 2014 notes will be unsecured senior obligations of the Company and will mature on, 2014. The
euro notes will be unsecured senior obligations of the Company and will mature on, 2014. The 2017
notes will be unsecured senior obligations of the Company and will mature on, 2017. Each series of notes
will bear interest at the applicable rate per annum shown on the front cover of this offering memorandum from
, 2007 or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for, payable semiannually
to holders of record at the close of business on the or immediately preceding the interest
payment date on and of each year, commencing, 2007.

-----

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the notes will not be redeemable at the option of the Company prior to their Stated
Maturity.

The Company may at any time redeem each series of notes, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice mailed by first-class mail to each holder’s registered address, at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid
interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date).

In addition, with respect to each series of notes, at any time and from time to time prior to, 2010, the
Company may redeem in the aggregate up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of such series of notes
(calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional notes of such series) with the net cash proceeds of one or
more Equity Offerings (1) by the Company or (2) by TRWAutomotive Holdings or TRWAutomotive Intermediate
Holdings, in each case, to the extent the net cash proceeds thereof are contributed to the Company or used to
purchase Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company from it, at a redemption price (expressed as
a percentage of principal amount thereof) of % in the case of the 2014 notes, % in the case of the 2017 notes
and % in the case of the euro notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of
holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided,
however, that at least 65% of the original aggregate principal amount of such series of notes (calculated after giving
effect to any issuance of additional notes of such series) must remain outstanding after each such redemption and
provided further that such redemption shall occur within 90 days after the date on which any such Equity Offering is
consummated upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice mailed to each holder of notes being redeemed
and otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the applicable indenture.

Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the redemption thereof, and any such
redemption or notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including,
but not limited to, completion of the related Equity Offering.

**Selection**

In the case of any partial redemption of a series of notes, selection of the notes of such series for redemption
will be made by the applicable trustee in accordance with a written direction from the Company in compliance with
the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which such notes are listed, or if such notes
are not so listed, on a pro rata basis; provided that no dollar notes of $100,000 or less, or euro notes of A50,000 or
less, shall be redeemed in part. If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to such
note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new note in principal amount equal to
the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
note. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on notes or portions thereof called for
redemption so long as the Company has deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of,
plus accrued and unpaid interest on, the notes to be redeemed.

**Ranking**

The indebtedness evidenced by each series of notes will be unsecured Senior Indebtedness of the Company,
will rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Company and will be
senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company. Each series of notes
will also be effectively subordinated to any Secured Indebtedness of the Company to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such Secured Indebtedness.

33


-----

The indebtedness evidenced by the Guarantees will be unsecured Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors, will
rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors and will be
senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Guarantors. The Guarantees
will also be effectively subordinated to any Secured Indebtedness of the Guarantors to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such Secured Indebtedness.

The operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Except for Subsidiaries that are
Guarantors, claims of creditors of the Company’s Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred
stockholders (if any) of the Company’s Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of the Company’s Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company, including holders of the notes.
The notes, therefore, will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred
stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company that are not Guarantors.

As of December 31, 2006, assuming the Issuer had completed this offering and applied the proceeds therefrom
as set forth under “Use of Proceeds” and that 100% of the Existing Notes were validly tendered and accepted for
purchase in the tender offers, the Issuer would have had approximately $1,582 million of senior secured
indebtedness (all of which is indebtedness under its senior credit facilities and which does not include availability
of approximately $830 million under the revolving credit facility).

The indentures will not limit the amount of Indebtedness that the Company and its Subsidiaries may incur in
the future, although the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to Incur Secured Indebtedness will be subject to
certain limitations as described under “— Certain Covenants — Liens.”

**Guarantees**

Each of the Company’s direct and indirect Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries (other than Receivables
Subsidiaries and Captive Insurance Subsidiaries) on the Issue Date and TRWAutomotive Luxembourg will jointly and
severally irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee each series of notes on an unsecured senior basis. In the future,
TRWAutomotive Holdings, TRWAutomotive Intermediate Holdings and certain additional Domestic Subsidiaries of
the Company may be required to become Guarantors of the notes under the circumstances described under “— Certain
Covenants — Future guarantors.” Each Guarantee will be limited in amount to an amount not to exceed the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Guarantor without rendering the Guarantee, as it relates to such
Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “Risk Factors — Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a
court to void the notes and the guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.”

Each indenture will provide that the Guarantee of a Guarantor will be a continuing guarantee and shall:

(1) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Obligations guaranteed by such
Guarantee;

(2) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, be binding upon the Guarantor and its successors; and

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the applicable trustee, the holders of the notes guaranteed
by such Guarantee and their successors, transferees and assigns.

Each indenture will provide that the Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically released and discharged:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition (including through merger or consolidation) of the
Capital Stock, or all or substantially all the assets, of such Guarantor to a Person or a group of Persons that is
not (either before or after giving effect to such sale or other disposition) the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or

(2) upon Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance as described below under the caption
“— Defeasance;” or

(3) in the case of any Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary of the Company, if such Guarantor does not
guarantee any Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement or have outstanding or guarantee any other Indebtedness in excess of a De Minimis Guaranteed Amount; or

34


-----

(4) in the case of any Significant Domestic Subsidiary of the Company that is not a Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary, if such Guarantor ceases to be a Significant Subsidiary of the Company or ceases to guarantee any
Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement; or

(5) in the case of TRWAutomotive Luxembourg, if such Guarantor ceases to guarantee any Indebtedness
under the Credit Agreement.

A Guarantee also will be automatically released upon the applicable Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary as a
result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing Bank Indebtedness or other exercise of remedies
in respect thereof. In the event that the Guarantee of TRWAutomotive Luxembourg is released with respect to any
series of notes and TRWAutomotive Luxembourg thereafter guarantees Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement,
TRWAutomotive Luxembourg will again provide a Guarantee with respect to such notes. Wholly Owned Domestic
Subsidiaries of the Company and Significant Domestic Subsidiaries of the Company whose Guarantees are released
with respect to a series of notes may also be required to provide a Guarantee with respect to such notes following
such release in the circumstances described under “— Certain Covenants — Future guarantors.”

**Change of Control Triggering Event**

Each indenture will provide that, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to
the series of notes issued thereunder, each holder of such notes will have the right to require the Company to
repurchase all or any part of such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), except to the extent the
Company has previously elected to redeem such notes as described under “— Optional Redemption.”

In the event that at the time of such Change of Control Triggering Event the terms of the Bank Indebtedness
restrict or prohibit the repurchase of notes pursuant to this covenant, then prior to the mailing of the notice to holders
provided for in the immediately following paragraph but in any event within 30 days following any Change of
Control Triggering Event, the Company shall:

(1) repay in full all Bank Indebtedness; or

(2) obtain the requisite consent, if required, under the agreements governing the Bank Indebtedness to
permit the repurchase of the notes as provided for in the immediately following paragraph.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, except to the extent that the Company has
exercised its right to redeem the applicable notes as described under “— Optional Redemption,” the Company shall
mail a notice (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each holder of such notes with a copy to the applicable trustee stating:

(1) that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and that such holder has the right to require
the Company to purchase such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on a
record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date);

(2) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding such Change of Control
Triggering Event;

(3) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is mailed); and

(4) the instructions determined by the Company, consistent with this covenant, that a holder must follow
in order to have such notes purchased.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering
Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the applicable indenture that apply to a Change of Control Offer made by the
Company and purchases all notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. A
Change of Control Offer may be made with respect to any series of notes in advance of a Change of Control

35


-----

Triggering Event, and conditional upon the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive
agreement for the Change of Control is in place at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to this covenant.
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under this paragraph by virtue thereof.

The Change of Control Triggering Event repurchase provision described above is a result of negotiations
between the Company and the initial purchasers. The Company has no present intention to engage in a transaction
involving a Change of Control Triggering Event, although it is possible that the Company could decide to do so in
the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of
Control Triggering Event under an indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such
time or otherwise affect the Company’s capital structure or credit ratings. See “Risk Factors — Ratings for the notes
may not reflect all risks of an investment in the notes.”

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event would constitute a
default under the Credit Agreement. Future Senior Indebtedness of the Company may contain prohibitions on
certain events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Senior Indebtedness to
be repurchased upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to
require the Company to repurchase notes could cause a default under such Senior Indebtedness, even if the Change
of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. Finally,
the Company’s ability to pay cash to the holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Company’s then existing
financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any
required repurchases.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of “all or
substantially all” the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a developing
body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require the Company to repurchase such notes
as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. See “Risk Factors — In certain circumstances, you should not
rely on the “change of control” provision contained in the indentures governing the notes to protect you from the
Company engaging in transactions to sell our business.”

**Certain Covenants**

Each indenture will provide that during any period of time that (i) the notes issued under such indenture have
Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under such
indenture, the Company will not be subject to the covenant described under “Change of Control Triggering Event”
(the “Suspended Covenant”) with respect to such notes. In the event that the Company is not subject to the
Suspended Covenant with respect to a series of notes for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any
subsequent date one or both of the Rating Agencies (a) withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the
rating assigned to such notes below an Investment Grade Rating and/or (b) the Company or any of its Affiliates enter
into an agreement to effect a transaction that would result in a Change of Control and one or more of the Rating
Agencies indicate that if consummated, such transaction (alone or together with any related recapitalization or
refinancing transactions) would cause such Rating Agency to withdraw its Investment Grade Rating or downgrade
the ratings assigned to such notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Company will thereafter again be
subject to the Suspended Covenant under the applicable indenture with respect to future events, including, without
limitation, a proposed transaction described in clause (b) above.

There can be no assurance that the notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

**Liens.** Each indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien on any asset or property of the Company or such
Subsidiary, or any income or profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, that

36


-----

secures any obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries unless the notes or Guarantees, as applicable,
issued under such indenture are equally and ratably secured with (or on a senior basis to, in the case of obligations
subordinated in right of payment to the notes or Guarantees, as applicable, issued under such indenture) the
obligations so secured or until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien. The preceding
sentence will not require the Company or any Subsidiary to secure any series of notes or Guarantees if the Lien
consists of a Permitted Lien.

**Sale/Leaseback Transactions.** Each indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into any Sale/Leaseback Transaction involving a Principal Property unless:

(1) the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, could have incurred a Lien to secure such Indebtedness pursuant to the covenant described above under the caption “— Liens”; or

(2) the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, receives proceeds from such Sale/Leaseback
Transaction that are at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the property that is the subject such Sale/
Leaseback Transaction as determined in good faith by the Company (which determination shall be evidenced
by (1) an Officer’s Certificate in the event of a transfer of assets with a Fair Market Value in excess of
$50 million and (2) a resolution approved in good faith by at least a majority of the Board of Directors of the
Company in the event of a transfer of assets with Fair Market Value in excess of $100 million).

**Reports and other information.** Each indenture will provide that TRWAutomotive Holdings shall deliver
to the applicable trustee, within 15 days after it would have been required to file with the SEC, copies of its annual
reports and the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the
SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) which it is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act. In the event that TRWAutomotive Holdings is at any time no longer subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, either it or the Company shall provide the applicable
trustee with copies of annual reports and such information, documents and other reports as TRW Automotive
Holdings or the Company, as the case may be, would be required to file with the SEC were it subject to such
reporting requirements. In such event, such reports shall be provided within 45 days of the times as TRW
Automotive Holdings or the Company, as the case may be, would be required to provide such reports were it subject
to such reporting requirements.

If at any time any direct or indirect parent of TRWAutomotive Holdings is a Guarantor of any series of notes,
the Company will be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of the covenant described under this caption
with respect to such series of notes if such direct or indirect parent delivers to the applicable trustee within the time
periods specified in the preceding paragraph copies of its annual reports and the information, documents and other
reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) which
such direct or indirect parent is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or
which such direct or indirect parent would be required to file with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act.

Each indenture will provide that the Company will be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of the
covenant described under this caption with respect to such series of notes if TRW Automotive Holdings, or in the
event that TRWAutomotive Holdings is at any time no longer subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, either TRWAutomotive Holdings or the Company, or if at any time any direct or indirect
parent of TRWAutomotive Holdings is a Guarantor of such series of notes, such direct or indirect parent of TRW
Automotive Holdings, shall have filed such annual reports and the information, documents and other reports with
the SEC using its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System or any successor system. The
subsequent filing with the applicable trustee and, if applicable, the SEC of any report required by this covenant will
be deemed to automatically cure any Default or Event of Default resulting from the failure to file such report within
the time period required.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company will not be deemed to have failed to comply
with any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (5) under “Defaults” until 120 days after the date any
report hereunder is due.

37


-----

**Future guarantors.** Each indenture will provide that (a) if after the Issue Date any Wholly Owned Domestic
Subsidiary of the Company (other than a Receivables Subsidiary and a Captive Insurance Subsidiary) guarantees
any Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement or has outstanding or guarantees any other Indebtedness in excess of a
De Minimis Guaranteed Amount or (b) if after the Issue Date any Significant Domestic Subsidiary of the Company
that is not a Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary guarantees any Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, then
such Subsidiary shall, if not already a Guarantor, execute and deliver to the applicable trustee a supplemental
indenture pursuant to which such Subsidiary will guarantee the payment of the notes issued under the indenture. In
addition, each indenture will provide that if after the Issue Date TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive
Intermediate Holdings becomes engaged in any business in any material respect other than incidental to its
ownership, directly or indirectly, of Capital Stock of the Company or TRWAutomotive Intermediate Holdings, as
applicable, or acquires any assets that are material, other than Capital Stock of the Company or TRW Automotive
Intermediate Holdings, as applicable, then TRWAutomotive Holdings or TRWAutomotive Intermediate Holdings,
as applicable, will execute and deliver to the applicable trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which TRW
Automotive Holdings or TRWAutomotive Intermediate Holdings, as applicable, will guarantee the payment of the
notes issued under the indenture.

Each Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by that
Subsidiary without rendering the Guarantee, as it relates to such Subsidiary, voidable under applicable law relating
to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.

**Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets**

Each indenture will provide that the Company may not consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into
(whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) the Company is the surviving corporation or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or
other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company organized or
existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof
or a member state of the European Union (the Company or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called
the “Successor Company”);

(2) the Successor Company (if other than the Company) expressly assumes all the obligations of the
Company under the indenture and the applicable series of notes pursuant to a supplemental indenture or other
documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the applicable trustee;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing under the indenture;

(4) each Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, shall have by
supplemental indentures confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s obligations under the
indenture and the applicable series of notes; and

(5) the Company shall have delivered to the applicable trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any)
comply with the indenture.

Upon the occurrence of any transaction or series of transactions that are of the type described in, and effected in
accordance with, the foregoing paragraph, the Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, the
Company under the indenture and the applicable series of notes with the same effect as if the Successor Company
had been named as the Company in the Indenture. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, (a) any
Subsidiary may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Company or to
another Subsidiary and (b) the Company may merge with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of
reincorporating the Company in another state of the United States.

38


-----

Each indenture will further provide that, subject to certain limitations in the indenture governing the release of
a Guarantee of a Guarantor, each Guarantor will not, and the Company will not permit such a Guarantor to,
consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation), or
sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or
more related transactions to, any Person (other than the Company or another Guarantor) unless:

(1) such Guarantor is the surviving corporation or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company
organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any
territory thereof or a member state of the European Union (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be,
being herein called the “Successor Guarantor”);

(2) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor) expressly assumes all the obligations of such
Guarantor under the indenture and such Guarantors’ Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture or other
documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the applicable trustee;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing under the indenture; and

(4) the Company shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to the applicable trustee an Officers’
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the indenture.

Upon the occurrence of any transaction or series of transactions that are of the type described in, and effected in
accordance with, the foregoing paragraph, a Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, the
predecessor Guarantor under the indenture and the predecessor Guarantor’s Guarantee with the same effect as if the
Successor Guarantor had been named as the Guarantor in the Indenture. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the foregoing, a Guarantor may merge with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of reincorporating such
Guarantor in another state of the United States.

**Defaults**

Each indenture will provide that the following events shall constitute Events of Default with respect to the
series of notes issued thereunder:

(1) a default in any payment of interest on such notes when due continued for 30 days,

(2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of such notes when due at its Stated Maturity,
upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise,

(3) the failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under the covenant described under
“— Merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets” above,

(4) the failure by the Company to comply for 30 days after written notice with any of its obligations under
the covenants described under “— Change of Control Triggering Event,”

(5) the failure by the Company to comply for 60 days after written notice with any other agreement
contained in the indenture or such notes (other than a default relating to the Company’s obligations described
under “— Certain covenants — Reports and other information,” with respect to which the applicable period
shall be 120 days after receipt of written notice),

(6) the failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company to pay any Indebtedness
(other than Indebtedness owing to the Company or a Subsidiary) within any applicable grace period after final
maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default if the total
amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $75.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent
(the “cross acceleration provision”),

39


-----

(7) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary of the Company (the “bankruptcy provisions”), or

(8) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary of the Company ceases to be in full force and effect with
respect to such notes (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms its
obligations under the indenture or its Guarantee of such notes and such Default continues for 10 days.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether
it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any
court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. However, a default under
clause (4) or (5) above will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to a series of notes until the applicable
trustee or the holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes of such series notify the Company of the
default and the Company does not cure such default within the time specified in such clause after receipt of such
notice.

If an Event of Default (other than a Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company) occurs and is continuing with respect to a series of notes, the applicable trustee or the
holders of at least 25% in principal amount of outstanding notes of such series by notice to the Company may
declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the notes of such series to be due and
payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of
Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs, the principal
of, premium, if any, and interest on all the notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration
or other act on the part of the applicable trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of a series may rescind any such acceleration with respect to
such notes and its consequences.

In the case of an Event of Default specified in clause (6) above, such Event of Default and all consequences
thereof (excluding, however, any resulting payment default) will be annulled, waived and rescinded with respect to
each series of notes, automatically and without any action by the applicable trustee or the holders of such notes, if
within 60 days after such Event of Default first arose the Company delivers an Officers’ Certificate to the applicable
trustee stating that (i) the Indebtedness that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged, (ii) the
holders of the Indebtedness that is the basis for such Event of Default have rescinded or waived the acceleration,
notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (iii) the default that is the basis for such
Event of Default has been cured; provided, however, that a prior acceleration of the principal amount of a series of
notes shall not be annulled, waived or rescinded upon the occurrence of any event described in clause (i), (ii) or
(iii) of this paragraph.

Subject to the provisions of the indentures relating to the duties of the trustee, in case an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing under an indenture, the applicable trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers under the indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered
to the applicable trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the
right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with
respect to any series of notes or the indenture pursuant to which such notes were issued unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the applicable trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing,

(2) holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes of such series have requested the
applicable trustee to pursue the remedy,

(3) such holders have offered the applicable trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss,
liability or expense,

(4) the applicable trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the
request and the offer of security or indemnity, and

(5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of such series have not given the
applicable trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

40


-----

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of a series
will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
applicable trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on such trustee. The trustee, however, will be permitted
to refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the applicable indenture or that the trustee determines is
unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the trustee in personal liability. Prior to
taking any action under an indenture, the applicable trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its
sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

Each indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the applicable
trustee, such trustee must mail to each holder of notes issued under the indenture notice of the Default within the
earlier of 90 days after it occurs or 30 days after it is actually known to a Trust Officer or written notice of it is
received by such trustee. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest
on any series of notes, the applicable trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers
in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the holders of such notes. In addition, the
Company will be required under each indenture to deliver to the applicable trustee, within 120 days after the end of
each fiscal year, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred with respect
to the applicable series of notes during the previous year. The Company will also be required under each indenture
to deliver to the applicable trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event which
would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect
thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, each indenture may be amended with the consent of the holders of a majority in
principal amount of the outstanding notes issued thereunder and any past default or compliance with any provisions
may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes issued
thereunder. However, with respect to each series of notes, without the consent of each holder affected, no
amendment may be made that among other things:

(1) reduces the amount of such notes whose holders must consent to an amendment,

(2) reduces the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on such notes,

(3) reduces the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of such notes,

(4) reduces the premium payable upon the redemption of such notes or change the time at which such
notes may be redeemed as described under “Optional Redemption” above,

(5) makes such notes payable in money other than that stated in such notes,

(6) impairs the right of any holder to receive payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
such notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with
respect to such notes,

(7) make any change in the amendment provisions which require each holder’s consent or in the waiver
provisions, or

(8) modify the Guarantees in any manner adverse to the holders.

Each indenture will provide that, without the consent of any holder, the Company and the applicable trustee
may amend the indenture to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, to provide for the assumption by
a successor corporation, partnership or limited liability company of the obligations of the Company under the
indenture, to provide for the issuance under the indenture of uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of
certificated notes (provided that the uncertificated notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f)
of the Code or in a manner such that the uncertificated notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code), to
add Guarantees with respect to the notes issued under the indenture, to secure the notes issued under the indenture,
to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the holders or to surrender any right or power conferred

41


-----

upon the Company, to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder or to make certain
changes to the indenture to provide for the issuance of additional notes.

The consent of the noteholders under an indenture will not be necessary to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment to the indenture. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment. After an amendment under an indenture becomes effective, the Company will be required to mail to the
holders of notes issued under the indenture a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to give
such notice to all noteholders entitled to receive such notice, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the
validity of the amendment.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A noteholder will be permitted to transfer or exchange notes in accordance with the indenture under which
such notes were issued. Upon any transfer or exchange, the registrar and the applicable trustee may require a
noteholder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Company may
require a noteholder to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the applicable indenture. The Company will
not be required to transfer or exchange any note of a series selected for redemption or to transfer or exchange any
note of such series for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of the notes of such series to be redeemed. Each series
of notes will be issued in registered form and the registered holder of a note of such series will be treated as the
owner of such note for all purposes.

**Defeasance**

With respect to each series of notes, the Company may at its option and at any time elect to have all its
obligations discharged under the applicable indenture and such series of notes (“legal defeasance”), except for
certain notes of such series, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes of such series and to maintain a
registrar and paying agent in respect of notes of such series. In addition, with respect to each series of notes, the
Company may at its option and at any time elect to have all its obligations terminated under the covenants described
under “Certain covenants,” the operation of the cross acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions with respect
to Subsidiaries and the limitations described under “Merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets”
(“covenant defeasance”). If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option
with respect to a series of notes, each Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its
Guarantee of such series.

The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option with respect to a series of notes notwithstanding its
prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option with respect to such series. If the Company exercises its legal
defeasance option with respect to a series of notes, payment of such notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to a
series of notes, payment of such notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3),
(4), (6), (7) with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries, or (8) under “— Defaults” above or because of the failure
of the Company to comply with “— Merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option with respect to a series of notes, the Company must irrevocably
deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”) with the applicable trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the
payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on such notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and
must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the applicable trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to
the effect that holders of such notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a
result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in
the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue
Service or change in applicable Federal income tax law).

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Bank of New York will be appointed to serve as the trustee under each indenture and will be appointed to
act as the Registrar and Paying Agent with respect to each series of notes.

**BOOK-ENTRY SETTLEMENT AND CLEARANCE**

**General**

Each issue of notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act will
be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Rule 144A
Global Notes”). The Rule 144A Global Notes representing the dollar notes (the “Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes”)
will be deposited with the trustee under the applicable indenture, as custodian for The Depository Trust Company
(“DTC”), and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. The Rule 144A Global Notes representing
the euro notes (the “Euro Rule 144A Global Notes”) will be deposited with, or on behalf of, the common depositary
(the “Common Depositary”) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the
nominee of the Common Depositary.

Each issue of notes sold to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will be
represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Regulation S
Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes
representing the dollar notes (the “Dollar Regulation S Global Notes”) will be registered in the name of Cede & Co.,
as nominee of DTC and deposited with the applicable trustee as custodian for DTC for credit to Euroclear and
Clearstream and the Regulation S Global Notes representing the euro notes (the “Euro Regulation S Global Notes”)
will be deposited with, or on behalf of, the Common Depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the
Common Depositary.

The euro notes will not be eligible for clearance through DTC.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (“Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and in the
Regulations S Global Notes (the “Unrestricted Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Restricted BookEntry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through such participants. Prior to the 40th day after the later of
the commencement of this offering and the date the notes were originally issued (the “Distribution Compliance
Period”), interests in the Regulation S Global Notes may only be held through Euroclear or Clearstream. Euroclear
and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through
customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under
the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes will not be entitled to
receive physical delivery of certificated notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery
of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge
Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be
considered the owners or “holders” of notes for any purpose.

So long as the notes are held in global form, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or their
respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the indentures. In
addition, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and indirect participants
must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own BookEntry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the indentures.

Neither we nor the trustees under the indentures will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the
records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable (or their respective nominees), will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price
payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by

53


-----

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any
portion thereof). We understand that, under existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all
of the notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective
participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other
basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of A50,000 or $100,000, as
applicable, principal amount or less may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) to DTC or its nominee (in the case of the Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes and the
Dollar Regulation S Global Notes) and to the Common Depositary or its nominee (in the case of the Euro Rule 144A
Global Notes and the Euro Regulation S Global Notes), which will distribute such payments to participants in
accordance with their procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or
withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of
whatever nature except as may be required by law. We expect that standing customer instructions and customary
practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the indentures, the Issuer and the trustees under the indentures will treat the registered
holder of the Global Notes (DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for
the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we nor the trustees nor any of
our or the trustees’ respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspect of the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to
payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records
of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to payments made on
account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

   - DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

**Currency of payment for the Global Notes**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between DTC and any holder, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest
on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes will be paid to holders of
interests in such notes through DTC in dollars. Except as may be otherwise agreed between Euroclear and/or
Clearstream and any holder, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in
respect of, the Euro Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests
in such notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream (i) in euros in the case of the Euro Rule 144A Global Notes and
the Euro Regulation S Global Notes and (ii) in dollars in the case of the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes. Payments
will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the applicable
securities clearing system) applicable thereto. None of we, the trustees, the initial purchasers or any of our or their
respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses
or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any
such payment.

**Action by owners of book-entry interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or
more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of
such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given
such direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers
or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the
notes, each of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive
registered notes in certificated form (“Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute definitive registered notes to
its participants.

54


-----

**Transfers**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants, which rules and procedures may
change from time to time.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors”. Book-Entry Interests in the Global
Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed in “Notice to Investors”.

Book-Entry Interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes and only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the relevant indenture) to the effect that such transfer is made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act. During the Distribution Compliance Period, any sale or transfer of
ownership of an Unrestricted Book-Entry Interest to a U.S. person will not be permitted unless such resale or
transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under
“Notice to Investors”. Accordingly, an Unrestricted Book-Entry Interest may be transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Restricted Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the relevant indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a
person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A
in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions
described under “Notice to Investors”, and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the
United States or any other jurisdiction. After the Distribution Compliance Period, such certification requirements
will no longer apply to such transfers.

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on the face of the
Rule 144A Global Notes, as set forth in “Notice to Investors”.

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of any
Unrestricted Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided
in the relevant indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A
(if available under the Securities Act).

Transfers involving an exchange of an Unrestricted Book-Entry Interest for a Restricted Book-Entry Interest or
vice versa are expected to be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the trustee under the
applicable indenture through the DTC Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian (DWAC) system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of
the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the corresponding
Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of
Unrestricted Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes prior to the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry
Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and
accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to BookEntry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the indentures, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes:

   - in the case of a dollar Global Note, DTC notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
depositary for the dollar Global Note, or DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange
Act and, in either case a qualified successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

   - in the case of a euro Global Note, Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to
continue as clearing agency, or the Common Depositary notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to
continue as the common depositary, and a successor clearing agency and common depositary are not
appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

55


-----

   - if DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under any of the indentures; or

   - if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either DTC,
Euroclear or the Issuer following an event of default under any of the indentures.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such note by surrendering it to the registrar or a transfer agent. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial
redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive
Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered
Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the
holder, as applicable; provided, that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than A50,000 or $100,000,
as applicable, will be issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivery of the
Definitive Registered Notes.

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period
of 15 calendar days preceding (a) the record date for any payment of interest on the notes, (b) any date fixed for
redemption of the notes or (c) the date fixed for selection of the notes to be redeemed in part. Also, the Issuer is not
required to register the transfer or exchange of any notes selected for redemption. In the event of the transfer of any
Definitive Registered Note, the trustee under the applicable indenture may require a holder, among other things, to
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the applicable indenture. The Issuer may
require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the indentures and the notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, the Issuer will issue and the trustee under the
applicable indenture will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Issuer’s and the trustee’s
requirements are met. The trustee under the applicable indenture or the Issuer may require a holder requesting
replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the
trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the trustee or the paying agent appointed pursuant to the relevant
indenture from any loss that may result if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for its
expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of any of
the indentures, the Issuer at its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only
in accordance with the relevant indenture. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Information concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

**DTC.** DTC is:

   - a limited purpose trust company organised under the New York Banking Law;

  - a “banking organization” under New York Banking Law;

   - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

   - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

   - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of securities
participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants include
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organisations. DTC’s
owners are the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. and a number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust

56


-----

companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant also have access to the
DTC system and are known as indirect participants.

Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and
certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not
participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a
definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.
In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC system will receive distributions attributable to the
Rule 144A Global Notes only through DTC participants.

**_Euroclear and Clearstream._** Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating
organisations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective
participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement,
lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic
securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear or
Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

**Global clearance and settlement under the book-entry system**

The euro notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to trade on the Alternative Securities Market of
the Irish Stock Exchange. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to list the euro notes on such
exchange. If we do not list the euro notes on the Alternative Securities Market of the Irish Stock Exchange, we
intend to apply to list the euro notes on another exchange chosen by us in our sole discretion. The dollar notes
represented by the Global Notes are expected trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any
permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in
immediately available funds. We expect that secondary trading in any certificated notes will also be settled in
immediately available funds. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Global Notes,
cross-market transfers between the participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants,
on the other hand, will be done through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of each of Euroclear or
Clearstream by its common depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures
and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream will, if the transaction
meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the Common Depositary to take action to effect final
settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the Global Notes in DTC, and making or receiving
payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear
participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the Common Depositary.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an
interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the
relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business
day for Euroclear and) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear and Clearstream as
a result of a sale of an interest in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in
DTC will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or
Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are expected to follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may
be discontinued at any time. None of we, the trustees, the initial purchasers nor any paying agent will have any
responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, or their respective participants or indirect
participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES**

**To ensure compliance with Internal Revenue Service Circular 230, you are hereby notified that any**
**discussion of tax matters set forth in this offering memorandum was written in connection with the**
**promotion or marketing of the transactions or matters addressed herein and was not intended or written**
**to be used, and cannot be used by any prospective investor, for the purpose of avoiding tax-related penalties**
**under federal, state or local tax law. Each prospective investor should seek advice based on its particular**
**circumstances from an independent tax advisor.**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the ownership of
notes as of the date hereof. Except where noted, this summary deals only with notes that are held as capital assets by
initial purchasers who acquired the notes upon original issuance at their initial offering price and it does not deal
with special situations.

For example, this summary does not address tax consequences to holders who may be subject to special tax
treatment, such as dealers in securities or currencies, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real
estate investment trusts, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, persons holding our notes as a part of a hedging,
integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, traders in securities that elect to use a
mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings, persons liable for alternative minimum tax,
partnerships or other pass-through entities for United States federal income tax purposes, U.S. holders (as defined
below) of our notes whose “functional currency” is not the United States dollar, United States expatriates,
controlled foreign corporations, or passive foreign investment companies.

This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and
regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps
retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized
below.

If a partnership holds our notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding our notes, you should
consult your tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences
to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the effects of any state, local or non-United
States tax laws. If you are considering the purchase of notes, you should consult your own tax advisors
**concerning the particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the ownership of the notes,**
**as well as the consequences to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**Consequences to U.S. holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to you if
you are a U.S. holder of our notes. Certain consequences to “non-U.S. holders” of our notes, which are beneficial
owners of notes (other than partnerships) who are not U.S. holders, are described under “— Consequences to
non-U.S. holders” below.

A “U.S. holder” means a person that is for United States federal income tax purposes one of the following:

   - an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

   - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes)
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

   - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

   - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United
States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in
effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

**_Payments of interest_**

Except as set forth below, stated interest on a note is generally taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is
paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for tax purposes.

**_Sale, exchange and retirement of notes_**

Your tax basis in a note will, in general, be your cost therefor. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a note, you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized
upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid interest,
which will be treated as a payment of interest for federal income tax purposes) and the adjusted tax basis of your
note. Except with respect to gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as described below with respect to
euro notes, such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of individuals derived in respect of capital
assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations.

**_Euro notes_**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences to you of the ownership
of a euro note.

_Payments of interest_

Cash basis U.S. holders are required to include in income the United States dollar value of the amount of
interest received, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in
fact converted into United States dollars. No exchange gain or loss is recognized with respect to the receipt of such
payment.

Accrual basis U.S. holders may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest
payment in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in
income for each taxable year the United States dollar value of the interest that has accrued during such year,
determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such
interest accrued (or, with respect to an interest accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average exchange
rate for the partial period within each taxable year). Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest
income at the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period (or last day of the taxable year in the case of an accrual
period that straddles your taxable year) or on the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five days
of the end of the accrual period. If you make this election, you must apply it consistently to all debt instruments from
year to year and you cannot change it without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). Upon receipt
of an interest payment on such note (including, upon the sale of such note, the receipt of proceeds which include
amounts attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), you will recognize exchange gain or loss in
an amount equal to the difference between the United States dollar value of such payment (determined by
translating any euros received at the spot rate for euros on the date received) and the United States dollar value of the
interest income that you have previously included in income with respect to such payment. In general, exchange
gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss for United States federal income tax purposes.

_Sale, exchange and retirement_

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a euro note, you will recognize gain or loss
equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition (less an
amount equal to any accrued and unpaid interest, which will be treated as a payment of interest for federal income
tax purposes) and your adjusted tax basis in the euro note. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below,
such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of individuals derived with respect to capital assets held
for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.

59


-----

If your euro note is sold, exchanged or retired for an amount denominated in euros, then your amount realized
generally will be based on the spot rate of euros on the date of sale, exchange or retirement. If you are a cash method
taxpayer and the euro notes are traded on an established securities market, the value of euros received is translated
into United States dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the sale. An accrual method taxpayer may elect
the same treatment with respect to the sale of euro notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the
election is applied consistently.

Your tax basis in a euro note generally will be your cost therefor. If you purchase a euro note with euros, your
cost will be the United States dollar value of the euro amount paid for such euro note determined at the time of such
purchase. If you purchase a euro note with previously owned euros, you will recognize ordinary exchange gain or
loss at the time of purchase attributable to the difference at the time of purchase, if any, between your tax basis in
such euros and the fair market value of the euro note in United States dollars on the date of purchase. If you are a
cash method taxpayer and the euro notes are traded on an established securities market, euros paid are translated
into United States dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase. An accrual method taxpayer may
elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase of euro notes traded on an established securities market,
provided that the election is applied consistently.

A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a euro note may be treated as exchange
gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the euro note is your purchase price for the euro note
calculated in euros on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the
difference between (i) the United States dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale,
exchange, retirement or other disposition of the euro note and (ii) the United States dollar value of the principal
amount determined on the date you purchased the euro note. Such gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or
loss and generally will be United States source gain or loss. The realization of such gain or loss will be limited to the
amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of a euro note.

_Exchange gain or loss with respect to euros_

Your tax basis in the euros received as interest on a euro note will be the United States dollar value thereof at the
spot rate in effect on the date the euros are received. Your tax basis in euros received on the sale, exchange or
retirement of a euro note will be equal to the United States dollar value of the euros, determined at the time of the
sale, exchange or retirement, or, if the euro notes are traded on an established securities market, the spot rate of
exchange on the settlement date, in the case of a cash basis U.S. holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. holder as
described above.

Any gain or loss recognized by you on a sale, exchange or other disposition of the euros will be ordinary
income or loss and generally will be United States source gain or loss.

_Reportable Transactions_

Treasury regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions
could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency
transactions. Under the Treasury regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including,
in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or
foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note to the extent that such sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. If you are considering the purchase of a
euro note, you should consult with your own tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect
to an investment in the euro notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction
Disclosure Statement).

**Consequences to non-U.S. holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to you if
you are a non-U.S. holder of our notes.

60


-----

**_United States federal withholding tax_**

The 30% United States federal withholding tax will not apply to any payment of interest on a note, under the
“portfolio interest rule”, provided that:

   - interest paid on the note is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States;

   - you do not actually (or constructively) own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of
our voting stock within the meaning of the Code and applicable United States Treasury regulations;

   - you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us through stock ownership;

   - you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; and

   - either (a) you provide your name and address on an IRS Form W-8BEN (or other applicable form), and
certify, under penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person as defined under the Code or (b) you
hold your notes through certain foreign intermediaries and satisfy the certification requirements of
applicable United States Treasury regulations. Special certification rules apply to certain non-U.S. holders
that are pass-through entities rather than corporations or individuals.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be subject to the
30% United States federal withholding tax, unless you provide us with a properly executed (1) IRS Form W-8BEN
(or other applicable form) claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an
applicable income tax treaty or (2) IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) stating that interest paid on a note
is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the
United States (as discussed below under “United States federal income tax”).

The 30% United States federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any payment of principal or gain that
you realize on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note.

**_United States federal income tax_**

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the notes is effectively connected
with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a
United States permanent establishment), you will be subject to United States federal income tax on that interest on a
net income basis (although exempt from the 30% withholding tax, provided certain certification and disclosure
requirements discussed above in “United States federal withholding tax” are satisfied) in the same manner as if you
were a United States person as defined under the Code. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be
subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of such amount, subject to
adjustments.

Any gain realized on the disposition of a note generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax
unless:

   - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if
required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment), or

   - you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that
disposition, and certain other conditions are met.

**_United States federal estate tax_**

Your estate will not be subject to United States federal estate tax on notes beneficially owned by you at the time
of your death, provided that any payment to you on the notes would be eligible for exemption from the 30% United
States federal withholding tax under the “portfolio interest rule” described above under “— United States federal
withholding tax” without regard to the statement requirement described in the last bullet point.

61


-----

**Information reporting and backup withholding**

**_U.S. holder_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and interest on notes and to
the proceeds of sale of a note paid to U.S. holders other than certain exempt recipients (such as corporations). A
backup withholding tax may apply to such payments if you fail to provide a taxpayer identification number or
certification of other exempt status or fail to report full dividend and interest income.

Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your
United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is furnished to the IRS.

**_Non-U.S. holder_**

Generally, we must report to the IRS and to you the amount of interest on the notes paid to you and the amount
of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest
payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which you reside
under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty.

In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments that we make to you
provided that we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person as defined
under the Code, and we have received from you the statement described above in the last bullet point under
“Consequences to non-U.S. holders — United States federal withholding tax”.

In addition, you will be subject to information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup
withholding with respect to the proceeds of the sale of a note within the United States or conducted through certain
United States-related financial intermediaries, unless the payor receives the statement described above and does not
have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person as defined under the Code, or you
otherwise establish an exemption.

Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your
United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is furnished to the IRS.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the notes by employee
benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the
Code or provisions under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such
provisions of the Code or ERISA (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and entities whose underlying assets are
considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan, account or arrangement (each, a “Plan”).

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is
available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the
ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities
under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by a Plan subject to ERISA or the Code
with respect to which the Issuer, any underwriter or any guarantors is considered to be a party in interest or a
disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of
ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and held in accordance with an
applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. Similar restrictions may apply to Plans
that are subject to Similar Law. Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person
investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of
these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is
particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the notes on behalf of, or with the
assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the
Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and
holding of the notes.

66


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions in the purchase agreement among the Issuer, the guarantors and the initial
purchasers, (i) the Issuer has agreed to sell to Lehman Brothers Inc. (“Lehman”), Banc of America Securities LLC,
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (the
“dollar initial purchasers”), and the dollar initial purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire
principal amount of the dollar notes, and (ii) the Issuer has agreed to sell to Lehman Brothers International (Europe)
(“Lehman Europe”), Banc of America Securities Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Goldman Sachs
International and Merrill Lynch International (the “euro initial purchasers” and, together with the dollar initial
purchasers, the “initial purchasers”), and the euro initial purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the
entire principal amount of the euro notes.

The obligations of the initial purchasers under the purchase agreement, including their agreement to purchase
the notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The purchase agreement provides that the initial purchasers will
purchase all the notes if any of them are purchased.

The respective initial purchasers initially propose to offer the notes for resale at the respective issue price that
appears on the cover of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the respective initial purchasers may
change the offering price and any other selling terms without notice. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes
through certain of their respective affiliates.

In the purchase agreement, the Issuer and the guarantors have agreed that:

   - They will not offer or sell any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries
(other than the notes and in respect of borrowings under the Issuer’s senior credit facilities (as the same may
be amended, modified, supplemented, amended and restated, refinanced or replaced from time to time)) for a
period of 30 days after the date of this offering memorandum without the prior consent of Lehman, in the
case of the dollar notes, or Lehman Europe, in the case of the euro notes.

   - They will indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities
Act, or contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those
liabilities.

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other place. The Issuer
is not required to register to exchange the notes for resale under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction and is not required to offer to exchange the notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction. See “Notice to Investors” for additional information. In the purchase
agreement, each initial purchaser has agreed that:

   - The notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those
registration requirements.

   - During the initial distribution of the notes, it will offer or sell notes only to qualified institutional buyers in
compliance with Rule 144A and outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S.

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about, 2007, which
is the business day following the date of pricing of the notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred to
as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to
settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers
who wish to trade notes prior to the date of delivery hereunder will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes
will initially settle T+, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed
settlement. Purchasers of notes who wish to trade notes prior to the date of delivery hereunder should consult their
own advisor.

In addition, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the
United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of

the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption

In the purchase agreement, in relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area that has

State other than the offers contemplated in the offering memorandum in such Relevant Member State once the
offering memorandum has been approved by the competent authority in such Relevant Member State and published
and passported, if applicable, in accordance with the Prospectus Directive as implemented in such Relevant

**United Kingdom**

This offering memorandum is only being distributed to and is only directed at (a) persons who are outside the

Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, or the Order, or (c) high net worth entities and other persons to
whom it may be lawfully communicated, falling with Article 49(2)(a) to (e) of the Order (all such persons together
being referred to as “relevant persons”). The notes are only available to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to
subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire any notes will be engaged in only with, relevant persons. Any person who
is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this offering memorandum or any of its contents.

For purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer to the public” in relation to any notes in any Relevant
Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the
offer and any notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase any notes, as the same may be
varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant
Member State and the expression “Prospectus Directive” means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant
implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.

Each series of notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. In addition, the
notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Notice to Investors”. We intend to
apply for the euro notes to be admitted to trading on the Alternative Securities Market of the Irish Stock Exchange.
However, the Issuer cannot assure you that it will be able to list the euro notes on such exchange. If the Issuer does
not list the euro notes on the Alternative Securities Market of the Irish Stock Exchange, it intends to apply to list the
euro notes on another exchange chosen by it in its sole discretion. Dollar notes that are sold to qualified institutional
buyers will be eligible for trading in the PORTAL market. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to
make a market in the notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The initial purchasers may discontinue any marketmaking in the notes at any time in their sole discretion. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading
market will develop for the notes, that you will be able to sell your notes at a particular time or that the prices that
you receive when you sell will be favorable.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and
other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

In connection with the offering of the notes, Lehman, on behalf of the dollar purchasers, and Lehman Europe,
on behalf of the euro purchasers, may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering
transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial
purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the notes in the open market for the purpose of
pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the notes
in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing
transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the prices of the notes to be higher than it would
otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the initial purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering
transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

Certain of the initial purchasers and their affiliates make investments in affiliates of Blackstone and perform
various financial advisory, investment banking and commercial banking services from time to time for us and our
affiliates and may, from time to time in the future engage in transactions with, or perform services for, us in the
ordinary course of their business.
