Risks relating to the ZF Group's Business and Industry,13.1.1,"We operate in a cyclical industry and our business could be adversely impacted by periodic downturns in target markets, in particular within the automotive industry.","Sales to our customers in the automotive industry of our business sectors Cars and light commercial vehicles and Commercial vehicles (which together generated by far the largest part of our sales in the current and in the preceding financial year) are cyclical and depend, among other things, on general economic conditions as well as on consumer spending and preferences, which can be affected by a number of factors, including the currently observed effects from and in connection with measures taken against the SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus) pandemic, employment, consumer confidence and income, energy costs, regulatory requirements, interest rate levels, inflation and the availability of consumer financing. Sales to our customers of our business sector Construction and agricultural machinery, marine craft, aircraft, special and rail vehicles and wind power primarily depend, among other things, on fiscal policies, infrastructure programs or consumer behavior in general in certain countries or industry sectors. Due to this wide variety of factors influencing our markets, the demand for our products is characterized by volatility. In addition, automotive and industrial original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) generally do not commit to purchasing minimum quantities from their suppliers. These uncertainties make it difficult for us to accurately estimate the ideal level of production capacity or reliably predict our future working capital requirements. The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could in turn adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and, as applicable, the Guarantee or cause the market price of the Notes to decline.",N/A,as_expected,2020,234

Risks relating to the ZF Group's Business and Industry,13.1.2,Our business could suffer if we are not able to develop new technologies and/or if we cannot keep pace with the technical developments of our competitors.,"Our customers demand increasingly complex and innovative solutions to meet their needs. The ability to anticipate technological trends and respond to customer needs by developing innovative solutions in a timely manner is crucial to major parts of our business. For example, the markets for automotive vehicles and, as a result, our business with OEM customers, are currently subject to a number of market trends and technical developments to which we are required to respond. These include an increasing level of standardization due to further globalization, tighter emissions regulations and the uncertainty ----- about the future of the traditional combustion engine in general and the diesel technology in particular and its unknown legal implications, growing environmental awareness and an increasing demand for vehicle safety, as well as for autonomous driving functionalities. We also face a major change in electronic architectures and a shift from hardware to software defined technologies. There is also the ""new-energy"" vehicle quota in the People's Republic of China (China), under which battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and fuel cell vehicles must account for a certain share of manufacturers' new vehicle fleets. As a result of these and further market trends and technical developments, the vehicle mix sold by our customers and the technical features thereof have shifted considerably in the last few years and is also expected to change further in the future, and we may not be able to successfully foresee and assess these changes and to successfully adapt and implement our strategy for the future development of the Group. This is particularly relevant as the development of products sold by us and the ramp-up of new product lines requires substantial amounts of time and investment, including research and production costs. We currently generate a substantial portion of our sales with products based on the combustion engine driveline. The progressive electrification in the passenger car and commercial vehicle segment, as well as other technological changes, may jeopardize our market position, and we may not be successful to foresee and adapt to these developments by stepping up sufficient activities in these new sectors and to successfully expand our expertise in new technologies. New technologies may also be disruptive and change the entire market environment of a product, which constitutes a further specific risk. In addition, innovative and increasingly complex products and solutions are particularly exposed to the risk of yet unknown and/or undetected defects and errors which in turn may expose us to increased risk from warranty and product liability claims (see also ""Products that do not meet customer specifications _or that contain, or are perceived to contain, defects or errors or that are otherwise incompatible with their intended end use could impose significant costs on us, including from warranty and product liability claims. In addition, quality risks could also damage our reputation.""). If we fail to innovate_ and develop new solutions, fail to develop enough new solutions to generate sufficient sales, or if our future solutions fail to receive regulatory approval, or if we fail to introduce new products of sufficient quality or are otherwise unsuccessful to adapt our business to trends, technical developments or customer demand, this failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could in turn adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and, as applicable, the Guarantee or cause the market price of the Notes to decline. Generally, ZF is also facing risks regarding sustainability and environmental protection. This is a particular consequence of increased civil awareness and respective demands resulting from the debate on climate change. Relevant legislative and regulatory action is implemented worldwide. Significant past investments were required to improve our environmental performance in preparation for new regulations or customer expectations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,234
267,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to the ZF Group and its Business I. Risks relating to the ZF Group's Business and Industry,13.1.3,"Adverse developments in the global economic environment and disruptions in financial markets, in particular those caused by the current global Coronavirus pandemic, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.","We are exposed to substantial risks associated with the performance of the global economy and global financial markets. In general, demand for automotive products and services as well as for the industrial sectors is highly cyclical and directly related to the strength of the global economy. Therefore, our income and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, influenced by the general state and the performance of the global economy. The state of the economy could be affected by geopolitical instability. As a result of the continuing trade conflicts between the United States and China, there is a risk that more countries could be affected. In addition, the consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU (Brexit) are uncertain, with respect to the EU integration process, the relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU and the impacts on economies and businesses, and declines in demand for our products as well as potential trade difficulties have to be expected. Another example for the fact that political upheaval in individual countries and diplomatic tensions between them can lead to turbulence on the financial markets and to unfavorable global market developments has been the ratification of the ----- United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USCMA). The uncertain political development in North America as well as growing tendencies towards protectionism and potential restrictions and limitations impacting international trade may have a negative impact on the export economy in general, and on our sales and results of operations in particular. We particularly see the risk that individual countries might take further protectionist measures when trying to protect or improve their competitiveness on the global market, and other countries may institute corresponding counter-measures. This might result in market access barriers, such as higher import duties or more complicated certification processes in order to reduce imports, up to an international trade war. Due to the current increase in protectionist tendencies around the world, we particularly see ourselves at risk from additional or higher tariffs on automobiles and on the products, components and raw materials we supply or purchase, with import duties instituted between the United States and China posing a particular ongoing threat and uncertainty. These and other measures and/or tariffs could lead to a growing uncertainty on the demand side and a decrease in the sales of vehicles, in demand for automotive products and services in the industrial sector, causing demand for our products to drop and/or costs to increase. Impending U.S. tariffs on vehicle and parts imports from global markets may significantly affect our value chains as well as those of our customers and suppliers and could be detrimental to our sales, profitability and financing conditions. Moreover, fiercer competition, especially in our key sales markets in Europe, the United States and China, may also adversely affect our sales development and sales prices. Most recently, the rapid global spread of the Coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a material deterioration of the conditions for the global economy, and financial markets have been materially affected. We expect that this development will adversely affect our business and result of operation. It could have adverse effects on our financial condition and our liquidity. While it is currently impossible to estimate and quantify the extent of its negative effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition, the Coronavirus pandemic poses material risks to our supply chains, our production, the sales of our products and the delivery of our services. These effects could for example be caused by restrictions on business activities of our suppliers, customers and ourselves, including our personnel, either discretionary or imposed by public authorities on a regional, national or international level, by unavailability of critical workforce, and by a material redirection of public health funds from our products and services to address the Coronavirus pandemic. These effects will be exacerbated the longer the Coronavirus pandemic lasts. There are numerous other factors that may have an impact on the global economy and also affect the demand for our products, such as a further economic slowdown in Argentina, Brazil, Russia, India and China, where we are widely operating. Economic downturns in these countries may particularly lead to declining sales and payment defaults. Low growth rates and trade barriers in China are of a particular risk to our Car Powertrain Technology, Car Chassis Technology, Electronics and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), Passive Safety Systems and Active Passive Safety Systems (formerly Active & Passive Safety), Commercial Vehicle Technology as well as our Industrial Technology and E-Mobility divisions. Any downturn in the European and global economies could cause demand in our relevant market segments to decline and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations, which could in turn (in particular in the event of a significant and sudden decline of our sales) adversely affect our financing conditions and our ability to meet our financial covenants and other obligations under our credit facilities or other indebtedness, and to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and, as applicable, the Guarantee or cause the market price of the Notes to decline.",N/A,as_expected,2020,234

We compete primarily on the basis of price, quality, timeliness of delivery and design as well as the ability to provide engineering support and service on a global basis. Should we fail to secure the quality of our products and the reliability of our supply in the future, then our customers could decide to procure products from our competitors. The automotive industry, in particular, has been characterized by rapid technological change, high capital expenditures, intense pricing pressure from major OEM customers, periods of oversupply and continuous advancements in process technologies and manufacturing facilities. New competitors enter the market, as well as new customers who bring new customer needs and demands to which we may be unable to adapt. We compete with other international suppliers and, to a lesser extent, regional companies. Increasing pricing-pressure in a more competitive market environment, combined with increased requirements concerning product performance and enhanced functionalities may create a challenge to offset effects from a price and cost perspective. If we became unable to offset price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and the realization of synergies, price reductions could negatively impact our profit margins. Furthermore, establishing a strong position in the Asian market is a key component of our global growth strategy. While the automotive supply market in Asia is already highly competitive, as the size of the Asian market, in particular in China, continues to be the world's biggest market with long term growth potential, additional competitors may seek to enter the Asian market, and may act aggressively to establish their market share, increasing competition further. Competition can lead to price reductions, reduced margins and an inability to gain or maintain market share. If we are unable to compete successfully, our sales, profitability and financial condition could be adversely affected. Continued insourcing coupled with increasing price pressure results in a particular need to implement cost-cutting measures in our divisions, which we may not be able to implement successfully. The spare parts business is particularly influenced by the increasing market power of wholesalers which is further increasing the already high price pressure (especially for merchandise) and recently resulted in a need to restructure our business divisions.

Defective products could result in loss of sales, loss of customers, and loss of market acceptance, in particular against the background that many of our products are important components which could have an impact on the overall safety, durability and performance of our customers' end product. In addition, where vehicle manufacturers are themselves exposed to product liability lawsuits, claims and/or vehicle recall claims due to products delivered by us, they may seek a contribution from us for any such liabilities and claims. Moreover, those manufacturers may attempt to modify or amend contractual terms and conditions concerning warranty and recall participation in the future. The risks arising from such warranty claims and product liability lawsuits, proceedings and other claims are insured up to levels we consider economically reasonable, but the insurance coverage could prove insufficient in individual cases. Additionally, any allegations of a defect in one of our products could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and market perception, which in turn could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This particularly applies to high-volume and safety-related products. We have supplied various designs of airbag control units (ACUs) to certain OEMs that include a common application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Electrical overstress (EOS) in ACUs has been observed in certain crash events involving certain vehicles where there is no airbag deployment. The investigation into this issue is ongoing and we are cooperating fully with our customers and the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Approximately 5.8 million vehicles equipped with our ACUs have been recalled by certain OEMs since 2016 on a voluntary basis.

The investigation into the incident is ongoing and it is uncertain whether and to what extent it might affect us and the outcome cannot be predicted at this time. Furthermore, as a general rule, we manufacture many products pursuant to OEM customer specifications and quality requirements. Where OEMs or end users allege that that the products manufactured and delivered by us do not meet the requirements stipulated by our OEM customers at the agreed date of delivery, we generally discontinue production of the relevant products until the cause of the alleged non-compliance has been identified and/or remedied.

We could be held responsible for the remediation of areas adjacent to our sites if these areas were contaminated due to our activities or activities of the former operator. In particular, soil, water or groundwater contamination has been discovered at our sites in Union Springs, New York (United States), Sullivan, Missouri (United States) and South Daton Dump/Dayton, Ohio (United ----- States) in the past as well as different public landfill remediation projects in the United States where ZF is part of the remediation superfunds. The competent authorities could assert claims against us, as the owner or tenant of the affected plots for the examination or remediation of such soil or groundwater contamination, or order us to dispose of or treat contaminated soil excavated in the course of construction. We could also be required to indemnify the owners of plots leased by us or of other properties, if the authorities were to pursue claims against the relevant owner of the property and if we caused the contamination. On several of the sites where contaminations have been discovered, remediation activities have already taken place upon order by or agreement with the competent authorities. Costs typically incurred in connection with such claims are generally difficult to predict. Also, if any contamination were to become a subject of public discussion, there is a risk that our reputation or relations with our customers could be harmed. Furthermore, at certain sites at which we operate, hazardous materials were used in the past, such as asbestos-containing building materials used for heat insulation. The health and safety of third parties (such as former employees) may have been affected due to the use of such hazardous materials and we could therefore be exposed to related damage claims in the future. We face similar risks with respect to former sites which we sold in the past. Even if we have contractually excluded or limited our liability in connection with the sale of such properties, we could be held responsible for currently unknown contamination on properties which we previously owned or used. In addition, manufacturers of friction lining materials are sometimes defendants in suits brought by individuals claiming personal injuries as a result of alleged exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products. Claims of this nature have been filed against certain of our subsidiaries in various jurisdictions (including the United States) as a result of sales of friction material containing asbestos made until the mid 1990s.

Furthermore, future disruptions in the financial markets, including the bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring of a number of financial institutions, and further changes in the regulatory environment affecting financial institutions could adversely impact the availability and cost of additional financing for us and could adversely affect the availability of financing already arranged or committed. Our liquidity could also be adversely impacted if our suppliers tighten terms of payment as the result of any decline in our financial condition or if our customers were to extend their normal payment terms.

Some of our existing financing arrangements also contain a financial covenant which requires us to maintain a specified financial ratio regarding the maximum level of net indebtedness (leverage) as well as a minimum level of liquid funds (including certain available credit commitments). According to our current financial projections, the relevant financial covenants included in our financing agreements will be observed. Other financing agreements or instruments that we may enter into or issue in the future may include similar covenants and financial covenants. In light of the cyclical nature of our business and the possible effects on our business activities and results of operations as well as the other market and business-related risks described herein, we may not be able to maintain our current sales and profitability at the levels required for meeting the EBIT related financial ratio or retain sufficient liquid funds to meet the minimum liquidity covenant. Hence, we cannot assure that we will continue to comply with these financial covenants in the future. A breach of any other covenant, as well as the inability to comply with the required financial ratio, could result in a default under the respective agreement or facility unless we can obtain waivers for the breach of any covenant or financial obligations thereunder. We cannot assure that such waivers will be granted by the respective lenders. In the event of any default under a financing agreement or instrument, the respective lenders will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us and could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, fees and other amounts due, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, indebtedness under other agreements or instruments that contain crossdefault or cross-acceleration provisions also may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. If any of our debt was to be accelerated, we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay such debt in full.

In 2014, the Brazilian Conselho Administrative de Defensa Economica (CADE) conducted an on-site inspection to investigate the alleged involvement of one of our Brazilian subsidiaries in anticompetitive pricing arrangements relating to car components. Antitrust procedures are also pending in Brazil against a subsidiary of ZF which relate to the alleged involvement of such subsidiary in anticompetitive agreements relating to other car components. If in any of these or other proceedings we are found to have breached antitrust regulations, we may be fined by the relevant authorities and we may become subject to follow-on claims for damages by third parties, including customers, based on such breaches. Specifically, ZF is currently exposed to damage claims by customers, following two decisions of the EU Commission in 2018 and 2019 regarding cartels in which TRW (acquired by ZF in 2015) was involved. The amount of any such fines and follow-on claims for damages cannot currently be determined with any certainty, but could be, individually or in the aggregate, substantial and may exceed provisions recorded by us in view of such proceedings. In addition, there is no assurance that current or future internal investigations that we conduct will not reveal further potential or actual non-compliance with competition laws. In addition, alleged or actual anti-competitive behavior might seriously disrupt business relationships with business partners. On June 10, 2020 the Stuttgart public prosecutor's office imposed a fine against ZF in the amount of EUR 42.5 million. ZF waived all legal remedies. While we are of the view that our current product portfolio is in line with the existing legal requirements that are applicable to us, due to the complexity of the issues involved, it cannot be excluded that other authorities or courts could conclude in individual cases in current or future proceedings and investigations that ZF has breached regulations. In such case, we could be liable to third parties including customers and may be fined by the relevant authorities and/or courts.

The process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive. Furthermore, patents may not be granted on currently pending or future applications or may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with meaningful protection or commercial advantage. In addition, while there is a presumption that patents are valid, the granting of a patent does not necessarily imply that it is effective or that possible patent claims can be enforced to the degree necessary or desired. Furthermore, a major part of our know-how and industrial secrets is not patented or cannot be protected through intellectual property rights. Consequently, there is a risk that certain parts of our know-how and trade secrets are transferred to collaboration partners, customers or suppliers. Granted patents for important products may also expire before these products are replaced by new products. This poses a risk that competitors will copy our know-how without incurring any expenses of their own or compensate us for that. Moreover, we have concluded a number of license, cross-license, and cooperation and development agreements with our customers, competitors and other third parties under which our Group is granted rights in industrial property and/or know-how of such third parties.

This applies also to air, water and soil pollution regulations and to waste legislation, all of which have recently become more stringent through new laws, in particular in the European Union and the United States. For instance, ISO 14001 is the Group standard for all our production and main development locations, and 246 of our plants are certified according to the British Standard for Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series 18001 (OHSAS). The number of OHSAS certified plants is steadily increasing. In addition, for our sites and operations, we require various permits and we have to comply with the requirements specified therein. In the past, adjusting to new requirements has required significant investments and we assume that further significant investments in this regard will be required in the future. Furthermore, any additional regulation restricting or limiting car traffic with an aim at reducing carbon emissions could lead to a material decrease in car sales and consequently adversely affect demand for our products and services. ----- Furthermore, an introduction of regional or international trade barriers, including tariffs such as those recently imposed by the United States on selected imports from a number of trading partners and a broad range of imports from China and retaliation by those trading partners and China, withdrawal from or renegotiation of bi- and multilateral trade agreements by the United States, or any countermeasures by regional or global trading partners, including the European Union, could have a negative impact on the global economic environment and thereby result in lower demand for the Group's products (also see ""Risks relating to the ZF Group's Business and Industry – Adverse _developments in the global economic environment could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.""). In particular, an increase in such protectionist_ tendencies globally may impose a risk of additional or higher tariffs on automobiles and on the products, components and raw materials the Group supplies or purchases. Any such development may cause demand for the Group's products to drop and costs to increase, and could have a negative impact on the Group's business, sales and earnings situation, the Group's supply chain, if suppliers are also negatively affected, or may lead to payment difficulties on the customers' side. In addition, any change in legislation concerning corporate income tax and other future changes in tax law in Germany or other countries in which we are subject to taxation could lead to higher tax expenses and also have the potential to significantly influence the development of the markets in which we operate generally. In addition, increasing taxes reducing the income available for consumption may also weaken the global demand in the automotive markets. Tax increases are a likely reaction of the national governments (especially of the EU member states) to the increase of national debt resulting from the various bailout programs set out for banks or, e.g., the stabilization package for EU member states.

The German tax authorities are at present performing a tax audit at ZF (and its German operating facilities) for the assessment periods 2012 through 2016. In ongoing or future tax audits, the tax laws or relevant facts, especially in relation to acquisitions or group restructuring activities, could be interpreted by the tax authorities in a manner deviating from the relevant company's view. As a result, the tax authorities could revise original tax assessments and substantially increase the tax burden (including interest and penalty payments) of the relevant company. So far, our companies have not been made aware by any tax auditor of any significant findings which would not be covered by the tax provisions and liabilities the respective company has accounted for. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that ongoing and/or future tax audits may lead to an additional tax expense and/or payment, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could in turn adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and, as applicable, the Guarantee or cause the market price of the Notes to decline.",N/A,as_expected,2020,234

The GILTI provision requires the company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on foreign subsidiary's tangible assets.

The final purchase price amounted to USD 7.04 billion and was financed through cash provided by ZF AG (including through entering into a EUR 7.3 billion syndicated credit facilities agreement dated March 28, 2019 (as amended from time to time, the last time on May 15, 2020) (the **_Syndicated Facilities Agreement), the issuance of several fixed rate and floating rate tranches of euro-denominated bonded loans (Schuldscheindarlehen) in the aggregate amount of EUR 2.0565 billion which were disbursed to ZF AG on October 25, 2019 and partially on January 20, 2020 and February 6, 2020 (the **_ZF Bonded Loans 2019) and the issuance of several tranches of fixed rate euro-denominated bonds in the aggregate principal amount of EUR 2.7 billion in October 2019, issued by ZF Europe Finance B. V., a wholly owned subsidiary of ZF AG, and guaranteed by ZF AG on an unconditional and irrevocable basis. The completion of the WABCO acquisition was subject to regulatory approvals and certain conditions to be fulfilled post closing. In this context the Indian merger control authority (CCI) has imposed remedies on ZF in order to grant approval for the WABCO acquisition. The remedies include the divestment of a part of ZF's local business (Brakes India Private Limited, Chennai) and may include financial risk. Due to the regulations in India, ZF had to issue a mandatory takeover offer for the remaining 25% outstanding shares in WABCO India Ltd., which have to be divested again within a 12month period to the market. This could result in financial gains or losses. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Justice demanded to sell WABCO’s shares in R.H. Sheppard Co. Inc. which was completed on June 3, 2020, in which market standard representations and warranties have been agreed upon in the sales documentation. The Chinese merger control authority (SAMR) imposed behavioural remedies which might negatively affect the future automated manual transmissions controller business in China. The implementation of the WABCO acquisition involves risks. For instance, the price paid as consideration for WABCO Group's shares may be considered too high by ZF’s investors, the WABCO acquisition may prove to be less successful than anticipated, WABCO's financial or operational performance – in addition to the current impact of the Coronavirus pandemic – may not develop as expected, or sales, earnings and cash flow goals pursued by way of the WABCO acquisition may not be met. In addition, the WABCO acquisition, as well as other potential acquisitions in the future, is subject to a number of risks, including unexpected losses of key employees; extraordinary or unexpected legal, regulatory, contractual and other costs; difficulties in integrating the financial, technological and management standards, processes, procedures and controls of WABCO and its subsidiaries with those of our existing operations; challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations; mitigating contingent and/or assumed liabilities; the possible loss of customers and/or suppliers; and control issues in relation to joint ventures and other arrangements where we do not exercise sole control. Hence, we may not be able to integrate WABCO Group into the ZF Group as planned or only at a higher cost than originally planned, and/or any intended synergy effects may not be realized to the extent planned or at all. ----- In addition, the WABCO acquisition may expose us to the following risks: - _Commitment of management capacity: The integration of WABCO Group into the ZF Group will require a large amount of the time and attention of both companies' management. If integration issues significantly divert management's attention from other responsibilities, our and WABCO Group's business could be adversely affected. - _Increased Indebtedness: As a result of the WABCO acquisition, our indebtedness increased considerably as a result of the financing obtained in connection with the WABCO acquisition (also see ""Risks relating to ZF Group and its business – Financial Risks – We are exposed to a _number of risks associated with our existing indebtedness."")._ - _Risks arising from Syndicated Facilities Agreement:_ The Syndicated Facilities Agreement contains certain undertakings, restrictions and covenants that restrict our operating flexibility. However, such undertakings, restrictions and covenants restrict us to a similar or same extent as the corresponding undertakings, restrictions and covenants in the Senior Facilities Agreement (as defined herein) restrict us. Furthermore, the Syndicated Facilities Agreement contains certain market-standard provisions, pursuant to which the lenders may terminate the Syndicated Facilities Agreement and accelerate all borrowings or, as applicable, cancel their commitments under the Syndicated Facilities Agreement. - _Possible loss of key employees: We (the ZF Group including the WABCO Group) depend on our respective key employees for the successful integration and implementation of a common strategy. The loss of key employees due to their combination or other reasons, could render a rapid integration and leveraging of the respective strengths of each company more difficult. In addition to the WABCO acquisition and other acquisitions made by the ZF Group, we continue to examine possibilities to expand our business through acquisitions. We may thus grow further through additional acquisitions. No guarantee can be given that additional suitable acquisition targets can be found or that further acquisitions that are identified as strategically important can be realized. The consummation of such further acquisitions may involve risks similar to those described above with regard to the WABCO acquisition. Divestments, on the other side, bear risks arising from the sale contract with the purchaser and that the achieved sale price is too low in the view of the market. Past and future investments made in joint ventures and acquisitions may weaken our financial profile, especially in the short term, which may result, among others, in rating downgrades. We may not realize the anticipated cost savings, synergies, future earnings or other benefits that we intend to achieve from acquisitions or joint ventures, or the acquired entities or established joint ventures may not develop as expected. We cannot guarantee that any acquisition or joint venture will yield benefits that are sufficient to justify the expenses we have incurred or will incur in completing such acquisition or joint venture. Furthermore, any acquisition or joint venture may not be as successful as the acquisitions or joint ventures that we have completed in the past. We could also take on additional risks as a result of acquisitions or joint ventures, including the risk of potential guarantee or liability claims resulting from the disposal of former business units or joint ventures.

IFRS, in particular the International Accounting Standard 36 (Impairment of Assets) (IAS 36), require us to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually, or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment, by using a single-step quantitative test performed at the level of a cash ----- generating unit (CGU) or group of CGUs which compares the carrying amount of a CGU or group of CGUs with its recoverable amount. The excess (if any) of the carrying amount over the recoverable amount has to be recorded as an impairment loss. Tangible and intangible assets with definite lives are not tested annually, we are required to assess at each reporting date whether there are any indicators of impairment. The impairment test itself only has to be carried out if there are such indicators and is also performed on a CGU or group of CGU level and an excess (if any) of the carrying amount over the recoverable amount has to be recorded as an impairment loss.

In 2019, approximately 77% of WABCO Group's combined sales occurred outside of the United States. Since the consummation of the Merger, WABCO's results will be included in ZF's consolidated financial statements and, therefore, be exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the reported local currencies of the WABCO Group companies and the Euro. Accordingly, fluctuations in the currency exchange rates could negatively impact its results of operations, especially fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies for the countries referred to above. The strengthening or weakening of the EUR may result in favourable or unfavourable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into EUR. - _Increasing WABCO Group's financial leverage could affect its operations and profitability. As of December 31, 2019, WABCO Group's total long term debt balance amounted to USD 828.3 million (December 31, 2018: USD 845.2 million). WABCO Group's indebtedness could affect its business and financial condition in various ways, including (i) increasing its interest expense under its revolving credit facilities or other variable-rate borrowing if interest rates were to rise, and (ii) potentially limiting its ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms, or at all. While WABCO Group believes that it will have the ability to service its debt, respect all of the covenants contained in the credit facilities and obtain additional capital in the future if and when needed, that will depend upon its results of operations and financial position at the time, the then-current state of the credit and financial markets, and ----- other factors that may be beyond its control. If WABCO Group is unable to service its debt or obtain additional capital in the future on favorable terms, its financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. - _Changes in factors that impact the determination of its non-U.S. pension liabilities may _adversely affect WABCO Group._ Certain of WABCO Group's non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans, which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service. WABCO Group's pension expense and its required contributions to its pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions WABCO Group uses to measure its defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value and the inflation rate. WABCO Group could experience increased pension expense due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of its pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in its assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets. WABCO Group could also experience increased other post-retirement expense due to decreases in the discount rate, increases in the health care trend rate and changes in demographics. If the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than WABCO Group's assumptions, this could have an adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. - _If WABCO Group is not able to maintain good relations with its employees, it could suffer _work stoppages that could negatively affect its business and results of operations._ Employees located in WABCO Group's sites in Europe, Asia and South America are subject to collective bargaining, with internal company agreements or external agreements at the region or country level. Currently approximately 50% of its workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements. Any disputes with WABCO Group's employee base could result in work stoppages or labor protests, which could disrupt its operations. Any such labor disputes could negatively affect WABCO Group's business and results of operations. - _WABCO Group is dependent on key customers. WABCO Group relies on several key customers. In the financial year ended December 31, 2019, WABCO Group's sales to its top ten customers accounted for approximately 48% of its sales. Many of its customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical industries and, as a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. As a result of its dependence on key customers, WABCO Group experienced and could experience in the future a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations if any of the following were to occur: (i) the loss of any key customer, in whole or in part, (ii) a declining market in which customers reduce orders or demand reduced prices, or (iii) a strike or work stoppage at a key customer facility, which could affect both its suppliers and customers. - _Risks relating to the separation of WABCO from American Standard. WABCO was spun off from American Standard Companies Inc. (American Standard) on July 31, 2007. Subsequent to the spin-off, American Standard changed its name to Trane Inc. (Trane). On June 5, 2008, Trane was acquired in a merger with Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited (Ingersoll Rand) and exists today as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand. WABCO Group is responsible for certain of Trane's contingent and other corporate liabilities. Under the indemnification and cooperation agreement, the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement, WABCO Group's wholly owned subsidiary WABCO Europe BVBA has assumed and is responsible for certain contingent liabilities related to Trane's business (including certain associated costs and expenses, whether arising prior to, at or after the distribution) and will indemnify Trane for these liabilities. Among the ----- contingent liabilities against which WABCO Group will indemnify Trane and the other indemnities are liabilities associated with certain non-U.S. tax liabilities and certain U.S. and non-U.S. environmental liabilities associated with certain Trane entities. In addition, all other risk factors described in this section ""Risk Factors"" generally also apply to the business of WABCO Group. WABCO Group's business may also be subject to additional risks that we may not be aware of and that may only emerge during the integration process. The merger agreement underlying the Merger provides, in line with market practice for acquisitions of public companies, that warranties and representations made by WABCO Group did not survive the closing of the acquisition. No warranties and representations were made by the previous shareholders of WABCO. We are therefore not in a position to assert claims against WABCO's previous shareholders based on risks, defects, losses and damages that may be identified during the integration process. If any of the business risks of WABCO Group proved to be more severe or if any unknown risks emerge, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could in turn adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and, as applicable, the Guarantee or cause the market price of the Notes to decline.",N/A,as_expected,2020,234

Risks relating to specific Terms and Conditions of the Notes,13.10.4,"Risks associated with the reform of LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rate benchmarks.","The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed ""benchmarks"" (each a Benchmark and together, the Benchmarks) have become the subject of regulatory scrutiny and recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective whilst others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause such Benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on any Notes linked to such a Benchmark. ----- International proposals for reform of Benchmarks include the European Council's regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of June 8, 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and 2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (the Benchmark Regulation) which is fully applicable since January 1, 2018. The Benchmark Regulation could have a material impact on Notes linked to a Benchmark, including in any of the following circumstances: - a rate or index which is a Benchmark may only be used if its administrator obtains authorization or is registered and in case of an administrator which is based in a non-EU jurisdiction, if the administrator's legal benchmark system is considered equivalent (Art. 30 Benchmark Regulation), the administrator is recognized (Art. 32 Benchmark Regulation) or the Benchmark is endorsed (Art. 33 Benchmark Regulation) (subject to applicable transitional provisions). If this is not the case, Notes linked to such Benchmarks could be impacted; and - the methodology or other terms of the Benchmark could be changed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmark Regulation, and such changes could have the effect of reducing or increasing the rate or level or affecting the volatility of the published rate or level, and could impact the Notes, including calculation agent determination of the rate. Interest amounts payable under floating rate Notes issued under the Programme are calculated by reference to (i) EURIBOR which is as at the date of this Prospectus provided by the European Money Markets Institute (EMMI), or (ii) LIBOR which is as at the date of this Prospectus provided by the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA). As at the date of this Prospectus, IBA and EMMI appear on the register of administrators and benchmarks established and maintained by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) pursuant to Art. 36 Benchmark Regulation. In addition to the aforementioned Benchmark Regulation, there are numerous other proposals, initiatives and investigations which may impact Benchmarks. Following the implementation of any such potential reforms, the manner of administration of Benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or Benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the FCA Announcement). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. If a Benchmark were to be discontinued or if its methodology were materially changed or if such Benchmark were otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest for floating rate Notes which are linked to such Benchmark will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such Notes, which in the end could lead, inter alia, to determination of the applicable interest rate on the basis of another benchmark determined by the Issuer in its discretion, or to a previously available rate of the Benchmark being applied until maturity of the floating rate Notes, effectively turning the floating rate of interest into a fixed rate of interest, or to an early termination of the relevant Notes at the option of the Issuer. Under these fallback provisions, the Benchmark will be substituted, if possible, by a replacement offered interest rate or an alternative offered interest rate determined by the Issuer (possibly after consultation with an independent adviser and possibly after application of adjustments or spreads). If this is not possible, the interest rate for the relevant interest period will be determined on the basis of the offered interest rate that was used for the last preceding interest period and such rate will continue to apply for future interest periods of the Notes until a replacement offered interest rate or an alternative offered interest rate will be determined by the Issuer in accordance with the fallback provisions. In addition, if, in the Issuer's opinion, it is not possible to determine a replacement offered interest rate or an alternative offered interest rate in accordance with the fallback provisions and if the Final Terms so provide, the Issuer will be entitled to call the Notes for redemption at their principal amount, together with interest accrued (if any). Due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of a ----- replacement offered interest rate or an alternative offered interest rate, the relevant further fallback provisions may not operate as intended at the relevant time. Any changes to a Benchmark as a result of the Benchmark Regulation or other initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the costs of refinancing a Benchmark or the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a Benchmark and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Although it is uncertain whether or to what extent any of the above-mentioned changes and/or any further changes in the administration or method of determining a Benchmark could have an effect on the value of any Notes linked to the relevant Benchmark, investors should be aware that any changes to a relevant Benchmark may have a material adverse effect on the value or liquidity of, and the amounts payable on, floating rate Notes whose rate of interest is linked to such Benchmark.",N/A,as_expected,2020,234

In April 2020, S&P lowered its long-term ratings to ZF AG to ""BB+"" and assigned a negative outlook. This downgrade happened due to the Coronavirus pandemic and its caused forecasted decline in global auto demand resulting in intense pressure on auto suppliers in 2020.

At the same time, Moody's lowered ZF's long-term corporate credit rating to ""Ba1"" with review for further downgrade. On June 16, 2020, Moody's has confirmed the Ba1 rating (outlook: negative).

'BB' indicates the least degree of speculation and 'C' the highest. While such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposure to adverse conditions.

We have production companies in approximately 27 countries, maintain 16 major development locations in Europe, North America, and Asia, and are headquartered in Friedrichshafen, Germany. We are primarily active in the automotive industry, in particular in the areas of transmission systems, active and passive safety systems, units and components, as well as chassis systems and components for passenger car and commercial vehicle manufacturers. However, our activities also cover other market segments such as construction and agricultural machinery, wind power, marine propulsion, aviation technology, rail drives, special drives and test systems. In 2019, by far the largest part of our sales were in the business sector Cars and light commercial vehicles below six tons, followed by sales in the business sector Commercial vehicles over six tons and the business sector Construction and agricultural machinery, marine craft, aircraft and wind power. Our strong presence in the world's largest automotive markets is complemented by a significant footprint in key emerging markets as we are continually expanding our global market presence. In recent years, particularly our operations outside of Western Europe have become increasingly important with not only the established markets in North and South America, Germany and Western Europe and Japan, but also the new markets in the Asia-Pacific region (especially China and India) and Eastern Europe playing a major role. We are expanding our global presence by adapting our products to specific customers and market requirements while considering the most cost effective country for production and procurement. We support the international expansion of our existing customers while also servicing new customers in the markets which we enter. In 2019, we already generated 54% (2018: 53%) of our sales outside our traditional markets in Europe (Germany, Western and Eastern Europe), in particular in North America (29%; 2018: 28%) and South America (3%; 2018: 3%) as well as the AsiaPacific region (21%; 2018: 21%), with China as the core market and India as the growth market. In addition to our primary product offering, we offer a wide range of services that are mainly marketed by our Aftermarket organization.

The ""Next Generation Mobility"" strategy builds upon the improvement of the following five core strategic targets: ""Innovation and Cost Leadership"", ""Balanced Market Penetration"", ""Financial Independence"", ""Globally Attractive Employer"" and ""Diversified Product Portfolio"". Due to megatrends such as e-mobility, autonomous driving, new mobility concepts, digitalization, urbanization, globalization, demographic change and the war for talents as well as scarce resources/energy efficiency and global warming, the automotive industry is currently experiencing a rapid change. Focusing on these megatrends with ""Next Generation Mobility"", we intend to tackle the massive on-going transformation with our broad portfolio serving the demands of the customers in the different markets. With our broad product portfolio, covering automated driving, e-mobility, integrated safety systems and vehicle motion control solutions, we are a global system supplier of mobility products and services for passenger cars, commercial vehicles as well as mobility-as-a-service solutions and industrial technology applications. In addition, we have set up our Internet of Things (IoT) cloud-based system in order to enable extensive networking between systems. We plan to be active globally and across all applications in these fields, namely for passenger cars, commercial vehicles, off-highway vehicles and industrial technology. ----- Regarding global markets, we seek to expand our presence in China to enable further development and the manufacturing of our complete product portfolio to support the local market in full. We already offer customers in China high-tech solutions for e-mobility and autonomous driving and we seek to continuously increase our existing customer base with Chinese manufacturers and new mobility providers. In order to further increase our footprint in China, we invest significantly in the expansion of our production capacities and on-site development in China. To highlight the importance of the Chinese market to ZF, our board member Dr. Holger Klein, with responsibility for the Asia-Pacific region, has been directing our business in this increasingly important region directly from ZF's China headquarters in Shanghai. In addition, in 2019 we opened a joint transmission in Jiaxing (China) together with Foton, a Chinese commercial vehicle manufacturer, to produce automatic commercial vehicle transmissions for the Chinese market. In 2015, as part of our ""Strategy 2025"", the Group acquired TRW and was able to integrate it into the corporate structure within a timeframe of about two years. During that time, we were also able to steadily reduce the debts incurred in connection with this acquisition and significantly increase investments in property, plant and equipment, as well as expenditure in research and development. Since then, we have made further acquisitions and entered into strategic partnerships, in particular in the field of mobility-as-a-service and automated guided vehicle growth markets. In 2019, the acquisition of WABCO constituted a further milestone in our corporate history (see ""General _Information on the Issuers and the Guarantor–ZF Friedrichshafen AG–General Information–History and Development"")._ In order to ensure that our organization and structure continues to meet all the requirements from the different markets and customers in the future, in 2018 we decided to adjust our organizational set-up in line with our strategy. One transformation was the introduction of a dual operating system that allows ZF Group to operate at different speeds and organizational modes.

In the financial year ended December 31, 2019, our R&D expenditure amounted to EUR 2,652 million (defined as R&D costs of EUR 2,270 million recognized in our consolidated statement of profit and loss and the capitalized development costs as inventories and intangible assets of EUR 409 million and excluding the respective amortization of the capitalized development costs of EUR 27 million) compared to R&D expenditure of EUR 2,501 million (R&D costs of EUR 2,158 million recognized in our consolidated statement of profit and loss and the capitalized development costs as inventories and intangible assets of EUR 361 million and excluding the respective amortization of the capitalized development cost of EUR 18 million) in the financial year ended December 31, 2018. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, our R&D expenditure amounted to EUR 1,210 million (R&D costs of EUR 1,063 million recognized in our consolidated statement of profit and loss and the capitalized development costs as inventories and intangible assets of EUR 159 million and excluding the respective amortization of the capitalized development cost of EUR 12 million) compared to R&D expenditure of EUR 1,285 million (R&D costs of EUR 1,129 million recognized in our consolidated statement of profit and loss and the capitalized development costs as inventories and intangible assets of EUR 168 million and excluding the respective amortization of the capitalized development cost of EUR 12 million) in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. We expect to continue to invest significantly in the years to come in order to further strengthen and expand the Group's position. Our R&D centers comprise 16 main development locations around the world including Friedrichshafen, Koblenz, Schweinfurt, Alfdorf, Düsseldorf, Dielingen, Passau and Auerbach in Germany, as well as Detroit (United States), Shanghai (China), Hyderabad (India), Czestochowa (Poland), Pilsen (Czech Republic), Solihull (UK), Vigo (Spain) and Yokohama (Japan). In 2019, we filed submitted a total of 3,007 patent applications worldwide, 1,979 of which were first-time patent applications. In April 2019, we set up our Software Competence Center. This new unit is developing basic modules for complex technical functions in a range of applications – for example, a fully automated forklift truck with a barcode-based guidance system. We believe that software will be one of the biggest influencing factors in the future development of vehicle systems, and a key differentiator in achieving higher levels of automation and we intend to help drive that trend. The ZF Group is also stepping up its attention to data analysis. The first functional version of our internet of things (IoT) cloud platform went live last October, with data storage and analytics functions that network our developers around the world, as well as the use of state-of-the-art development tools. Since the beginning of 2019, ZF has been investing heavily in setting up centers for artificial intelligence (AI) and cyber security in Friedrichshafen and Saarbrücken (Germany). We also established cooperations with the Helmholtz Center for Information Security (CISPA) and the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). As part of the ""Quality 360"" project, we are using artificial intelligence, for example, to set up a predictive model (digital twin) based on real processes so that we can optimize them and detect deviations at an early stage. Our R&D centers work in close cooperation in all key areas of product development with customers of the automotive industry and with customers with demands for non-automotive drive technology. We use tools, such as simulation and rapid prototyping, for developing increasingly complex products that involve mechatronics. Due to the high technological bandwidth mastered, ranging from mechanics via hydraulics, pneumatics and electro mechanics up to highly complex electronics and mechatronics systems, we are capable of realizing large-scale systems integration projects in-house. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,234

We are also subject to regulatory investigations and enforcement proceedings by various governmental authorities, including national and supranational antitrust authorities. In 2014, the Brazilian Conselho Administrative de Defensa Economica (CADE) conducted an on-site inspection to investigate the alleged involvement of one of our Brazilian subsidiaries in anticompetitive pricing arrangements relating to car components. Antitrust procedures are also pending in Brazil against a subsidiary of ZF which relate to the alleged involvement of such subsidiary in anticompetitive agreements relating to other car components. If in any of these or other proceedings we are found to have breached antitrust regulations, we may be fined by the relevant authorities and we may become subject to follow-on claims for damages by third parties, including customers, based on such breaches. Specifically, ZF is currently exposed to damage ----- claims by customers, following two decisions of the EU Commission in 2018 and 2019 regarding cartels in which TRW (acquired by ZF in 2015) was involved. The amount of any such fines and follow-on claims for damages cannot currently be determined with any certainty, but could be, individually or in the aggregate, substantial and may exceed provisions recorded by us in view of such proceedings. In addition, there is no assurance that current or future internal investigations that we conduct will not reveal further potential or actual non-compliance with competition laws. In addition, alleged or actual anti-competitive behavior might seriously disrupt business relationships with business partners. On June 10, 2020, the Stuttgart public prosecutor’s office imposed a fine against ZF in the amount of EUR 42.5 million in connection with its investigations of emission and consumption topics. ZF waived all legal remedies.

The Syndicated Facilities Agreement originally consisted of a term loan facility (bridge to capital market) in an amount of EUR 4.8 billion which has already been fully replaced through the issue of bonded loans and eurobonds (Facility A), a term loan facility in an amount of EUR 1.0 billion with maturity in March 2022 (Facility B) and a third term loan facility in an amount of EUR 1.5 billion with maturity in March 2024 (Facility C). As of June 30, 2020, both Facility B and Facility C are utilized in full. The terms of the Syndicated Facilities Agreement are substantially the same as the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement. Accordingly, the Syndicated Facilities Agreement contains customary events of default, the occurrence of which would allow for, among other things, the cancellation of the lenders' commitments or a declaration that all or part of the loans together with accrued interest and all other amounts outstanding under the Syndicated Facilities Agreement (and related agreements) are immediately due and payable. Interest payable in relation to Facility B and Facility C will be adjusted depending on the public long-term rating from certain rating agencies, increasing or decreasing dependent on such rating. The Syndicated Facilities Agreement also contains a mandatory prepayment event and termination right of a lender's commitment in case of a change of control with regard to ZF AG subject to a negotiation period. The Syndicated Facilities Agreement contains a number of affirmative and negative covenants customary for this type of financing which are subject to certain specified exceptions. These covenants include, among others, the obligation to provide financial statements and management accounts as well as acquisition related information and also comprise certain other customary information obligations. The restrictive covenants include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the incurrence of financial indebtedness in respect of ZF AG's subsidiaries, asset disposals, the granting of security (so-called negative pledge), loans and guarantees out, corporate restructurings, change of business, and substantial change of the general nature of the business of the ZF Group. Furthermore, ZF must ensure that the ratio of its consolidated total net borrowings to its consolidated adjusted EBITDA (calculated in accordance with certain parameters stipulated by the Syndicated Facilities Agreement) does not exceed certain thresholds. According to the terms of the Syndicated Facilities Agreement, ZF must ensure that the aforementioned ratio does not exceed 5.50:1 until and including March 31, 2021; thereafter the aforementioned ratio is reduced in certain pre-defined steps to 3.75:1 until and including December 31, 2021 and finally to 3.25:1 (which ratio must be observed from ----- December 31, 2023). The Syndicated Facilities Agreement also provides for an obligation of ZF to maintain liquid funds, including certain available credit facilities (determined in accordance with certain parameters stipulated by the Senior Facilities Agreement) of not less than EUR 1,500,000,000; such obligation however only applies from June 30, 2020 to June 30, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2020,234

On May 29, 2020, ZF AG closed the Merger with WABCO. The final purchase price amounted to USD 7.04 billion and was financed through cash provided by ZF AG (including through the Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the ZF Bonded Loans 2019 and the Existing NL ZF Bonds, each described under ""Material Contracts"" above).

In a second phase, WABCO will be combined with the existing Commercial Vehicle Technology division of ZF Group to form an integrated Commercial Vehicle Systems division. The completion of the WABCO acquisition was subject to regulatory approvals and certain conditions to be fulfilled post closing. On June 2, 2020 ZF AG completed the sale of R.H. Sheppard Co., Inc.
