## Cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements

This listing memorandum includes ‘‘forward-looking statements’’ within the meaning of Section 27A of
the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking
statements include statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events,
future revenue or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to
acquisitions, business trends and other information that is not historical information and, in particular,
appear under the headings ‘‘Summary,’’ ‘‘Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations,’’ ‘‘Industry overview’’ and ‘‘Business.’’ When used in this listing
memorandum (including with respect to full year 2002 data), the words ‘‘estimates,’’ ‘‘expects,’’
‘‘anticipates,’’ ‘‘projects,’’ ‘‘plans,’’ ‘‘intends,’’ ‘‘believes,’’ ‘‘forecasts,’’ or future or conditional verbs,
such as ‘‘will,’’ ‘‘should,’’ ‘‘could’’ or ‘‘may,’’ and variations of such words or similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, including, without
limitation, management’s examination of historical operating trends and data are based upon our
current expectations and various assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are
expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be
no assurance that management’s expectations, beliefs and projections will be achieved.

There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially
from the forward-looking statements contained in this listing memorandum. Important factors that
could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make in this
listing memorandum are set forth in this listing memorandum, including under the heading ‘‘Risk
factors.’’ As stated elsewhere in this listing memorandum, such risks, uncertainties and other
important factors include, among others:

� our substantial leverage;

� limitations on flexibility in operating our business contained in our debt agreements;

� increases in interest rates;

� our dependence on our largest customers;

� the possibility that our owners’ interests will conflict with ours;

� the highly competitive automotive parts industry;

� the cyclicality of automotive production and sales;

� pricing pressures from our customers;

� risks associated with our non-U.S. operations;

� risks related to our ability to operate on a stand-alone basis, separate from our former parent,
TRW;

� fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

� product liability and customer warranty and recall claims;

� changes to environmental and automotive safety regulations;

� increasing costs for purchased components and raw materials;

� non-performance by, or insolvency of, our suppliers;

� work stoppages;

� our ability to attract and retain skilled employees, particularly engineers and other employees
with electronics and software expertise; and

� economic, regulatory and political conditions domestically and internationally.

There may be other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the
forward-looking statements.

-----

All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf apply only as of the
date of this listing memorandum and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary
statements included in this listing memorandum. We undertake no obligation to update or revise
forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the
date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

## Market and industry data and forecasts

This listing memorandum includes industry data and forecasts that we obtained from industry
publications and surveys and internal company surveys. As noted in this listing memorandum, CSM
Worldwide and J.D. Powers & Associates were the primary sources for third-party industry data and
forecasts. We accept responsibility for correctly reproducing such data. Industry publications and
surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from
sources believed to be reliable, but there can be no assurance as to the accuracy or completeness
of included information. We have not independently verified any of the data from third-party sources
nor have we ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein. Statements as to
our market position relative to our competitors are based on CSM Worldwide data, except for
statements as to our market position in engine valves, which are based on our internal analysis and
estimates of supply positions for our and our competitors’ engine valve products.

## SEC review

In the course of the review by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the ‘‘SEC,’’ of the
registration statement for the exchange offers which we have filed with the SEC on July 1, 2003, we
may be required to make changes to the description of our business and other information and
financial data included in this listing memorandum. We believe that the financial statements and the
pro forma financial data included in this listing memorandum have been prepared in a manner that
complies, in all material respects, with regulations published by the SEC and consistent with current
practice. Comments by the SEC on our financial data in the registration statement for the exchange
offers required by the registration rights agreements may require modification or reformulation of the
data we present in this listing memorandum. Any such modification or reformulation may be
significant.

## Exchange rate information

The euro was launched as the single European currency on January 1, 1999. Given its recent
introduction, there is insufficient historical exchange rate data concerning the euro for inclusion in this
listing memorandum. As a result, this section also provides historical exchange rate data concerning
the European Currency Unit, or ECU. The ECU, the predecessor to the euro, is a composite
currency, consisting of specified amounts of currencies of 12 European Union member states. The
ECU basket is composed of specified amounts of the German mark, the U.K. pound sterling, the
French franc, the Italian lira, the Dutch guilder, the Belgian franc, the Luxembourg franc, the Danish
kroner, the Irish punt, the Greek drachma, the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo. In
accordance with European Council Regulation No. 1103/97, substitution of the euro for the ECU is at
the rate of one euro for one ECU. Since the United Kingdom, Denmark and Greece are not currently
participating in the European Monetary Union, some of the currencies (U.K. pound sterling, Danish
kroner and Greek drachma) in the ECU basket will not be considered for euro purposes. Accordingly,
ECU exchange rates cannot be regarded as perfectly comparable with euro exchange rates for
historical purposes.

#### Our company

We are among the world’s largest and most diversified suppliers of automotive systems, modules and
components to global automotive vehicle manufacturers, or VMs, and related aftermarkets. We
conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. These operations primarily
encompass the design, manufacture and sale of active and passive safety related products. Active
safety related products principally refer to vehicle dynamic controls (primarily braking and steering),
and passive safety related products principally refer to occupant restraints (primarily air bags and
seat belts) and crash sensors. We are primarily a ‘‘Tier-1’’ supplier (a supplier which sells directly to
VMs), with over 85% of our sales in 2002 made directly to VMs. Our products are primarily used in
the manufacture of light vehicles, consisting of passenger cars and light trucks (which includes vans
and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs)). Our products were on all of the ten highest volume light vehicle
automotive platforms in the world in 2002. Our pro forma sales, pro forma earnings before interest,
loss on sale of receivables, gain on retirement of debt, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(‘‘EBITDA’’) and pro forma net earnings were approximately $10.4 billion, $1.1 billion and $0.2 billion,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002 and approximately $5.8 billion, $0.6 billion and
$0.1 billion, respectively, for the six months ended June 27, 2003. See note (2) in ‘‘—Summary
historical and pro forma financial data’’ for a reconciliation of EBITDA to net earnings and ‘‘Unaudited
pro forma combined and consolidated statements of operations.’’

We have become a leader in the global automotive parts industry by capitalizing on the strength of
our products, technological capabilities and systems integration skills. We believe that we have a top
three market position in each of the following product lines: foundation brakes, anti-lock braking
systems (ABS), steering gears and systems, seat belts, air bags and engine valves. In the
aggregate, these product lines accounted for approximately 61% of our 2002 sales. Over the last
decade, we have experienced substantial sales growth in many of these product lines due to an
increasing focus by both governments and consumers on safety and fuel efficiency. We believe that
this trend is continuing, as evidenced by ongoing regulatory activities, and will enable us to
experience significant growth in the most recent generation of advanced safety and fuel efficient
products, such as electronic vehicle stability control systems (VSC), curtain air bags, occupant
sensing systems and electrically assisted power steering systems. See ‘‘Business—Regulatory
environment.’’ Throughout our long history as a leading supplier to major VMs, we have focused on
products where we believe we have a technological advantage. We have extensive technical
experience in a broad range of product lines and strong systems integration skills, which enable us to
provide comprehensive, systems-based solutions for our VM customers.

We have established a broad global presence, with a workforce of approximately 63,000 employees
and a network of manufacturing facilities, technical centers, sales offices and joint ventures located in
every major vehicle producing region of the world. We have 145 wholly-owned manufacturing
facilities and 20 joint-venture facilities in 22 countries. We sell to all the major VMs across the world’s
major vehicle producing regions. Among our largest customers are Ford Motor Company,
DaimlerChrysler AG, General Motors Corporation, Volkswagen AG and Renault-Nissan BV. Our
geographic breakdown of sales is among the most diverse in the industry, with approximately 49% of
our 2002 sales derived from North America, 43% from Europe and 8% from the rest of the world. No
single customer accounted for more than 20% of our 2002 sales, which, we believe, is among the
lowest customer concentration levels of major global Tier-1 suppliers. The following charts illustrate
our diversity by providing a breakdown of our 2002 sales by product lines and by VM groups.*

(‘‘TKS’’), which was not transferred to us as part of the Acquisition. See ‘‘Unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated
statements of operations’’ and ‘‘Business-Legal proceedings.’’ TKS produced steering gears, and the majority of TKS
sales were to Toyota.

#### Our competitive strengths

We intend to leverage our leading market positions, global presence, strong customer relationships
and diverse product capabilities to increase our presence in the global automotive parts industry.

3


-----

� **_Leading market positions._** We are one of the world’s largest suppliers of automotive
chassis and occupant safety products. We believe that our leading supply position across
a number of product lines increases our importance to our VM customers and allows us to
compete effectively in each of the markets that we serve. We believe that, based on 2001
sales, our market positions in North America and Europe combined for the following
product lines are as follows:

**2001 Combined North America And**
**Product Line** **Operating Segment** **Europe Market Position**

Foundation brakes . . . . . . . . Chassis Systems #1
ABS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Chassis Systems #3
Steering gears and systems . Chassis Systems #1
Air bags . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Occupant Safety Systems #2
Seat belts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Occupant Safety Systems #1
Engine valves . . . . . . . . . . . Other Automotive #2

� **_Global presence with diversified businesses._** We believe our geographically diverse
global manufacturing base offers us an advantage over many of our competitors in
meeting the global needs of our VM customers. We also believe that our global presence
allows us to leverage sales to a customer in one location, or for one product, into sales to
that customer in other locations and for other products. We believe our diversified
business limits our exposure to the risks of any one geographic economy, product line or
major customer.

� **_Strong relationships with customers._** As a result of our focus on providing high quality
products and service at competitive prices, we maintain long-standing relationships with
our customers, which include every major VM in the world.

� **_Well positioned for convergence of active and passive safety technologies._** We
believe that we are the only supplier that combines a broad customer base and
geographic diversity with leading positions in both key active safety technologies, such as
braking and steering, and key passive safety technologies, such as air bags and seat
belts. We believe that there are significant opportunities to enhance automotive safety
through technology that uses information from active safety systems to optimize the
performance of passive safety systems, and that our leading positions in both active and
passive safety technologies will allow us to benefit from this convergence.

� **_Strong base of awarded business._** Based on the existing platforms for which we
currently produce products and business awarded to us over the past several years, we
believe we will be able to grow our sales over the next several years at a rate higher than
the growth rate in global light vehicle production over the same period of time due to an
increase in our market shares and/or an increase in the content per vehicle of certain
product lines in our portfolio. Our ability to realize future sales, however, is subject to a
number of factors, including the actual volume and timing of vehicle production, option mix
and product pricing.

#### Our strategy

We intend to increase our sales and improve our profitability and operating cash flow by leveraging
our position as a leading Tier-1 global automotive parts supplier focused primarily in the areas of
active and passive safety technologies. Key elements of our strategy, which we expect will help
increase our product content per vehicle, include the following:

4


-----

� **_Expand our leading technological capabilities._** We believe that our leading market
positions are largely based on the strength of our technological capabilities. We expect to
continue to make significant investments in technology and our design capabilities in an
effort to develop innovative, value-added safety technologies with a focus on the
development of next generation safety systems.

� **_Focus on operating efficiency._** We continue to focus on opportunities to optimize our
resources and reduce manufacturing costs by, among other things, executing strategic
initiatives aimed at improving our operating performance and shifting production capacity
from high wage areas to low wage areas. In addition, we focus on realizing cost savings in
the purchase of manufactured components and raw materials and achieving benefits from
our restructuring activities to help us offset the impact of price decreases to our VM
customers.

� **_Capitalize on the continued trend toward system and module supply._** VMs are
increasingly purchasing integrated systems and modules from suppliers rather than
purchasing and assembling the separate components that are included in those systems
and modules. In order to capitalize on this trend, we have developed, and continue to
develop, significant system and module capabilities in a number of key product areas.

� **_Pursue joint ventures and other alliances._** We intend to continue pursuing joint
ventures and other alliances in order to expand our geographic and customer diversity.
These relationships have enabled us to enter into new geographic markets, to acquire new
customers and to develop new technologies. We currently have 20 joint ventures in 10
countries.

#### Risks related to our strategy

Our ability to execute our strategy is subject to certain risks that are generally associated with being
a global Tier-1 automotive supplier. For example, unforeseen competing technologies may emerge,
customer markets for our new technologies might not develop as expected, and we may experience
increased pressure on our margins. In addition, our strategy to increase operating efficiencies by
moving to lower wage countries may lead to resource constraints at our joint ventures and strategic
alliances which could have a negative impact on their ability to meet customers’ demands in local
markets, thereby adversely affecting out relationships with those customers globally.

#### Industry trends

We expect to capitalize on a number of important trends in the automotive parts industry that have
benefited us in the past and we believe will continue to benefit us in the future. These trends include:

� **_Focus on safety._** Consumers, and therefore VMs, are increasingly focused on, and
governments are increasingly requiring, improved safety in vehicles. Advances in
technology by us and others have led to a number of innovations in our product portfolio,
such as electronic vehicle stability control systems, tire pressure monitoring systems,
occupant sensing systems, rollover sensing and curtain air bag systems.

� **_Globalization of suppliers._** To serve multiple markets more cost effectively, many VMs
are manufacturing global vehicle platforms, which typically are designed in one location
but are produced and sold in many different geographic markets around the world. Having
operations in the geographic markets in which VMs produce global platforms enables
suppliers to meet VMs’ needs more economically and efficiently.

� **_Shift of engineering to suppliers._** Increasingly, VMs are focusing their efforts on
consumer brand development and overall vehicle design, as opposed to the design of

5


-----

individual vehicle systems. In order to simplify the vehicle design and assembly processes
and reduce their costs, VMs increasingly look to their suppliers to provide fully engineered,
pre-assembled combinations of components in systems and modules rather than individual
components.

� **_Increasing electronic content and electronics integration._** The electronic content of
vehicles has been increasing and, we believe, will continue to increase in the future.

� **_Increased emphasis on speed-to-market._** As VMs are under increasing pressure to
adjust to changing consumer preferences and to incorporate technological advances, they
are shortening product development times. Suppliers that are able to deliver new products
to VMs in a timely fashion to accommodate the VMs’ needs will be well positioned to
succeed in this evolving marketplace.

� **_Ongoing automotive supplier consolidation._** The worldwide automotive parts industry
is consolidating as suppliers seek to achieve operating synergies through business
combinations, shift production to locations with more flexible work rules and practices,
acquire complementary technologies, build stronger customer relationships and follow their
customers as they expand globally. The cost focus of most major VMs has forced
suppliers to reduce costs and improve productivity on an ongoing basis, including by
achieving economies of scale through consolidation.

#### The Transactions

On November 18, 2002, an entity controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (‘‘Blackstone’’)
entered into an agreement pursuant to which it agreed to cause us to purchase substantially all of
the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities (other than certain indebtedness) associated
with TRW’s automotive business from Northrop Grumman for which we paid a purchase price of
$4,443 million (excluding assumed debt of $210 million), subject to post-closing adjustments, of
which $3,533 million was paid in cash at closing. In this listing memorandum, we refer to this
acquisition as the ‘‘Acquisition.’’ Northrop Grumman acquired these assets and liabilities in its
December 11, 2002 acquisition of TRW.

In connection with the Acquisition, TRW Automotive Holdings Corp., a newly-formed Delaware
corporation that is our indirect parent (‘‘TRW Automotive Holdings’’), received a cash equity
contribution of $698 million primarily from affiliates of Blackstone in exchange for shares of its
common stock. Our management group also contributed cash in exchange for shares of TRW
Automotive Holdings’ common stock. TRW Automotive Holdings made a cash equity contribution of
$698 million and contributed newly issued shares of its common stock having an implied value of
$170 million to TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings Corp., a newly-formed Delaware corporation
that is our direct parent (‘‘TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings’’), and thereby acquired all of the
equity interests in it. TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings issued a $600 million face amount
subordinated 8% pay-in-kind note due 2018 to an affiliate of Northrop Grumman to acquire the stock
of certain subsidiaries, and contributed such stock together with a cash equity contribution of $698
million and the $170 million of TRW Automotive Holdings common stock to our company, TRW
Automotive, and thereby acquired all of the equity interests in us. We used (1) the $698 million cash
equity contribution, (2) borrowings under our new senior secured term loan A facility, (3) borrowings
under our new senior secured term loan B facilities, (4) proceeds from the offering of the dollar senior
notes and the euro senior notes, (5) proceeds from the offering of the dollar senior subordinated
notes and the euro senior subordinated notes and (6) proceeds from sales by certain of our
subsidiaries of receivables in connection with our new receivables facility, to fund the cash portion of
the purchase price and to repay a $35 million promissory note issued by an affiliate of Blackstone to
an affiliate of Northrop Grumman to acquire one of the Korean subsidiaries of our predecessor
company, and we used the $170 million of TRW Automotive Holdings common stock to fund the
stock portion of the purchase price. The purchase price also included a $105 million short-term note

6


-----

payable to Northrop Grumman reflecting certain estimated post-closing adjustments, subject to final
negotiations. In addition, we assumed approximately $210 million of indebtedness of TRW’s
automotive business, representing the outstanding amount of £95 million of 10.875% Lucas
Industries plc debentures due 2020 (‘‘Lucas Varity senior notes’’) that were assumed by TRW in
connection with its acquisition of Lucas Varity in 1999, plus accrued interest, and certain other
indebtedness. At the closing of the Acquisition, we also drew down $12 million of borrowings under
our new senior secured revolving credit facility. See note 1 to ‘‘—Sources and uses of funds.’’ The
fees and expenses associated with the Acquisition and the related financings were approximately
$193 million. See ‘‘The Acquisition,’’ ‘‘Use of proceeds,’’ ‘‘Capitalization’’ and ‘‘Description of other
indebtedness.’’

As a result of the Acquisition, currently affiliates of Blackstone hold approximately 78.5%, an affiliate
of Northrop Grumman holds approximately 19.6% and our management group holds approximately
1.9%, of the capital stock of TRW Automotive Holdings.

As used in this listing memorandum, the term ‘‘Transactions’’ means, collectively, the Acquisition and
the related financings described above.

(1) The revolving credit facility provides for borrowings of up to $500 million. At the closing of the Acquisition, we drew
down $12 million from the revolving credit facility, which we repaid on March 4, 2003 with general corporate funds. At
the closing of the Acquisition, JPMorgan Chase Bank (the ‘‘escrow agent’’), acting for the benefit of management and
employees of TRW Automotive, subscribed for and purchased $12 million of shares of common stock of TRW
Automotive Holdings with the proceeds of a promissory note issued to TRW Automotive. On March 25, 2003, TRW
Automotive Holdings repurchased a portion of such shares from the escrow agent (and affiliates of Blackstone
purchased the balance of such shares from the escrow agent) and the note was repaid. On March 25, 2003,
management and employees of TRW Automotive subscribed for and purchased the number of shares of common stock
of TRW Automotive Holdings repurchased by TRW Automotive Holdings from the escrow agent.

(2) Short-term note payable to Northrop Grumman reflecting certain estimated post-closing working capital adjustments,
subject to final negotiations.

(3) On July 22, 2003, we refinanced $200 million of the borrowings under the term loan A facility and all of the borrowings
under the term loan B facilities with the proceeds of new term C facilities, together with approximately $46 million of
cash, in order to reduce our interest expense. See ‘‘Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations—Liquidity and capital resources and ‘‘Description of other indebtedness—Senior credit facilities.’’

us that they intend to make a market in the notes and, if
issued, the exchange notes. The initial purchasers are not
obligated, however, to make a market in the notes or, if
issued, the exchange notes, and any such market-making
may be discontinued by the initial purchasers in their
discretion at any time without notice. See ‘‘Plan of

## Risk factors

Investing in the notes involves substantial risk. You should carefully consider all the information in
this listing memorandum prior to investing in the notes. In particular, we urge you to consider
carefully the factors set forth under the heading ‘‘Risk factors’’ beginning immediately after this
‘‘Summary.’’ In addition to those risks described in the ‘‘Risk factors’’ section, our ability to execute
our strategies described in this ‘‘Summary’’ and elsewhere in this listing memorandum is subject to
certain risks that are generally associated with being a Tier-1 automotive supplier. For example,
unforeseen competing and/or alternative technologies could emerge that render our technologies less
desirable or obsolete, customer markets for our new technologies might not develop as expected,
making it difficult for us to recover our development costs, and we may experience increased
pressure on our margins. In addition, our ability to increase operating efficiencies by moving to lower
wage countries may strain regional and global supply chains, and potential resource constraints at
our joint ventures and strategic alliances could have a negative impact on their ability to meet
customers’ demands in local markets, thereby adversely affecting our relationships with those
customers globally.

#### Summary historical and pro forma financial data

The summary historical financial data of the Predecessor as of December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002
and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002 have been derived from the
audited combined financial statements of our predecessor company. The summary historical financial
data of the Predecessor for the six months ended June 28, 2002 and for the two months ended
February 28, 2003 have been derived from the unaudited combined financial statements of our
predecessor company which, in each case, have been prepared on a basis consistent with the
Predecessor’s audited annual combined financial statements. The summary historical financial data
of the Successor as of June 27, 2003 and for the four months ended June 27, 2003 have been
derived from our unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements and have been
prepared on a different basis from the Predecessor’s annual combined financial statements under the
purchase method of accounting as a result of the consummation of the Acquisition on February 28,
2003. In the opinion of management, such unaudited financial data reflects all adjustments,
consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results
for those periods. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for the full year or any future period. The combined financial statements of
the Predecessor as of December 31, 2001 and 2002 and for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2002 and for the six month period ended June 28, 2002 and for the two month
period ended February 28, 2003, and the consolidated financial statements of the Successor as of
June 27, 2003 and for the four months ended June 27, 2003 are included elsewhere in this listing
memorandum. The following financial information for the periods prior to the Transactions may not
reflect what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had we
operated as a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented, or what our results of
operations, financial position and cash flows will be in the future.

The summary pro forma financial data for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the six months
ended June 28, 2002 and June 27, 2003 have been prepared to give pro forma effect to the
Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1 of each period. The summary pro forma financial
data is for informational purposes only and should not be considered indicative of actual results that
would have been achieved had the Transactions actually been consummated on the dates indicated
and do not purport to indicate results of operations as of any future date or for any future period. The
following data should be read in conjunction with ‘‘The Acquisition,’’ ‘‘Unaudited pro forma combined
and consolidated statements of operations,’’ ‘‘Management’s discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations’’ and the combined financial statements of our predecessor
company and our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this listing memorandum.

(1) Includes miscellaneous income and expense items from operations. See note 9 to the combined financial statements and
note 8 to the unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements for further detail.

(2) EBITDA, a measure used by management to measure performance, is reconciled to net earnings (losses) in the following
table. Our management believes EBITDA is useful to the investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts,
investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. EBITDA is not a recognized term
under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to net earnings (losses) as an indicator of operating performance
or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Because not all companies use identical calculations,
this presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additionally,
EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not consider
certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. The amounts shown
for EBITDA as presented herein differ from the amounts calculated under the definition of EBITDA used in our debt
instruments. The definition of EBITDA used in our debt instruments is further adjusted for certain cash and non-cash
charges and is used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such
as incurring additional debt and making certain payments.

(a) Significant restructuring actions were taken over the last several years as described more fully in the
‘‘Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations’’ section of this listing
memorandum. While we continuously evaluate whether additional restructuring opportunities exist to increase our
operating efficiencies, we do not have any current plans that would result in additional restructuring charges of the
magnitude that we incurred in 2000 and 2001.

(4) For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings represents earnings from continuing
operations before income taxes, less income from equity method investments and capitalized interest, plus minority
interest expense, income distributions from equity method investments, amortization of capitalized interest and fixed
charges. Fixed charges include interest expense (including amortization of debt issuance costs), capitalized interest, loss
on sale of receivables and the portion of operating rental expense which management believes is representative of the
interest component of rent expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Predecessor’s earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by $52
million due principally to restructuring and asset impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter of 2001, and for the four
months ended June 27, 2003, our earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by $48 million due to charges related
to the Acquisition and application of purchase accounting.

(5) Marketable securities are included in Other Assets on our balance sheets as of the periods presented.

(6) Receivables include trade receivables and residual interests in receivables sold pursuant to the receivables facilities of
the Predecessor and the Successor.

(7) Total debt excludes any off balance sheet borrowings under our receivables facility.

(8) The Predecessor’s receivables facility was an off balance sheet arrangement. Our receivables facility can be treated as a
general financing agreement or as an off balance sheet arrangement depending on the level of loans to the borrower as
further described in ‘‘Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Off-balance
sheet arrangements’’ and ‘‘Description of other indebtedness—Receivables facility.’’

## Risk factors

_Investing in the notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks_
_described below, together with the other information in this listing memorandum, before you make a_
_decision to purchase any of the notes. If any of the events described in the risk factors below actually_
_occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially adversely_
_affected, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to repay the notes. In such case, you may_
_lose all or part of your original investment._

#### Risks related to our business

**Our available cash and access to additional capital may be limited by our substantial lever-**
**age.**

As a result of the Transactions, we are highly leveraged. As of June 27, 2003, we had total
consolidated indebtedness of approximately $3.5 billion with an additional $449 million of borrowings
available under our revolving credit facility, after giving effect to $51 million in outstanding letters of
credit. At June 27, 2003, we had no advances outstanding under the receivables facility. The
following chart shows our level of indebtedness and certain other information as of June 27, 2003 as
a result of the Transactions.

- On July 22, 2003, we refinanced $200 million of borrowings under the term loan A facility and all of the
borrowings under the term loan B facilities with the proceeds of new term loan C facilities, together with
approximately $46 million of cash. See ‘‘Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations—Liquidity and capital resources’’ and ‘‘Description of other indebtedness—Senior credit
facilities.’’

Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences for you, including the following:

   - It may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures,
product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other
purposes;

   - A substantial portion of our cash flows from operations must be dedicated to the payment of
principal and interest on our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes, including
our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;

23


-----

   - For the year ended December 31, 2001 (Predecessor) and the four months ended June 27,
2003 (Successor), earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by $52 million and $48
million, respectively. Such insufficiencies could occur in future periods and may adversely
impact our ability to cover all or a portion of our debt service requirements;

   - The debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us
to make payments on the notes;

   - Certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior credit facilities, are at
variable rates of interest, exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates;

   - It may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive
disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and

   - We may be more vulnerable than a less leveraged company to a downturn in general
economic conditions or in our business, or we may be unable to carry out capital spending
that is important to our growth.

**Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.**

The senior credit agreement and the indentures under which the notes will be issued will contain a
number of significant covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:

   - incur additional indebtedness or issue redeemable preferred stock;

   - pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock;

   - make investments;

   - enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries;

   - sell assets;

   - enter into transactions with our affiliates;

   - incur liens; and

   - engage in mergers or consolidations.

In addition, under the senior credit agreement, we are required to satisfy specified financial ratios and
tests. Our ability to comply with those provisions may be affected by events beyond our control, and
we may not be able to meet those ratios and tests. The breach of any of these covenants could
result in a default under the senior credit agreement and the lenders could elect to declare all
amounts borrowed under the senior credit agreement, together with accrued interest, to be due and
payable and could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. Borrowings under the
senior credit facilities are effectively senior in right of payment to both the senior notes and the senior
subordinated notes. Substantially all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets (other than
receivables sold to our receivables subsidiaries in connection with our receivables facility) and the
assets and a portion of the stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are pledged as collateral
pursuant to the terms of the senior credit agreement. If any of our indebtedness were to be
accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and the notes.

**Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt**
**service obligations to increase significantly.**

Certain of our borrowings, primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities, are at variable rates
of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations
on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the
same, and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness, including the notes,
would decrease.

**Our business would be materially and adversely affected if we lost any of our largest**
**customers.**

For the year ended December 31, 2002, approximately 20% of our sales were to Ford Motor
Company and its subsidiaries, approximately 18% of our sales were to DaimlerChrysler AG and its
subsidiaries, approximately 14% of our sales were to General Motors Corporation and its subsidiaries
and approximately 13% of our sales were to Volkswagen AG and its subsidiaries. Although business
with any given customer is typically split among numerous contracts, the loss of, or significant
reduction in purchases by, one or more of those major customers could materially and adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Our historical and pro forma financial information for the periods prior to the Transactions**
**may not be representative of our results as a separate company.**

Our historical and pro forma financial information included in this listing memorandum may not reflect
what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had we been a
separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented, or what our results of operations, financial
position and cash flows will be in the future. This is because:

   - we have made certain adjustments and allocations since TRW did not account for us as, and
we were not operated as, a single, stand-alone business for the periods presented; and

   - the information does not reflect certain changes that occurred in our operations as a result of
our separation from TRW.

Accordingly, our historical results of operations for the periods prior to the Transactions may not be
indicative of our future operating or financial performance. For additional information, see ‘‘Summary
historical and pro forma financial data,’’ ‘‘Unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated statements
of operations,’’ ‘‘Selected historical combined and consolidated financial data’’ and ‘‘Management’s
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.’’

**We may experience difficulties operating as a stand-alone company.**

Prior to the Acquisition, the Predecessor historically operated as part of TRW, and we may
experience difficulties operating as a stand-alone company. While TRW is contractually obligated to
provide us with certain transitional services, we cannot assure you that these services will be
sustained at the same level as when the Predecessor was a part of TRW or that we will obtain the
same benefits. Also, we cannot assure you that, after the expiration of these various arrangements,
we will be able to replace the transitional services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions,
including cost, as favorable as those we will receive from TRW. These arrangements were negotiated
in the overall context of the Acquisition.

**Blackstone controls us and may have conflicts of interest with us or you in the future.**

As a result of the Transactions, Blackstone beneficially owns approximately 78.5% of the outstanding
shares of common stock of TRW Automotive Holdings, our indirect parent. As a result, Blackstone
has control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and has the ability to prevent
any transaction that requires the approval of stockholders regardless of whether or not other
stockholders or noteholders believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For
example, Blackstone could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of indebtedness
that is secured or senior to the senior subordinated notes or sell revenue-generating assets,
impairing our ability to make payments under the notes. Additionally, Blackstone is in the business of
making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in
businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Blackstone may also pursue acquisition
opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us. So long as Blackstone continues to own a significant
amount of the outstanding shares of common stock of TRW Automotive Holdings, it will continue to
be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.

**We may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive automotive**
**parts industry.**

The automotive parts industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include independent suppliers of
parts, as well as suppliers formed by spin-offs from our existing VM customers, who are becoming
more aggressive in attempting to sell parts to other VMs. Depending on the particular product, the
number of our competitors varies significantly. We may not be able to continue to compete favorably
and increased competition in our markets may have a material adverse effect on our business.

**The cyclicality of automotive production and sales could adversely affect our business.**

Almost all of our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production
by our VM customers. Automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general
economic conditions and other factors, including consumer spending and preferences. In addition,
automotive production and sales can be affected by labor relations issues, regulatory requirements,
trade agreements and other factors. The volume of automotive production in North America, Europe
and the rest of the world has fluctuated, sometimes significantly, from year to year, and such
fluctuations give rise to fluctuations in the demand for our products. Any significant economic decline
that results in a reduction in automotive production and sales by our VM customers could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations.

**Continued pricing pressures on automotive suppliers may adversely affect our business.**

Pricing pressure from customers has been a characteristic of the automotive parts industry in recent
years. Virtually all VMs have policies of seeking price reductions each year. We have taken steps to
reduce costs and resist price reductions; however, price reductions have impacted our sales and
profit margins. If we are not able to offset continued price reductions through improved operating
efficiencies and reduced expenditures, those price reductions may have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations.

**If the United States dollar strengthens, our reported results of operations from our**
**international businesses will be reduced.**

In 2002, over 50% of our sales were originated outside the United States. In our combined and
consolidated financial statements, we translate our local currency financial results into United States
dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at
the end of that period. During times of a strengthening United States dollar, our reported international
sales and earnings will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer United States
dollars.

**We are subject to other risks associated with our non-U.S. operations.**

We have significant manufacturing operations outside the United States, including joint ventures and
other alliances. Risks are inherent in international operations, including:

   - exchange controls and currency restrictions;

   - currency fluctuations and devaluations;

   - changes in local economic conditions;

   - changes in laws and regulations;

   - exposure to possible expropriation or other government actions; and

   - unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against American interests.

These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty and recall**
**claims that may be brought against us.**

We may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or
allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in

26


-----

bodily injury and/or property damage. Accordingly, we could experience material warranty or product
liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims.

In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to
participate in a recall of that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to automotive safety.
Automotive suppliers like us are becoming more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and
are assuming more of the vehicle system design responsibility. As a result, VMs are increasingly
looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with product liability, warranty and recall claims.
Depending on the terms under which we supply products, a VM may hold us responsible for some or
all of the repair or replacement costs of these products under new vehicle warranties, when the
product supplied did not perform as represented. Our costs associated with providing product
warranties could be material. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition.

**We may be adversely affected by environmental and safety regulations or concerns.**

We are subject to the requirements of environmental and occupational safety and health laws and
regulations in the United States and other countries. We cannot assure you that we have been or will
be at all times in complete compliance with all of these requirements, or that we will not incur
material costs or liabilities in connection with these requirements in excess of amounts we have
reserved. In addition, these requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to
become more stringent over time. These requirements may change in the future in a manner that
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with
environmental requirements. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to pending litigation
raising various environmental and human health and safety claims, including certain asbestos-related
claims. While our costs to defend and settle these claims in the past have not been material, we
cannot assure you that this will remain so in the future. For more information about our
environmental compliance and potential environmental liabilities, see ‘‘Business—Environmental
matters’’ and ‘‘Business—Legal proceedings.’’

**Increasing costs for manufactured components and raw materials may adversely affect our**
**profitability.**

We use a broad range of manufactured components and raw materials in our products, including
castings, electronic components, finished sub-components, molded plastic parts, fabricated metal,
aluminum, steel, resins, leather and wood. It is generally difficult to pass increased prices for
manufactured components and raw materials through to our customers in the form of price increases.
Therefore, a significant increase in the price of these items could materially increase our operating
costs and materially and adversely affect our profit margins.

**Non-performance by our suppliers may adversely affect our operations.**

Because we purchase from suppliers various types of equipment and component parts, we may be
materially and adversely affected by the failure of those suppliers to perform as expected. This
non-performance may consist of delivery delays or failures caused by production issues or delivery of
non-conforming products. The risk of non-performance may also result from the insolvency or
bankruptcy of one or more of our suppliers. Our efforts to protect against and to minimize these risks
may not always be effective.

**Work stoppages at our customers’ facilities or at our facilities could adversely affect our**
**operations.**

Work stoppages occur relatively frequently in the automotive industry. If any of our customers
experience a material work stoppage, that customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products.
This could cause us to shut down production facilities relating to those products, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

27


-----

As of June 27, 2003, approximately 22% of our United States workforce and approximately 73% of
our hourly workforce outside of the United States were represented by 39 unions. It is likely that a
significant portion of our workforce will remain unionized for the foreseeable future. In the United
States, four of our union agreements, covering approximately 600 employees and representing 8% of
our hourly workforce in the U.S., expire in the next two years. We will engage in labor negotiations
with respect to seventy-six of our 146 non-U.S. locations during the next two years. Most of our
non-U.S. locations that are covered by labor agreements have agreements that are required to be
re-negotiated every two years, with the balance being covered by three-year agreements or four-year
agreements. While historically negotiations at our non-U.S. locations have rarely resulted in work
stoppages, we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate acceptable contracts with these
unions or that our failure to do so will not result in work stoppages. A work stoppage at one or more
of our plants may have a material adverse effect on our business.

**Our ability to operate our company effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain**
**key personnel.**

Our ability to operate our business and implement our strategies effectively depends, in part, on the
efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend
on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel, particularly
engineers and other employees with electronics and software expertise. The loss of the services of
any of our key employees or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

**We may be unable to successfully implement our business strategy.**

Our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors, many of
which are beyond our control. For example, we may not be successful in implementing our strategy if
unforeseen competing and/or alternative technologies emerge that render our technologies less
desirable or obsolete, customer markets for our new technologies do not develop as expected, or we
experience increased pressure on our margins. In addition, our ability to increase operating
efficiencies by moving to lower wage countries may lead to resource constraints at our joint ventures
and strategic alliances which could have a negative impact on their ability to meet customers’
demands in local markets, thereby adversely affecting our relationships with those customers
globally. As a result of such business or competitive factors, we may decide to alter or discontinue
aspects of our business strategy and may adopt alternative or additional strategies. Any failure to
successfully implement our business strategy could adversely affect our business, results of
operations and growth potential.

**Risks related to the notes**

**We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including**
**the notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebt-**
**edness, which may not be successful.**

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial
and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and
to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a
level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if
any, and interest on our indebtedness. See ‘‘Management’s discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations—Liquidity and capital resources.’’

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may
be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to
restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. These alternative measures may not
be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence
of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be

28


-----

required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other
obligations. The senior credit facilities and the indentures under which the notes have been issued
will restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from the sales. We may not be able to
consummate those sales or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these
proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. See ‘‘Description of
other indebtedness—Senior credit facilities,’’ ‘‘Description of senior notes’’ and ‘‘Description of senior
subordinated notes.’’

**We are a holding company with substantially all of our operations being conducted by our**
**subsidiaries. Our ability to repay our debt depends upon the performance of our subsidiaries**
**and their ability to make distributions to us.**

Substantially all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries and, therefore, our cash flow
and our ability to service our indebtedness, including our ability to pay the interest on and principal of
the notes when due, are dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our
subsidiaries. Any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries
could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law and
monetary transfer restrictions in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. In addition,
payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings.

Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, except for our subsidiary guarantors,
they will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the notes or to make
any funds available to pay those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payments.

**Your right to receive payments on each issue of notes is junior to those lenders who have a**
**security interest in our assets.**

Our obligations under the notes and our guarantors’ obligations under their guarantees of the notes
are unsecured, but our obligations under our senior credit facilities and each guarantor’s obligations
under their respective guarantees of the senior credit facilities are secured by a security interest in
substantially all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets (other than receivables sold to our
receivables subsidiaries in connection with our receivables facility) and the assets and a portion of
the stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. If we are declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if we
default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed
thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay
such indebtedness, the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of
the notes, even if an event of default exists under the indentures under which the notes have been
issued at such time. Furthermore, if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any
subsidiary guarantor under the notes, then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the
notes automatically and immediately upon such sale. In any such event, because the notes are not
secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors, it is possible that there
would be no assets remaining from which your claims could be satisfied or, if any assets remained,
they might be insufficient to satisfy your claims fully. Additionally, to the extent our subsidiaries sell
receivables pursuant to our receivables facility, payments made in respect of those interests will not
be available to make payments in respect of the notes. See ‘‘Description of other indebtedness.’’

As of June 27, 2003, as a result of the Transactions, we had approximately $1,520 million of senior
secured indebtedness (all of which is indebtedness under our senior credit facilities and which does
not include availability of approximately $449 million under the revolving credit facility, after giving
effect to $51 million in outstanding letters of credit), and our guarantors had approximately $7 million
of senior secured indebtedness (other than their guarantees of our indebtedness under the senior
credit facilities). The indentures permit the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness by us
and our restricted subsidiaries in the future, including secured indebtedness and issuance of
additional notes under the indentures. Additionally, as of June 27, 2003, our non-guarantor
receivables subsidiaries had no advances outstanding under our receivables facility.

29

**Claims of noteholders will be structurally subordinate to claims of creditors of our non-U.S.**
**subsidiaries (other than TRW Automotive Luxembourg) and our receivables subsidiaries**
**because they do not guarantee the notes.**

The notes are not guaranteed by any of our less than wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, non-U.S.
subsidiaries (other than TRW Automotive Luxembourg) or our receivables subsidiaries. Accordingly,
claims of holders of the notes are structurally subordinate to the claims of creditors of these
non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
claims of holders of the notes are also structurally subordinate to claims of the lenders under our
senior credit facilities to the extent of the guarantees by non-U.S. subsidiaries of the senior credit
facilities. All obligations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries will have to be satisfied before any of the
assets of such subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to us
or a guarantor of the notes.

As of June 27, 2003, as a result of the Transactions, our non-guarantor subsidiaries had total
indebtedness of approximately $232 million (excluding intercompany liabilities and guarantees of our
non-U.S. indebtedness under our senior credit facilities), representing approximately 7% of our total
indebtedness. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $6.4 billion, or 60%, of
our sales (excluding intercompany sales of approximately $426 million) and approximately
$370 million in net earnings (of our total net earnings of $164 million) for the year ended December
31, 2002 and approximately $1.2 billion, or 64%, of our sales (excluding intercompany sales of
approximately $61 million) and approximately $38 million in net earnings (of our total net earnings of
$31 million) for the two months ended February 28, 2003 and approximately $2.5 billion, or 65%, of
our sales (excluding intercompany sales of approximately $124 million) and approximately $5 million
in net earnings (of our total net loss of $51 million) for the four months ended June 27, 2003. In
addition, our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $5 billion, or 54%, of our assets
and approximately $2.7 billion, or 32%, of our liabilities (excluding net intercompany payables of
approximately $2.5 billion) as of June 27, 2003.

We also have joint ventures and subsidiaries in which we own less than 100% of the equity so that,
in addition to the structurally senior claims of creditors of those entities, the equity interests of our
joint venture partners or other shareholders in any dividend or other distribution made by these
entities would need to be satisfied on a proportionate basis with us. These joint ventures and less
than wholly-owned subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to distribute cash to
us in their financing or other agreements and, as a result, we may not be able to access their cash
flow to service our debt obligations, including in respect of the notes.

**Your right to receive payments on the senior subordinated notes are junior to all of our and**
**our guarantors’ senior indebtedness, including our and our guarantors’ obligations under the**
**senior notes and other existing and future senior debt.**

The senior subordinated notes are general unsecured obligations that are junior in right of payment
to all our existing and future senior indebtedness. The senior subordinated guarantees are general
unsecured obligations of the guarantors that are junior in right of payment to all of the applicable
guarantor’s existing and future senior indebtedness.

We and the guarantors may not pay principal, premium, if any, interest or other amounts on account
of the senior subordinated notes or the senior subordinated guarantees in the event of a payment
default or certain other defaults in respect of certain of our senior indebtedness, including debt under
the senior credit facilities and senior notes, unless the senior indebtedness has been paid in full or
the default has been cured or waived. In addition, in the event of certain other defaults with respect
to the exchange senior indebtedness, we or the guarantors may not be permitted to pay any amount
on account of the senior subordinated notes or the senior subordinated guarantees for a designated
period of time.

Because of the subordination provisions in the senior subordinated notes and the senior
subordinated guarantees, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of us or any
guarantor, our or the guarantor’s assets will not be available to pay obligations under the senior

30


-----

subordinated notes or the applicable senior subordinated guarantee until we or the guarantor has
made all payments on our or its senior indebtedness, respectively. We cannot assure you that
sufficient assets will remain after all these payments have been made to make any payments on the
senior subordinated notes or the applicable senior subordinated guarantee, including payments of
principal or interest when due.

As of June 27, 2003, as a result of the Transactions, we had approximately $2,848 million of senior
indebtedness, and our guarantors had approximately $7 million of senior indebtedness relating to
industrial revenue bonds and capital leases in addition to their guarantees of our borrowings under
the senior credit facilities and the senior notes. The senior subordinated note indenture will permit the
incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness, including senior debt, by us and our restricted
subsidiaries in the future. Additionally, to the extent our subsidiaries sell receivables in connection
with our receivables facility, payments made in respect of those interests will not be available to
make payments in respect of the senior subordinated notes. As of June 27, 2003, we had no
advances outstanding under our receivables facility.

**If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make**
**payments on the notes.**

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under our senior
credit facilities that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of
such indebtedness could make us unable to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the notes
and substantially decrease the market value of the notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash
flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal,
premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various
covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our
indebtedness (including our senior credit facilities), we could be in default under the terms of the
agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such
indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our revolving credit facility could elect to
terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings
against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating
performance declines, we may in the future need to seek to obtain waivers from the required lenders
under our senior credit facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our
senior credit facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required
lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could
exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. See
‘‘Description of other indebtedness—Senior credit facilities,’’ ‘‘Description of senior notes’’ and
‘‘Description of senior subordinated notes.’’

**We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control.**

Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to
repurchase all notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, unless such
notes have been previously called for redemption. We may not have sufficient financial resources to
purchase all of the notes that are tendered upon a change of control offer. The occurrence of a
change of control could also constitute an event of default under our senior credit facilities. Our bank
lenders may have the right to prohibit any such purchase or redemption, in which event we will seek
to obtain waivers from the required lenders under the senior credit facilities, but may not be able to
do so. See ‘‘Description of senior notes—Change of control’’ and ‘‘Description of senior subordinated
notes—Change of control.’’

**Despite our current leverage, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could**
**further exacerbate the risks described above.**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The
terms of the indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. Our revolving credit

31


-----

facility provides commitments of up to $500 million, $449 million of which were available for future
borrowings as of June 27, 2003, after giving effect to $51 million in outstanding letters of credit. Our
receivables facility provides for advances of up to $600 million, based on availability of eligible
receivables. As of June 27, 2003, we had no advances outstanding under our receivables facility. All
of those borrowings are secured, and as a result, effectively senior to the notes and the guarantees
of the notes by our subsidiary guarantors. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally
with the senior notes or senior subordinated notes, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share
ratably with the holders of the senior notes or the holders of the senior subordinated notes,
respectively, in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization,
dissolution or other winding-up of us. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds
paid to you. If new debt, including the issuance of additional notes under the indentures, is added to
our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.

**You may face foreign exchange risks or tax consequences by investing in the exchange euro**
**notes.**

A portion of each of the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes will be denominated and
payable in euros. If you are a U.S. investor, an investment in the euro notes will entail foreign
exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the
euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of economic, political and other factors over which we have
no control. Depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar could cause a decrease in the effective
yield of the euro notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you on a U.S.
dollar basis. Investing in the euro notes by U.S. investors may also have important tax
consequences. See ‘‘Certain United States federal income tax consequences—Consequences to
U.S. holders—Euro notes.’’

**Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court to void the notes and the guaran-**
**tees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.**

The issuance of the notes and the guarantees may be subject to review under federal and state
fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes. While the relevant laws may vary from state to state,
under such laws the payment of consideration will be a fraudulent conveyance if (1) we paid the
consideration with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (2) we or any of our
guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in
return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee, and, in the case of (2) only, one of the following is
also true:

   - we were or any of our guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the
incurrence of the indebtedness; or

   - payment of the consideration left us or any of our guarantors with an unreasonably small
amount of capital to carry on the business; or

   - we or any of our guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur debts beyond
our or its ability to pay as they mature.

Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair salable value of
all its assets; or

   - the present fair salable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required
to pay its probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities,
as they become absolute and mature; or

   - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

We believe that immediately after the issuance of the notes and the guarantees, we and each of the
guarantors will be solvent, will have sufficient capital to carry on our respective businesses and will

32


-----

be able to pay our respective debts as they mature. However, we cannot be certain as to the
standards a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would reach the same
conclusions with regard to these issues.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance,
the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or further
subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or
such guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the
notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may
not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event
of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt that could result in acceleration of such
debt.

If the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could also be subject to the claim that,
since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor,
the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration. A court
could thus void the obligations under the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s
other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes.

**There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes without registration under**
**applicable securities laws.**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under United States
and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United
States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the
United States and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your
investment for an indefinite period of time. We are obligated to use our reasonable best efforts to
commence offers to exchange the notes for equivalent notes registered under United States
securities laws or, in certain circumstances, register the reoffers and resales of the notes under
United States securities laws. See ‘‘Registration rights’’ and ‘‘Transfer restrictions.’’

**Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market,**
**and there is no assurance that any active trading market will develop for the notes.**

The notes are new issues of securities for which there is no established public market. We expect
the dollar notes and the euro notes to be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the dollar
notes to be eligible for trading by ‘‘qualified institutional buyers,’’ as defined under Rule 144A of the
Securities Act, in the PORTAL market. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to
make a market in the notes, and the exchange notes, if issued, as permitted by applicable laws and
regulations; however, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes or the
exchange notes, and they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice.
Therefore, we cannot assure you that an active market for the notes or the exchange notes will
develop or, if developed, that it will continue. Historically, the market for noninvestment grade debt
has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities
similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes or the exchange notes may experience similar
disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your
notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuances, the notes or the exchange notes may trade at
discounts from their initial offering prices, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for
similar notes, our financial and operating performance, whether additional notes are issued and other
factors.

## The Acquisition

_The following contains summaries of the material terms of certain agreements between Northrop_
_Grumman and affiliates of Blackstone that were entered into in contemplation of the Acquisition. The_
_descriptions of such agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by_
_reference to such agreements._

#### General
On November 18, 2002, Northrop Grumman and BCP Acquisition Company L.L.C., a Delaware
limited liability company and an affiliate of Blackstone, signed a master purchase agreement
providing for the acquisition by us of substantially all the assets and the assumption by us of
substantially all of the liabilities (other than certain indebtedness) associated with TRW’s automotive
business, for which we paid a purchase price of $4,443 million (excluding assumed debt of $210
million), subject to post-closing adjustments, of which $3,533 million was paid in cash at closing.
These assets and liabilities owned directly by TRW have been transferred to and assumed by one or
more newly-formed TRW entities (referred to as the ‘‘New Auto Entities’’) prior to the Acquisition. We
acquired 100% of the equity interests of the New Auto Entities and certain other subsidiaries of TRW
that held automotive assets and liabilities from TRW and its affiliates upon consummation of the
Acquisition. On December 20, 2002, after completion of the Merger, TRW and the former TRW
Automotive Inc. became signatories to the master purchase agreement.

In connection with the Acquisition, TRW Automotive Holdings received a cash equity contribution of
$698 million primarily from affiliates of Blackstone in exchange for shares of its common stock. Our
management group also contributed cash in exchange for shares of TRW Automotive Holdings’
common stock. TRW Automotive Holdings made a cash equity contribution of $698 million and
contributed newly issued shares of its common stock having an implied value of $170 million to TRW
Automotive Intermediate Holdings and thereby acquired all of the equity interests in it. TRW
Automotive Intermediate Holdings issued a $600 million face amount subordinated 8% pay-in-kind
note due 2018 to an affiliate of Northrop Grumman to acquire the stock of certain subsidiaries, and
contributed such stock together with a cash equity contribution of $698 million and the $170 million of
TRW Automotive Holdings common stock to our company, TRW Automotive, and thereby acquired all
of the equity interests in us. We used (1) the $698 million cash equity contribution, (2) borrowings
under our new senior secured term loan A facility, (3) borrowings under our new senior secured term
loan B facilities, (4) proceeds from the offering of the dollar senior notes and the outstanding euro
senior notes, (5) proceeds from the offering of the dollar senior subordinated notes and the euro
senior subordinated notes and (6) proceeds from sales by certain of our subsidiaries of receivables in
connection with our new receivables facility, to fund the cash portion of the purchase price and to
repay the $35 million promissory note issued by an affiliate of Blackstone to an affiliate of Northrop
Grumman to acquire one of the Korean subsidiaries of our predecessor company, and we used the
$170 million of TRW Automotive Holdings common stock to fund the stock portion of the purchase
price. The purchase price also included a short-term note payable to Northrop Grumman reflecting
estimated post-closing adjustments, subject to final negotiations. As described in ‘‘Use of proceeds,’’
we assumed $210 million of indebtedness of TRW’s automotive business, representing the
outstanding amount of £95 million of Lucas Varity senior notes that were assumed by TRW in
connection with its acquisition of Lucas Varity in 1999, plus accrued interest, and certain other
indebtedness. At the closing of the Acquisition, we also drew down $12 million of borrowings under
our new senior secured revolving credit facility. See ‘‘Use of proceeds,’’ ‘‘Capitalization’’ and
‘‘Description of other indebtedness.’’

As a result of the Acquisition, currently affiliates of Blackstone hold approximately 78.5%, an affiliate
of Northrop Grumman holds approximately 19.6% and our management group holds approximately
1.9% of the capital stock of TRW Automotive Holdings.

#### The master purchase agreement
The master purchase agreement contains customary seller representations and warranties of
Northrop Grumman, TRW and the former TRW Automotive Inc. and customary buyer representations
and warranties of BCP Acquisition Company L.L.C. and customary covenants and other agreements

34


-----

between Northrop Grumman, TRW and the former TRW Automotive Inc., on one hand, and BCP
Acquisition Company L.L.C. and its affiliates, on the other hand. In addition, the Acquisition was
conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions.

The master purchase agreement provides for indemnification for losses relating to specified events,
circumstances or matters. Northrop Grumman has agreed to indemnify TRW Automotive Holdings
from certain liabilities, including:

    - any losses or damages arising from the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty of Northrop Grumman, TRW or the former TRW Automotive Inc. contained in the
master purchase agreement or any of the ancillary agreements described below;

    - 50% of any environmental liabilities associated with the operation or ownership of TRW’s
automotive business on or prior to the Acquisition (subject to certain exceptions), regardless
of whether the liabilities arise before or after the Acquisition;

    - specified tax losses or liabilities, including, among others, those associated with TRW’s
automotive business relating to specified tax amounts due on or prior to the Acquisition; and

    - certain cash OPEB payments, in excess of (1) $48 million up to $57 million for 2003; (2)
$50 million up to $61 million for 2004; (3) $51 million up to $66 million for 2005; (4) $54
million up to $69 million for 2006; (5) $55 million up to $73 million for 2007; and (6) $56
million up to $74 million for 2008 and, unless an accelerated terminal value payment (as
described below) was previously made, a cash payment in 2008 equal to the product of (i)
the amount by which the OPEB payments made by us in 2008 exceeds $56 million, up to
$74 million, multiplied by (ii) 6.5. Northrop Grumman will pay us an accelerated terminal
value payment if a liquidity event occurs prior to 2008 equal to the product of (i) 6.5
multiplied by (ii) the amount by which our OPEB payments during the 12 months prior to the
liquidity event exceeds the projected cash cost for such period, not to exceed the maximum
payment for such period. A liquidity event is defined under the master purchase agreement
as the sale or other transfer of 10% or more of the shares of capital stock of TRW
Automotive Holdings held by Blackstone or any sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
Following an accelerated terminal value payment, Northrop Grumman will no longer be
required to make OPEB indemnification payments under the master purchase agreement.

The master purchase agreement provides that upon and following the occurrence of a registered
initial public offering of TRW Automotive Holdings’ equity securities, any payments otherwise payable
to TRW Automotive Holdings with respect to the OPEB indemnity will instead be paid to the
non-employee shareholders as of the closing of the Acquisition who remain shareholders as of the
date of such payment, in proportion to their beneficial ownership of the voting securities of TRW
Automotive Holdings as of such date of payment.

Northrop Grumman’s indemnification obligation with respect to breaches of representations and
warranties referred to above is subject to a $50 million deductible (other than losses from certain
specified matters not subject to the deductible) and to a $500 million cap (other than losses from
certain specified representations and warranties as to which this cap does not apply).

We are also required to indemnify Northrop Grumman, TRW and their respective affiliates from
liabilities arising from certain specified matters, including the inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of BCP Acquisition Company L.L.C., the liabilities designated as
‘‘Automotive Liabilities’’ under the master purchase agreement and specified tax losses or liabilities.

#### Ancillary agreements

In connection with the Acquisition, the parties have also entered into agreements governing certain
relationships between and among the parties after the closing of the Acquisition. These agreements
include two intellectual property license agreements, a transition services agreement, an employee
matters agreement, an insurance allocation agreement, a stockholders’ agreement and a transaction
and monitoring fee agreement. See ‘‘Certain relationships and related transactions’’ for descriptions
of these agreements.

## Use of proceeds

The proceeds received by us from the offering of notes, together with the borrowings under our new
senior credit facilities and the advances under our receivables facility, the cash equity contribution
made primarily by affiliates of Blackstone, the equity issued to an affiliate of Northrop Grumman, the
short term note payable to Northrop Grumman and the borrowings under the note issued to an
affiliate of Northrop Grumman by our direct parent, TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings, which
have been recorded by us as paid-in-capital at an amount based on the estimated fair value of $348
million, were used upon consummation of the Transactions to pay $4,443 million (excluding assumed
debt of $210 million), subject to post-closing adjustments, for the purchase of TRW’s automotive
business and to pay approximately $193 million in transaction fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions. The net proceeds received by us from the offering were
approximately $1,384 million after payment of transaction fees and expenses.

The following table sets forth the sources and uses of the funds for the Transactions consummated
on February 28, 2003. Information presented in the following table has been calculated using
exchange rates at February 28, 2003, as described below.

(1) The revolving credit facility provides for borrowings of up to $500 million. At the closing of the Acquisition, we drew down
$12 million from the revolving credit facility, which we repaid on March 4, 2003 with general corporate funds. At the
closing of the Acquisition, JPMorgan Chase Bank (the ‘‘escrow agent’’), acting for the benefit of management and
employees of TRW Automotive, subscribed for and purchased $12 million of shares of common stock of TRW Automotive
Holdings with the proceeds of a promissory note issued to TRW Automotive. On March 25, 2003, TRW Automotive
Holdings repurchased a portion of such shares from the escrow agent (and affiliates of Blackstone purchased the balance
of such shares from the escrow agent) and the note was repaid. On March 25, 2003, management and employees of
TRW Automotive subscribed for and purchased the number of shares of common stock of TRW Automotive Holdings
repurchased by TRW Automotive Holdings from the escrow agent.

(2) Short-term note payable to Northrop Grumman reflecting certain estimated post-closing working capital adjustments,
subject to final negotiations.

(3) On July 22, 2003, we refinanced $200 million of the borrowings under the term loan A facility and all of the borrowings
under the term loan B facilities with the proceeds of new term loan C facilities, together with approximately $46 million of
cash, in order to reduce our interest expense. See ‘‘Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations—Liquidity and capital resources’’ and ‘‘Description of other indebtedness—Senior credit facilities.’’

(4) Approximate U.S. dollar equivalent of the dollar and euro borrowings under the term loan B facilities, based on an
exchange rate at February 28, 2003 of $1.0821= t1.00.

36


-----

(5) The receivables facility provides for advances of up to $600 million, based on availability of eligible receivables. Because
advances under the receivables facility depend on the availability of eligible receivables, the amount available for
advances under such facility fluctuates over time. See ‘‘Description of other indebtedness—Receivables facility.’’

(6) Approximate U.S. dollar equivalent of the euro senior notes, based on an exchange rate at February 28, 2003 of
$1.0821= t1.00.

(7) Approximate U.S. dollar equivalent of the euro senior subordinated notes, based on an exchange rate at February 28,
2003 of $1.0821= t1.00.

(8) Reflects the outstanding amount of £95 million Lucas Varity senior notes that were assumed by TRW in connection with
the acquisition of Lucas Varity in 1999, plus accrued interest, based on an exchange rate at February 28, 2003 of
$1.5782 = £1.00 and certain other indebtedness, which have been assumed by us as part of the Acquisition.

(9) Equity consists of (a) a cash equity contribution of $698 million primarily from affiliates of Blackstone to our indirect
parent, TRW Automotive Holdings, which has been contributed to TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings and, in turn, to
us, (b) $170 million of newly issued shares of TRW Automotive Holdings common stock, which has been contributed to
TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings and, in turn, to us and (c) the full face amount of the $600 million subordinated
note issued by TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings to an affiliate of Northrop Grumman to acquire the stock of certain
subsidiaries. This stock has been contributed to us and recorded by us as paid-in-capital at an amount based on the
estimated $348 million fair value of the note calculated by applying a 12% discount rate over the expected 15 year life of
the note. See ‘‘Certain relationships and related transactions—Northrop Grumman subordinated note’’.

(10) Purchase price (excluding assumed debt) consisted of (a) $3,533 million of cash paid at closing, (b) the short-term note
payable to Northrop Grumman reflecting certain estimated post-closing adjustments, subject to final negotiations, (c) $170
million of newly issued shares of TRW Automotive Holdings common stock, (d) the full face amount of the $600 million
subordinated note to be issued by TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings to an affiliate of Northrop Grumman and (e)
the $35 million promissory note issued by an affiliate of Blackstone to an affiliate of Northrop Grumman to acquire one of
the Korean subsidiaries of our predecessor company in the Acquisition. This promissory note was repaid in full shortly
after the closing of the Acquisition.

(11) Reflects cash proceeds available to us for general working capital requirements subsequent to the completion of the
Transactions.

and certain other indebtedness, which have been assumed by us as part of the Acquisition.

## Unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated statements of operations

The following unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated statements of operations are based
on the audited combined financial statements of our predecessor company and our unaudited
consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this listing memorandum as adjusted to
illustrate the estimated pro forma effects of the Transactions. The historical financial statements of
our predecessor company do not include any purchase accounting adjustments related to the
Merger. The unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated statements of operations should be
read in conjunction with the combined financial statements of our predecessor company, our
consolidated financial statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this listing
memorandum, including ‘‘Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations.’’

The unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated statements of operations data give effect to the
Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1 of each period presented.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions
that we believe are reasonable. We have allocated the total purchase price to the assets and
liabilities of our predecessor company based on preliminary estimates of their fair values, based on
work performed to date by independent valuation specialists assisting us in determining the fair value
of a significant portion of these assets and liabilities, including property, plant and equipment, retiree
benefits assets and liabilities and intangible assets.

The amounts that we may record based on our final assessment and determination of fair values
may differ from the information presented in this unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated
statements of operations. Amounts allocated to net tangible assets and intangible assets may be
revised, and depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives may differ from the assumptions
we used in this unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated statements of operations, any of
which could result in a change in depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, there could be
further adjustments necessary to conform our predecessor company’s historical accounting policies to
ours. See note 2 to the unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements.

The unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated statements of operations data do not reflect any
one-time charges that we have recorded following the closing of the Transactions. These one-time
charges include: a non-cash charge for the manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase
accounting which has been charged to cost of sales as this inventory was sold; the one-time costs
related to the set up of our off balance sheet receivables facility and the unused bridge commitment
fees which have been charged to expense immediately upon the closing of the Transactions; the net
interest expense incurred on the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes during the period
they were held in escrow prior to the closing of the Transactions; and the immediate write-off of
purchased in-process research and development.

The unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated statements of operations are for informational
purposes only and are not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of
operations or financial position that we would have reported had the Transactions been completed as
of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of our future consolidated results
of operations or financial position.

(1) Reflects the estimated increase to pension and other postretirement benefits (‘‘OPEB’’) income, net resulting from
the elimination of amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses, prior service costs and transition obligations and
assets. The valuation of employee benefit obligations is based on the estimated asset split of the former TRW
U.S. salaried plan assumed by us at the closing of the Acquisition. The final asset split could differ from the
preliminary allocation. Therefore, the amount ultimately allocated to pensions may differ.

(2) The pro forma statements of operations reflect the elimination of the effect of a $42 million inventory write-up
recorded as a result of the Acquisition. Total inventory write-up related to the Acquisition is $43 million. The
remaining $1 million will be recorded in future quarters.

(3) Reflects the net decrease in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from fair value adjustments to fixed
assets and certain intangible assets.

(1) Represents the amount of corporate expenses that TRW or Northrop Grumman corporate allocated to us on a
historical basis as a segment of TRW or Northrop Grumman for finance, information systems, legal, human
resource administration, insurance and other corporate functions.

(2) Represents our estimate of the costs to operate on a stand-alone basis. We derived these amounts by analyzing
the services provided to the Predecessor by TRW or Northrop Grumman corporate and our 2002 functional cost
center budgets.

(3) Represents an annual monitoring fee we and our subsidiaries will pay to an affiliate of Blackstone.

(4) Represents the additional allocation of corporate costs above the amount historically allocated to the Predecessor
as a segment of TRW that we were required to record by the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 1B in
preparing carve-out financial statements for our predecessor company. This additional allocation was based upon
an internal allocation methodology that was developed for a proposed spin-off transaction that did not occur. The
total of the segment and the additional corporate allocations is not necessarily representative of the operating
expenses that we would have incurred had we operated on a stand-alone basis.

(1) Reflects interest expense on the revolving credit facility using an assumed average outstanding balance of $112
million and an effective interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.50%.

(2) Reflects interest expense on the term loan A facility using an assumed initial outstanding balance of $410 million
and an effective interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.50%.

(3) Reflects interest expense on the term loan B facilities using an assumed initial outstanding balance of $1.10 billion,
based on an exchange rate at February 28, 2003 of $1.0821 = t1.00, and an effective interest rate of LIBOR plus
4.00%. On July 22, 2003, we refinanced $200 million of the borrowings under the term loan A facility and all of the
borrowings under the term loan B facilities with the proceeds of the new term loan C facilities, together with
approximately $46 million of cash, in order to reduce our interest expense. See ‘‘Management’s discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Liquidity and capital resources’’ and ‘‘Description of other
indebtedness—Senior credit facilities.’’

(4) Reflects interest expense on $925 million of dollar senior notes using an interest rate of 9.375% and $217 million
of outstanding euro senior notes, based on an exchange rate at February 28, 2003 of $1.0821 = t1.00 and using
an interest rate of 10.125%.

(5) Reflects interest expense on $300 million of dollar senior subordinated notes using an interest rate of 11.0% and
$135 million of euro senior subordinated notes, based on an exchange rate at February 28, 2003 of $1.0821 =
t1.00 and using an interest rate of 11.75%.

(6) Reflects interest expense on the £95 million Lucas Varity senior notes using an assumed outstanding balance of
$149 million, based on an exchange rate at February 28, 2003 of $1.5782 = £1.00 and a fixed interest rate of
10.875%, the short term note payable to Northrop Grumman at LIBOR and other assumed debt of approximately
$50 million at an average interest rate of 8.532%.

(7) Reflects commitment fees of 0.75% on the assumed $288 million average undrawn balance under the revolving
credit facility. The commitment fee is 0.75% but will be reduced to 0.50% during the period (a) in which borrowings
under the revolving credit facility exceed 50% of total revolving credit facility commitments or (b) that we maintain a
total leverage ratio of less than 3.25 to 1.00.

(8) Reflects non-cash amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs over the term of the related facility (6 years for
the revolving credit facility and term loan A facility, 8 years for term loan B facilities and 10 years for the senior

notes and the senior subordinated notes) and does not include $29 million of one-time costs related to the set up
of the receivables facility and the bridge financing commitment fees that were expensed at the closing of the
Transactions.

(9) Pro forma interest expense for the four months ended June 27, 2003 represents actual interest expense applicable
to each debt instrument excluding $5 million of non-recurring net interest expense that was incurred on the senior
notes and the senior subordinated notes during the period they were held in escrow prior to the closing of the
Transactions and the unused bridge commitment fees of $11 million which have been charged to expense
immediately upon the closing of the Transactions.

A 1/8% change in interest rates would have the following effect on interest expense:

Net adjustment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 3 $1 $(16)

(1) Reflects pro forma loss on sale of receivables under our receivables facility using an assumed average outstanding
balance of $250 million and an assumed cost of LIBOR plus 2.5% (to cover cost of funding, commitment fees and
credit default swaps). Availability under the receivables facility is limited by the amount of our eligible receivables,
as defined, and other customary factors.

(2) Results for the six months ended June 27, 2003 include $18 million one-time fees related to the establishment of
the receivables facility.

A 1/8% change in LIBOR rates would change loss on sale of receivables by $0.3 million for the
twelve month period and $0.1 million for the six month periods.

Currently, our receivables facility is funded through commercial paper conduits. However, this
may not always be the case. Our actual loss on sale of receivables will depend on whether we
fund through commercial paper conduits.

� If we fund through the commercial paper conduits, our cost will be based on amounts
funded at the commercial paper conduits’ quoted cost of funds for issuing commercial
paper on a matched or pool-funded basis plus a usage fee.

� If we do not fund through the commercial paper conduits (but directly through conduit
sponsors), our costs will be at our then-current revolving credit facility spread plus either
(1) the LIBOR rate, adjusted for statutory reserves or (2) the higher of JPMorgan Chase
Bank’s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%.

In addition, we will pay a commitment fee based on the unfunded balance of the receivables
facility and may incur costs related to credit default swaps.

Our pro forma loss on sale of receivables under the funding assumptions described above,
including commitment fees but excluding the cost of any credit default swaps, would be as
follows:


**Six months**
**ended June 28,**
**2002**


**Six months**

Funding through commercial paper conduits . . . $10 $5 $9
Funding directly through conduit sponsors
(assumed to be LIBOR plus 3.50%) . . . . . . . . 12 6 6

The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently issued its Interpretation No. 46, which may
affect the way in which sponsors account for their commercial paper conduits. This
interpretation is effective immediately for new arrangements entered into after January 31, 2003
and for quarterly periods beginning after June 15, 2003 for older arrangements. Changes in
accounting, if any, required of the conduit sponsors could result in increased regulatory capital
or other costs for the sponsors of funding in the commercial paper conduit. We have agreed to
reimburse the sponsors for these increased costs, up to an agreed upon maximum amount
such that our total funding costs will not exceed the cost of funding directly through conduit
sponsors. It is also possible that as a result of these accounting changes one or more of the
commercial paper conduit lenders may elect to discontinue funding, requiring our receivables
subsidiaries to finance a portion of the receivables facility directly with the conduit sponsors at
the rates described above. Consequently, the receivables facility could become more expensive
to us.

(h) Reflects the elimination of the gain on the repurchase of £5.4 million of Lucas Varity senior
notes in the first quarter of 2002. The gain was reclassified from ‘‘extraordinary items’’ to
‘‘earnings before income taxes’’ pursuant to SFAS 145 as of January 1, 2003.

(j) Reflects the pro forma tax effect of the above adjustments at the applicable tax rate.

## Selected historical combined and consolidated financial data

The selected historical combined financial data of the Predecessor as of December 31, 2000, 2001
and 2002 and for each of the four years in the period ended December 31, 2002 have been derived
from the audited combined financial statements of our predecessor company. The selected historical
combined financial data of the Predecessor as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, for the year ended
December 31, 1998 and for the six months ended June 28, 2002 and for the four months ended
June 27, 2003 have been derived from the unaudited combined financial statements of our
predecessor company, which, in each case, have been prepared on a basis consistent with the
Predecessor’s audited annual combined financial statements. The selected historical consolidated
financial data of the Successor as of June 27, 2003 and for the four months ended June 27, 2003
have been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements and have been prepared on
a different basis from the Predecessor’s annual combined financial statements under the purchase
method of accounting as a result of the consummation of the Acquisition on February 28, 2003. In
the opinion of management, such unaudited financial data reflects all adjustments, consisting only of
normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for those periods.
The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the full year or any future period. The combined financial statements of the Predecessor
as of December 31, 2001 and 2002, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2002 and for the six-month period ended June 28, 2002 and for the two month period ended
February 28, 2003 and the consolidated financial statements of the Successor as of and for the
four-month period ended June 27, 2003 are included elsewhere in this listing memorandum.

Comparisons of certain items below are affected by the acquisition of Lucas Varity in March 1999
and divestitures during the three-year period ended December 31, 2001. The table should be read in
conjunction with ‘‘Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations’’ and the combined financial statements of our predecessor company and our consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this listing memorandum. The following financial
information for the periods prior to the Transactions may not reflect what our results of operations,
financial position and cash flows would have been had we operated as a separate, stand-alone entity
during the periods presented, or what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows will
be in the future.

(1) Certain supplemental financial data for 1998 is not available.

(2) Represents the fair value of the purchased in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of Lucas
Varity in March 1999 and the Acquisition. Under GAAP, the purchase price allocation includes the fair value of purchased
in-process research and development, which is immediately expensed to the extent it has not reached technological
feasibility or has no future alternative use.

(3) Includes miscellaneous income and expense items from operations. See note 9 to the combined financial statements and
note 8 to the unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements for further details.

(4) EBITDA, a measure used by management to measure performance, is reconciled to net earnings (losses) in the following
table. Our management believes EBITDA is useful to the investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts,
investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. EBITDA is not a recognized term
under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to net earnings (losses) as an indicator of operating performance
or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Because not all companies use identical calculations,
this presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additionally,
EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not consider
certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. The amounts shown
for EBITDA as presented herein differ from the amounts calculated under the definition of EBITDA used in our debt
instruments. The definition of EBITDA used in our debt instruments is further adjusted for certain cash and non-cash
charges and is used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such
as incurring additional debt and making certain payments.

memorandum. While we continuously evaluate whether additional restructuring opportunities exist to increase our
operating efficiencies, we do not have any current plans that would result in additional restructuring charges of the
magnitude we incurred in 1999, 2000 and 2001.

(6) For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings represents earnings from continuing
operations before income taxes, less income from equity method investments and capitalized interest plus minority
interest expense, income distributions from equity method investments, amortization of capitalized interest and fixed
charges. Fixed charges include interest expense (including amortization of debt issuance costs), capitalized interest, loss
on sale of receivables and the portion of operating rental expense which management believes is representative of the
interest component of rent expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Predecessor’s earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by $52
million due principally to restructuring and asset impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter of 2001, and for the four
months ended June 27, 2003, our earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by $48 million due to charges related
to the Acquisition and application of purchase accounting.

(7) Receivables include trade receivables and residual interests in receivables sold pursuant to the off balance sheet
receivables facilities of the Predecessor and the Successor.

(8) Total debt excludes any off balance sheet borrowings under our receivables facility.

(9) The Predecessor’s receivables facility was an off balance sheet arrangement. Our receivables facility can be treated as a
general financing agreement or as an off balance sheet arrangement depending on the level of loans to the borrower as
further described in ‘‘Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Off-balance
sheet arrangements’’ and ‘‘Description of other indebtedness—Receivables facility.’’

## Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

_The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations covers_
_periods prior and subsequent to the Transactions. Accordingly, the discussion and analysis of_
_historical operations of the Predecessor during the periods prior to the consummation of the_
_Transactions do not reflect the significant impact that the Transactions will have on us. In addition,_
_the statements in the discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding_
_the performance of our business and the other non-historical statements in the discussion and_
_analysis are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous_
_risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in the ‘‘Risk_
_factors’’ section. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any_
_forward-looking statements. You should read the following discussion together with the sections_
_entitled ‘‘Risk factors,’’ ‘‘Unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated statements of operations,’’_
_‘‘Selected historical combined and consolidated financial data’’ and the historical combined financial_
_statements of our predecessor and our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this_
_listing memorandum._

#### Basis of presentation

The Predecessor did not historically operate as a stand-alone business, but as part of TRW, which
became a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman on December 11, 2002. Prior to the completion of the
Acquisition, TRW contributed substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its automotive business
owned directly by TRW (other than certain indebtedness) to one or more newly-formed entities, which
have been acquired by us in the Acquisition. We acquired 100% of the equity interests of such newly
formed entities and certain other subsidiaries of TRW that held automotive assets and liabilities from
TRW and its affiliates upon consummation of the Acquisition.

Due to a change in ownership, and the resultant application of purchase accounting, the historical
financial statements of the Predecessor and the Successor included in this listing memorandum have
been prepared on different bases for the periods presented and are not comparable.

The following provides a description of the basis of presentation during all periods presented:

**_Successor – Represents our consolidated financial position as of June 27, 2003 and our_**
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the four month period ended June 27, 2003
following the Acquisition. The financial position as of June 27, 2003 and results of operations and
cash flows for the four month period ended June 27, 2003 reflect the preliminary application of
purchase accounting, described below, relating to the Acquisition.

**_Predecessor – Represents the combined financial position of the automotive business of TRW for all_**
periods prior to the Acquisition on February 28, 2003. This presentation is on the historical basis of
accounting without the application of purchase accounting related to the Merger.

The combined financial statements of the Predecessor for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2002 and the unaudited pro forma information included in the results of
operations for the six months ended June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002 are based on the historical
assets, liabilities, sales and expenses of the Predecessor for the periods prior to the Acquisition,
including the allocation of a portion of TRW’s general and administrative corporate expenses, debt,
interest expense and income taxes for periods prior to March 1, 2003 and the historical assets,
liabilities, sales and expenses of the Successor for the four month period ended June 27, 2003. The
pro forma adjustments reflect the effect of the Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1 of each
period.

The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Successor exclude, while those of
the Predecessor include, for all periods presented, the assets, liabilities, results of operations and
cash flows of the joint venture, TKS, which was not transferred to us as part of the Acquisition.

As a result, the historical and other financial information of the Predecessor included in this listing
memorandum may not reflect what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would
have been had we operated as a separate, stand-alone company for the periods presented.

#### Company overview

We are among the world’s largest and most diversified suppliers of automotive systems, modules and
components to global VMs and related aftermarkets. We operate our business along three operating
segments: Chassis Systems, Occupant Safety Systems and Other Automotive. Our cost of sales
consists of variable and fixed components. Our variable and fixed costs approximate 83% and 17%
of cost of sales, respectively. Variable costs are proportional to volume and mix and consist
principally of materials and labor to manufacture our products. Our fixed costs are not significantly
influenced by production volume, in the short term, and consist principally of administrative salaries,
benefits and depreciation and other facility-related costs.

Our business is moderately seasonal because our largest North American customers typically halt
operations for approximately two weeks in July and one week in December. Additionally, customers in
Europe historically shut down vehicle production during a portion of August. Third quarter automotive
production traditionally is also lower as new models enter production. Accordingly, our third and fourth
quarter sales tend to be lower than our first and second quarter sales.

Contract durations for automotive parts generally range from one year to the entire life of the vehicle
model, generally three to seven years for cars and four to ten years for light trucks. Tier-1 suppliers
generally compete for new VM business at the beginning of the development of new vehicle models
and upon the redesign of existing vehicle models. New vehicle model development generally begins
at least two to five years before the marketing of such models to consumers. As a result, a significant
portion of a supplier’s annual sales are generated pursuant to arrangements begun about two to five
years before the revenues related to the arrangements begin to be realized. The Tier-1 sourcing
process for vehicle programs, which varies according to VM, is typically initiated when a VM seeks
requests for quotations from several suppliers at least three to six years before anticipated vehicle
production. Based on these quotations, VMs in many cases then select and work with a supplier on
specific component design and development projects related to the new vehicle program. At varying
points during this process, VMs may issue ‘‘nomination letters,’’ letters of intent or other
representations to the supplier that, based on the supplier’s quotation and subject to a number of
conditions established by the VM, the VM intends to award specific business relating to the vehicle
program to the supplier. By the time the design and development of the vehicle program is nearly
complete, the VM will typically have evaluated the supplier’s performance to date and its ability to
meet the VM’s specific production and service requirements. The VM will then develop a proposed
production timetable, including current vehicle volume and option mix estimates based on its own
assumptions, and then source business with the supplier pursuant to written contracts, purchase
orders or other firm commitments, provided that the supplier can meet the VM’s designated
conditions and remain competitive in terms of price, quality, technology and delivery. In general,
these contracts, purchase orders and commitments provide that the VM can terminate for
convenience, and in some cases, they provide that the price will decrease over the proposed
production timetable. Awarded business generally covers the supply of all or a portion of a VM’s
production and service requirements of a particular product program rather than the supply of a
specific quantity of products. Accordingly, in estimating awarded business over the life of a contract
or other commitment, a supplier must make various assumptions as to the estimated number of
vehicles expected to be produced, the timing of that production, the mix of options on the vehicles
produced and pricing of the products being supplied. The realization of sales based on awarded
business is subject in all cases to a number of important risks and uncertainties. In addition, the
actual production volumes and option mix of vehicles produced by VMs depend on a number of
factors that are beyond a supplier’s control.

#### Automotive environment

Our business is greatly affected by the automotive build rates in North America and Europe. The
automobile industry is characterized by short-term volatility, but long-term growth of light vehicle sales

53


-----

and production. New vehicle demand is driven by macro-economic and other factors such as
interest-rates, manufacturer and dealer sales incentives, fuel prices, consumer confidence and
employment and income growth trends. These factors ultimately determine longer-term vehicle
production and sales rates. See ‘‘Industry overview—Automobile and light truck markets.’’

One of the current trends in the automotive industry is for VMs to shift research and development,
design and testing responsibility to suppliers. VMs have also been reducing the number of their
suppliers, preferring strong relationships with fewer suppliers. We operate in a difficult pricing
environment and our goal is to mitigate the pricing pressure imposed by VMs by continuing cost
reduction efforts and restructuring our business. In 2001, we positioned our business for improved
competitiveness by consolidating our businesses, engaging in supply chain management and
streamlining our management structure. In addition, we began to implement Six Sigma, a leading
quality improvement program, throughout our operations and functions during 2001.

#### Acquisitions and divestitures

In 2000 and 2001, the Predecessor disposed of 15 non-core businesses, four of which were
accounted for as discontinued operations and 11 of which were not accounted for as discontinued
operations. The principal businesses included in discontinued operations were Lucas Varity’s diesel
and wiring businesses. Proceeds from the sales of the discontinued operations were $853 million and
$29 million in 2000 and 2001, respectively. There were no gains or losses on the sales of former
Lucas Varity businesses in 2000 because the businesses had been recorded at fair value under
purchase accounting in connection with the purchase of such businesses from Lucas Varity. In 2001,
the Predecessor recorded a $10 million gain on the sale of discontinued operations which is included
in the net results of discontinued operations.

The most significant of the 11 businesses divested that were not accounted for as discontinued
operations were Lucas Varity India electrical businesses, certain sensor and related components
businesses, Man Machine Interface and TRW’s Nelson Stud Welding business. The revenues of
these businesses were included in sales of the combined statements of operations and were $273
million and $69 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Proceeds
from the sales of these divested businesses were $258 million and $17 million for 2000 and 2001,
respectively. The gain on the sales of these businesses was $21 million and $18 million, respectively,
for the same periods.

On April 8, 2003, we sold our 21.8% equity interest in TOYODA TRW Automotive, Inc. (‘‘Toyoda’’) to
our joint venture partner, Toyoda Machine Works, Ltd. We had previously accounted for our interest
in Toyoda under the equity method, and classified this investment in ‘‘Other assets’’ (long-term) in our
combined and consolidated balance sheets.

On June 27, 2003, we sold our 60% partnership interest in Quality Safety Systems Company
(‘‘QSS’’), a Canadian seat belt joint venture, to a subsidiary of our partner, Tokai Rika Co., Ltd.
Through the sale date, QSS’s financial position and results of operations were included in our
consolidated and combined financial statements. Proceeds from the Toyoda and QSS sales
aggregated approximately $ 31 million, net of cash retained in the QSS business.

On June 26, 2003, we acquired sole ownership of the immediate parent of Autocruise, S.A.
(‘‘Autocruise’’) by acquiring for normal consideration the equity interest held by our former joint
venture partner, Thales Group. Autocruise, operating a custom-built facility in Brest, France, designs
and manufactures radar-based adaptive cruise control systems, principally sold in certain European
markets.

#### Restructuring

Since 2000, the Predecessor has taken several restructuring and other actions to reduce overhead
costs and increase operating efficiency by reorganizing and downsizing its operations and shifting
production capacity from high wage areas to low wage areas. In 2000, the Predecessor recorded
charges of $85 million for actions that resulted in employee reductions of approximately 3,700, the

54


-----

closing of two plants and the reorganization and downsizing of its aftermarket business. In 2001, the
Predecessor recorded charges of $213 million related to the closing of two facilities and various
headcount reduction activities including the integration of the former Chassis, Occupant Safety
Systems and Automotive Electronics segments under one management team. The combination of
these activities in 2001 were expected to result in a reduction of approximately 6,100 employees, of
which approximately 6,000 were terminated as of June 27, 2003. In 2002, the Predecessor recorded
charges of $59 million for actions that resulted in the closing of three plants and expected employee
reductions of approximately 1,100. Approximately 928 employees were terminated as a result of
these actions as of June 27, 2003. During the six months ended June 28, 2002, the Predecessor
recorded charges of $9 million before tax primarily for severance costs and the closing of one
manufacturing facility. During the two months ended February 28, 2003, the Predecessor recorded
charges of $3 million for severance and costs related to the consolidation of certain facilities.

In connection with the Acquisition, we assumed liabilities (subject to certain exceptions) totaling
approximately $51 million for various restructuring activities, primarily related to involuntary severance
obligations and costs to exit certain activities. For the four months ended June 27, 2003, we recorded
charges of $3 million for severance and costs related to the consolidation of certain facilities.
Additionally, we recorded a $37 million reserve primarily for severance related to strategic
restructurings, plant closings and involuntary employee termination arrangements outside of the
United States to be paid over the next several years in accordance with local laws. The charges
described above include both cash and non-cash items. For the periods ended December 31, 2000,
2001 and 2002, the cash charges were $77 million, $189 million and $27 million, respectively, and
the non-cash charges were $8 million, $24 million and $32 million, respectively. For the six months
ended June 28, 2002, the cash charges were $7 million and the non-cash charges were $2 million.
For the two months ended February 28, 2003, and the four months ended June 27, 2003, only cash
charges were recorded totaling $3 million and $3 million, respectively.

In addition to the restructuring charges described above, in 2000, the Predecessor initiated
restructuring actions to dispose of several nonstrategic or inefficient facilities, discontinue production
of low-margin products and relocate certain facilities related to the integration of the Lucas Varity
automotive businesses. These actions were recorded through purchase price allocation of Lucas
Varity in the amount of $18 million and thus are not included in the combined statement of operations
for 2000. All applicable payments have been made under this program, and there is no remaining
reserve as of June 27, 2003. While we continuously evaluate whether additional restructuring
opportunities exist to increase our operating efficiencies, we do not have any current plans that would
result in additional restructuring charges of the magnitude that the Predecessor incurred in 2000,
2001 and 2002.

The following table sets forth a summary of the activity in the balance sheet accounts related to the
restructuring reserves:

**Provision**


**Beginning** **Administrative** **Cost of**
**(Dollars in millions)** **balance** **and selling** **sales**


**Used for**
**purposes** **Ending**
**intended** **balance**


Four months ended June 27, 2003 . . . $ 51 $ 3 $ — $37 $ (11) $ 80
Two months ended February 28,
2003 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 61 1 2 — (13) 51
Six months ended June 28, 2002 145 — 9 — (51) 103
Year ended December 31, 2002 . . . . . 145 17 42 — (143) 61
Year ended December 31, 2001 . . . . . 63 87 126 — (131) 145
Year ended December 31, 2000 . . . . . 48 42 43 18 (88) 63

Of the $80 million restructuring reserve accrued at June 27, 2003, approximately $34 million is expected to be paid through
2004, and approximately $27 million relates to involuntary employee termination arrangements outside the United States to be
paid over the next several years in accordance with local law.

#### Asset impairments other than restructuring

In 2000, as a result of a plan to consolidate two of our Mesa air bag manufacturing facilities into one,
the Predecessor recorded an asset impairment charge of $52 million in cost of sales. The
Predecessor completed the consolidation plan during the first half of 2002. Property, plant and
equipment were written down to fair value on the basis of discounted estimated future cash flows and
future salvage values. Additionally in 2000, the Other Automotive segment recorded an asset
impairment charge of $15 million in cost of sales as a result of a reduction of volume at one site that
allowed the Predecessor to consolidate production. Assets were written down to fair value based
upon current market values of the assets. In 2001, asset impairment charges of $28 million, $10
million and $12 million were recorded by Chassis Systems, Occupant Safety Systems and Other
Automotive segments, respectively. These charges, related primarily to the write-down of property,
plant and equipment, were recorded as $38 million in cost of sales, $11 million in other (income)
expense-net and $1 million in goodwill amortization. Of these charges, $49 million was a result of the
reduction of volume, consolidation of production and outsourcing at certain facilities. In 2002,
Occupant Safety Systems and Other Automotive segments recorded asset impairment charges of
$11 million and $6 million, respectively. Of these charges, $10 million related to the write-down of the
investment in two affiliates to fair market value. The remaining $7 million related primarily to the
write-down of property, plant and equipment to fair value. Of these charges, $9 million was recorded
in other income-net, $7 million in cost of sales and $1 million in amortization of intangible assets.

#### Pension plans

During the periods presented, substantially all our employees participated in defined benefit pension
plans or retirement/termination indemnity plans. Net pension income included in earnings from
continuing operations of the Predecessor for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002
and the two months ended February 28, 2003 was $205 million, $209 million, $222 million and $23
million, respectively. Generally, pension income is required to be retained by the applicable pension
plan and is not available for general corporate use. The net pension income during these periods is
principally due to the over funded status of the U.K. defined benefit plan. The fair value of plan
assets in excess of the projected benefit obligation for the U.K. plan was $2.4 billion, $1.8 billion,
$1.2 billion and $155 million at January 1, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. The projected
benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of plan assets for the U.S. and other plans was $21
million, $174 million, $327 million and $563 million on January 1, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003,
respectively. For the four months ended June 27, 2003, net pension expense of the Successor was
$9 million. The pension expense reflects the application of purchase accounting related to the
Acquisition, including the recognition of all unamortized gains and losses in the opening balance
sheet, and changes in actuarial assumptions at March 1, 2003. The fair value of plan assets in

56


-----

excess of the projected benefit obligations for the U.K. plan was $801 million at March 1, 2003 and
the projected benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of plan assets for the U.S. and other
plans was $801 million at March 1, 2003. See ‘‘—Critical accounting estimates—Employee benefit
plans’’, note 14 to the financial statements and ‘‘Unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated
statements of operations’’ for further discussion.

As a result of declines in pension asset values, different actuarial assumptions and the application of
purchase accounting, the Successor’s financial statements for the four months ended June 27, 2003
reflect net pension expense. However, we do not expect that we will be required to make cash
contributions to fund the U.K. plan in 2003.

#### Critical accounting estimates

The critical accounting estimates that affect our financial statements and that use judgments and
assumptions are listed below. In addition, the likelihood that materially different amounts could be
reported under varied conditions and assumptions is noted.

**_Product recalls_**

We are at risk for product recall costs. Recall costs are costs incurred when the customer or we
decide to recall a product through a formal campaign soliciting the return of specific products due to
a known or suspected safety concern. Product recall costs typically include the cost of the product
being replaced, customer cost of the recall and labor to remove and replace the defective part. When
a decision to recall a product has been made for which we bear some responsibility, we record the
estimated cost to us of the recall as a charge to net earnings in that period in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(‘‘SFAS’’) No. 5, ‘‘Accounting for Contingencies.’’ In making estimates relating to product recalls,
judgment is required as to the number of units to be returned, the total cost of the recall campaign,
the ultimate negotiated sharing of the cost between us and the customer and, in some cases, the
extent to which our supplier will share in the recall cost. As a result, our actual recall costs could be
significantly different from our estimated costs.

**_Impairment of long-lived assets other than intangibles_**

Long-lived assets other than intangibles are evaluated for impairment when events and
circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows to be
generated by those assets are less than their carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows are less
than the carrying value of the assets, the assets are written down to their fair value. The
determination of undiscounted cash flows is based on the businesses’ strategic plans and long-range
planning forecasts. The revenue growth rates included in the plans are based on industry specific
data. We use external vehicle build assumptions published by widely used external sources and
market share data by customer based on known and targeted awards over a five-year period. The
projected profit margin assumptions included in the plans are based on the current cost structure and
anticipated cost reductions. If different assumptions were used in these plans, the related
undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and additional impairment
of assets might be required to be recorded.

**_Goodwill and other intangible assets_**

We adopted SFAS No. 142, ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets’’ (‘‘SFAS 142’’) effective
January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 sets forth the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets already
recorded. Commencing January 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer being amortized, but is subject to
annual impairment analysis. Goodwill impairment testing is required to be performed at the reporting
unit level (defined as an operating segment, as that term is used in SFAS No. 131, ‘‘Disclosures
About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information’’ (‘‘SFAS 131’’), or one level below the
operating segment, depending on whether certain criteria are met). The carrying value of assets,
including goodwill, and liabilities are assigned to each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting

57


-----

unit is then determined and compared to the carrying value. If carrying value exceeds fair value, then
a possible impairment of goodwill exists and requires further evaluation. Goodwill was tested for
impairment as of January 1, 2002 by comparing the fair values of our three reporting units to their
carrying values. The Predecessor determined estimated fair values of its reporting units based on the
present value of the estimated future cash flows using a 9% discount rate and concluded there was
no impairment of goodwill. With the adoption of SFAS 142, the Predecessor reassessed the useful
lives and residual values of all acquired intangible assets to make any necessary amortization period
adjustments, which resulted in no adjustments being made. In accordance with SFAS 142, carrying
amounts in 2001 have not been restated.

We have applied the provisions of SFAS No. 141, ‘‘Business Combinations’’ (‘‘SFAS 141’’) in
determining the preliminary purchase price allocation and resulting fair values of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. See note 2 to the unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial
statements. After the application of purchase accounting reflecting the preliminary results of the
valuation studies necessary to estimate certain fair values, we have recorded approximately $3.1
billion in goodwill resulting from the Acquisition. In accordance with SFAS 142, future changes in our
businesses or the markets for our products could result in impairments of such goodwill or other
intangible assets recorded in connection with the Acquisition.

**_Employee benefit plans_**

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for
our pension plans and other post-retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management in
consultation with an outside actuary. Changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data,
such as the rate of increases in compensation levels and the long-term rate of return on plan assets.
Critical assumptions such as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate
used to measure our benefit obligations and health care cost projections are evaluated and updated
annually. Based on our assumptions as of February 28, 2003, as discussed below, a change in these
assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, would have the following effect on our costs on
an annual basis:

**One-fourth-percentage-point change**
**(Dollars in millions)** **Cost increase** **Cost decrease**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ (4) $ 4
Expected long-term rate of return . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (11) 11

**One-percentage-point change**
**(Dollars in millions)** **Cost increase** **Cost decrease**

Health care cost trend rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $11 $(9)

**_Pensions_**

We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, ‘‘Employers’
Accounting for Pensions’’ (‘‘SFAS 87’’), which requires that amounts recognized in financial
statements be determined on an actuarial basis. This determination involves the selection of an
expected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate. SFAS 87 and the policies we have used,
notably the use of a calculated value of plan assets for pensions (which is further described below),
generally reduced the volatility of pension income and expense that would have otherwise resulted
from changes in the value of the pension plan assets and pension liability discount rates. A
substantial portion of our pension benefits relate to our plans in the United States and the United
Kingdom. As discussed in ‘‘—Pension plans’’, the Predecessor’s results of operations for the periods

58


-----

presented through February 28, 2003 reflect net pension income due to the overfunded status of our
U.K. plan, net of pension expense for our U.S. and other plans. As of June 27, 2003, our results will
reflect net pension expense due to the combination of a decreased long-term rate of return
assumption on the assets, decreased discount rate and use of fair value of plan assets in our
purchase accounting, as opposed to the 5-year market related value used historically.

One key assumption in determining our net pension income/expense in accordance with SFAS 87 is
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The expected long-term rate of return on
pension assets for 2001 and 2002 were assumed to be 9.5% and 9.0%, respectively, in the U.S. and
8.75% in the U.K. The actual returns on pension assets were a negative 1.0% in 2000, a negative
4.3% in 2001 and a negative 2.5% in 2002 for the U.S. plans and a negative 0.9% in 2000, a
negative 8.6% in 2001 and a negative 14.4% in 2002 for the U.K. Over the last eleven years through
December 31, 2002, our U.S. and U.K. plans have averaged returns of 8.4% and 8.2%, respectively.
As of December 31, 2002, the Predecessor assumed long-term rates of return on pension assets of
9.0% in the U.S. and 8.75% in the U.K. These rates were used for the two month period ended
February 28, 2003. Beginning March 1, 2003, we are using assumed long-term rates of return on
pension assets of 8.5% in the U.S. and 7.75% in the UK. We review our long-term rate of return
assumptions annually through comparison of our historical actual rates of return with our
expectations, consultation with our actuaries regarding the assumptions used by other large
companies and consultation with our investment managers regarding their expectations for future
returns. While we believe our assumptions of future returns are reasonable and appropriate,
significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may
materially affect our pension obligations and our future pension income (expense). The expected
long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes
changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years. This produces the
expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income (expense). The difference between
this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average
remaining working life of the employees in each plan. While there were unrecognized losses that
existed in the Predecessor’s pension plans historically, the Predecessor amortized the asset gains
and losses over five years for determining the market related value of assets used to calculate the
expected return component of pension income. The fair value of the plan assets, as of February 28,
2003, was used to compute the expected return on plan assets that was included in the pension
expense of the Successor for the four month period ended June 27, 2003.

Another key assumption in determining our net pension income/expense is the determination of the
discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. The discount rate reflects the current rate at
which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate,
we look to rates of return on high quality, fixed-income investments that receive one of the two
highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency, and we review the assumption with our actuary.
As of December 31, 2001, the Predecessor determined its pension discount rates to be 7.25% for
the U.S. plans and 5.75% for the U.K. plan. As of December 31, 2002, the Predecessor assumed
discount rates of 6.5% and 5.5% for the U.S. plans and the U.K. plan, respectively. These rates were
used for the two month period ended February 28, 2003. Beginning March 1, 2003, we are using
discount rates of 6.25% and 5.5% for the U.S. plans and the U.K. plan respectively. Changes in
discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension income (expense), and
the net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial
assumptions and experience, have been deferred historically as allowed by SFAS 87. As a result of
the Acquisition and the application of purchase accounting, all unamortized historical changes were
immediately recognized in the opening balance sheet.

**_Other post-retirement benefits_**

We account for our other post-retirement benefits (‘‘OPEB’’) in accordance with SFAS No. 106,
‘‘Employers’ Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions’’ (‘‘SFAS 106’’), which
requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. This
determination requires the selection of a discount rate and health care cost trend rates used to value

benefit obligations. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the OPEB liabilities could be
effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, we look to rates of return on high
quality, fixed-income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized
ratings agency and we review the assumption with our actuary. As of December 31, 2001, the
Predecessor determined its discount rate for OPEB to be 7.25%. The Predecessor used a discount
rate for OPEB of 6.5% for the two month period ended February 28, 2003, based on information
available as of December 31, 2002. Beginning March 1, 2003, we are using a discount rate for
OPEB of 6.25%. We develop our estimate of the health care cost trend rates used to value benefit
obligations through review of our recent health care cost trend experience and through discussions
with our actuary regarding the experience of similar companies. At December 31, 2001, the
Predecessor assumed a 6.4% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care
benefits for the U.S. plan (representing substantially all of the OPEB benefits) which was assumed to
gradually decrease to 5.1% in the year 2009 and remain at that level thereafter. At December 31,
2002, the Predecessor assumed a 10.0% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered
health care benefits for the U.S. plan, which was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% over eight
years and remain at that level thereafter. This assumption was not changed upon the Acquisition. We
fund our OPEB obligation on a pay-as-you-go basis and have no plan assets. Changes in the
assumed discount rate or health care cost trend rate can have a significant impact on our actuarially
determined liability and related OPEB expense.

**_Environmental_**

Governmental regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise
relating to the protection of the environment, have had, and will continue to have, an effect on our
operations and us. We have made and continue to make expenditures for projects relating to the
environment, including pollution control devices for new and existing facilities. We are conducting a
number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations to
comply with applicable requirements and, along with other companies, have been named a
potentially responsible party for certain waste management sites.

A reserve estimate for each matter is established using standard engineering cost estimating
techniques on an undiscounted basis. In the determination of such costs, consideration is given to
the professional judgment of our environmental engineers, in consultation with outside environmental
specialists, when necessary. At multi-party sites, the reserve estimate also reflects the expected
allocation of total project costs among the various potentially responsible parties. Each of the
environmental matters is subject to various uncertainties, and some of these matters may be
resolved unfavorably to us. We believe that any liability, in excess of amounts accrued in our
consolidated financial statements, that may result from the resolution of these matters for which
sufficient information is available to support cost estimates, will not have a material adverse affect on
our financial position, result of operations or cash flows. However, we cannot predict the effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows for aspects of certain matters for which there is
insufficient information. In addition, we cannot predict the effect of compliance with environmental
laws and regulations with respect to unknown environmental matters.

#### Total company results of operations

The historical and pro forma results of operations of the Predecessor and the Successor reflect the
impact of various unusual items during the periods discussed. Earnings (losses) from continuing

#### Pro forma six months ended June 27, 2003 compared to pro forma six months ended June 28, 2002

**_Sales for the six months ended June 27, 2003 of $5,790 million increased $502 million from $5,288_**
million for the six months ended June 28, 2002. Higher sales resulted primarily from the favorable
impact of foreign currency exchange of $507 million partially offset by $5 million for the unfavorable
impact of price reductions in excess of higher volume from new product growth. Globally our sales
volume is up nearly 2% year on year. In North America where production was down 3% (5% within
the ‘‘Big Three’’ VMs) our sales were 3% down. In Europe where production was slightly down, our
sales were up 5% year on year due to our strong business base in that marketplace. Significant
volume growth in the Asia Pacific region was achieved during the period.

**_Gross profit for the six months ended June 27, 2003 of $715 million declined $9 million from $724_**
million for the six months ended June 28, 2002. The decrease primarily resulted from a decline in net
pension and OPEB income of $88 million, and the net unfavorable impact of negative product mix
and higher volume of $39 million in the prior year period, partially offset by the favorable impact of
foreign currency exchange of $70 million, cost reduction savings in excess of inflation and lower
pricing of $43 million, and lower charges for unusual items of $7 million. Gross profit for the six
months ended June 27, 2003 was reduced by unusual items of $3 million, which were primarily
restructuring costs for severance. Net pension and OPEB income included in gross profit for the six
months ended June 27, 2003 was approximately $2 million compared to $90 million for the six
months ended June 28, 2002. Gross profit for the six months ended June 28, 2002 was reduced by
unusual items of $10 million, consisting of restructuring expense primarily for severance of $7 million,
restructuring expense for asset impairments of $2 million, and asset impairment charges other than
restructuring of $1 million. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the six months ended June 27,
2003 was 12.3% compared to 13.7% for the six months ended June 28, 2002.

**_Administrative and selling expenses for the six months ended June 27, 2003 of $273 million_**
increased $30 million from $243 million for the six months ended June 28, 2002. Higher costs
resulted primarily from the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange of $15 million, an
increase in charges for unusual items of $8 million, and an increase in advertising and professional
fees of $5 million. Administrative and selling expenses for the six months ended June 27, 2003
included $8 million of charges for unusual items, which consisted of approximately $5 million for
costs associated with our separation from Northrop Grumman and $3 million of restructuring costs.
Net pension and OPEB expense included in administrative and selling expenses for the six months
ended June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002 was approximately $13 million and $11 million, respectively.
Administrative and selling expenses as a percentage of sales were 4.7% for the six months ended
June 27, 2003 compared to 4.6% for the six months ended June 28, 2002.

**_Research and development expenses were $81 million for the six months ended June 27, 2003_**
compared to $74 million for the six months ended June 28, 2002. Expenses increased primarily due
to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange of $9 million, partially offset by lower
spending and cost reductions. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were
1.4% for the six months ended June 27, 2003 and for the six months ended June 28, 2002.

**_Other (income) expense – net for the six months ended June 27, 2003 was income of $21 million_**
compared to expense of $7 million for the six months ended June 28, 2002. Other income for the six
months ended June 27, 2003 consisted of unrealized foreign currency exchange gains of $16 million,
earnings of affiliates of $4 million, asset impairment expense of $1 million and other miscellaneous
income of $2 million. Other expense for the six months ended June 28, 2002 consisted of earnings of
affiliates of $2 million, net gains on sales of assets of $5 million, asset impairment expense of $3
million and other expenses of $11 million.

**_Interest expense for the six months ended June 27, 2003 was $142 million compared to $140_**
million for the six months ended June 28, 2002.

**_The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 27, 2003 was higher than the statutory rate_**
due primarily to tax losses in the U.S., where tax benefits were being fully reserved. These tax losses

64


-----

were primarily being generated by interest expense. The blended rate used for the four months
ended June 27, 2003 was 61%. For the two months ended February 28, 2003 the combined
statement of operations includes an allocation to the Predecessor of TRW’s and Northrop Grumman’s
income taxes (credits) in amounts generally equivalent to the provisions that would have resulted had
these entities filed separate income tax returns for the period presented.

**_EBITDA for the six months ended June 27, 2003 was $607 million compared to $614 million for the_**
six months ended June 28, 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from a decline in net pension and
OPEB income of $90 million and the impact of negative product mix, partially offset by higher volume
of $39 million, an increase in charges for unusual items of $4 million and other net costs of $5
million. These decreases were largely offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency of $79
million, and savings from cost reduction activities in excess of inflation and lower pricing of $52
million. Net pension and OPEB expense for the six months ended June 27, 2003 was $10 million
compared to income of $79 million for the six months ended June 28, 2002. EBITDA for the six
months ended June 27, 2003 was reduced by unusual items of $12 million, which consisted of
restructuring expenses (principally for severance) of $6 million and $6 million for costs associated
with our separation from Northrop Grumman. EBITDA for the six months ended June 28, 2002 was
reduced by unusual items totaling $8 million, which consisted of restructuring expense (mainly for
severance) of $7 million, restructuring expense for asset impairments of $2 million, asset impairment
charges other than restructuring of $4 million, and net gain on sale of assets of $5 million.

EBITDA, a measure used by management to measure performance, is reconciled to net earnings
(losses) in the following table. Our management believes EBITDA is useful to the investors because
it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of
companies in our industry. EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and does not purport to be
an alternative to net earnings (losses) as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from
operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Because not all companies use identical calculations,
this presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
companies. Additionally, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s
discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax
payments and debt service requirements. The amounts shown for EBITDA, as presented herein,
differ from the amounts calculated under the definition of EBITDA used in our debt instruments. The
definition of EBITDA used in our debt instruments is further adjusted for certain cash and non-cash
charges and is used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in
certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain payments.

The following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings to EBITDA:

#### Short period discussions on a historical basis

As a result of the Acquisition, our historical results of operations for the four months ended June 27,
2003 are reported on a different basis under the purchase method of accounting and thus are not
comparable to previous periods of the Predecessor. Following is a discussion of the results of
operations of the Predecessor for the two months ended February 28, 2003 and of the Successor for
the four months ended June 27, 2003 on a historical basis.

65


-----

#### Two months ended February 28, 2003

For the two months ended February 28, 2003, the Predecessor generated sales of $1,916 million,
with cost of sales of $1,686 million, resulting in a gross profit of $230 million and a gross profit
margin of 12.0%. Administrative and selling expenses were $100 million or 5.2% of sales. Research
and development expenses were $27 million or 1.4% of sales. Amortization of intangible assets was
$2 million, other expense was $4 million and operating income was $97 million or 5.1% of sales.
Interest expense was $48 million, interest income was $1 million and income tax expense was $19
million. Net earnings was $31 million or 1.6% of sales.

#### Four months ended June 27, 2003

For the four months ended June 27, 2003, the Successor generated sales of $3,917 million, with cost
of sales of $3,488 million, resulting in a gross profit of $429 million and a gross profit margin of
11.0%. Administrative and selling expenses were $175 million or 4.5% of sales. Research and

#### Historical 2002 compared to 2001

**_Sales for 2002 of $10.6 billion increased $539 million from $10.1 billion in 2001. The increase_**
resulted from higher volume, net of price reductions, of $384 million, and the positive impact of
foreign currency exchange of $224 million, partially offset by the effect of divestitures completed in
2001 of $69 million. Higher volume primarily reflected higher customer vehicle production in North
America and sales growth in the Asia Pacific region.

**_Gross profit for 2002 of $1,315 million increased $213 million from $1,102 million in 2001. The_**
increase was primarily due to a decrease in unusual items of $108 million, the combined effect of
savings from cost reduction activities and a seat belt recall in the third quarter of 2001, net of price
reductions and inflation, of $104 million, the net positive impact of higher sales volume and product
mix of $24 million, higher UK pension income of $16 million, and the favorable effect of foreign
currency exchange of $13 million. This increase was partially offset by a combination of higher costs
due to a product launch in Europe, a temporary increase in costs following the closing of a facility in
Europe and asset write-offs totaling $32 million, and the impact of divestitures completed in 2001 of
$23 million. Gross profit in 2002 was reduced by unusual items totaling $61 million, consisting of
restructuring charges of $43 million, principally for asset impairments and severance related
expenses, asset impairment charges other than restructuring of $14 million and other charges related
to employee compensation arising from the Northrop Grumman acquisition of TRW of $4 million.
Gross profit in 2001 was reduced by unusual items totaling $169 million, consisting of $126 million in
restructuring expenses, asset impairment charges other than restructuring of $38 million and other
charges of $5 million. Gross profit margin for 2002 increased to 12.4% from 10.9% in 2001.

**_Administrative and selling expenses for 2002 of $541 million decreased $56 million from $597_**
million in 2001. Lower expenses resulted primarily from a decrease in unusual items of $52 million,
the effect of divestitures completed in 2001 of $10 million and net cost reductions of $6 million,
partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange of $6 million and higher costs
associated with increased volume of $4 million. Administrative and selling expenses in 2002 included
charges for unusual items of $35 million, consisting of restructuring expenses primarily for severance

66


-----

of $16 million and other charges of $19 million related to employee compensation arising from the
Northrop Grumman acquisition of TRW. Administrative and selling expenses in 2001 included unusual
items related to restructuring charges of $87 million. Administrative and selling expenses as a
percentage of sales were 5.1% in 2002 compared to 5.9 % in 2001.

**_Research and development expenses were $151 million in 2002 and $131 million in 2001. The_**
increase in expenses is primarily due to additional engineering costs on next generation vehicle
control systems and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange.

**_Interest expense for 2002 of $316 million decreased $57 million from $373 million in 2001. The_**
decrease resulted from lower average debt outstanding and lower short-term interest rates in the
United States.

**_Amortization of intangible assets and goodwill was $15 million in 2002 compared to $78 million in_**
2001. The decrease resulted primarily from the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, in
accordance with which goodwill is no longer amortized.

**_Other (income) expense – net was income of $6 million and $2 million for 2002 and 2001,_**
respectively. Other income for 2002 consisted of net gain on sale of assets of $12 million, earnings of
affiliates of $6 million and miscellaneous other income of $4 million, partially offset by asset
impairment charges of $9 million and foreign currency exchange losses of $7 million. Other income
for 2001 consisted of a net gain on the sale of assets of $18 million, primarily from the disposition of
electrical products and aftermarket businesses in India and Turkey, earnings of affiliate of $9 million
and other income of $15 million, partially offset by pending and threatened litigation expenses of $29
million and asset impairment charges of $11 million.

**_The effective tax rate was 45.9% in both 2002 and 2001._**

**_EBITDA for 2002 of $1,123 million increased $277 million from $846 million for 2001. The increase_**
resulted primarily from a reduction in unusual items of $192 million, the combined positive impact of
a seatbelt recall in 2001 and cost reductions in excess of lower pricing and inflation of $102 million,
the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange of $16 million, the net positive impact of higher
volume partially reduced by a shift to lower margin products of $11 million, and an increase in net
pension and OPEB income of $10 million. The increase was partially reduced by higher costs related
to a product launch in Europe, a temporary increase in costs following the closure of a facility in
Europe and asset write-offs totaling $32 million, and the unfavorable impact of divestitures completed
in 2001 of $10 million. EBITDA for 2002 included unusual items totaling $88 million, consisting of
restructuring charges of $58 million, asset impairment charges other than restructuring of $17 million,
charges related to the acquisition of TRW by Northrop Grumman of $23 million, litigation charges of
$2 million and gains on asset sales of $12 million. EBITDA for 2001 included unusual items
aggregating $280 million, consisting of restructuring charges of $213 million, asset impairment
charges other than restructuring of $49 million, charges for pending and threatened litigation and
claims of $36 million, and gains on the sale of assets of $18 million. EBITDA included net pension
and OPEB income of $153 million in 2002 and $143 million in 2001.

#### Historical 2001 compared to 2000

**_Sales for 2001 of $10.1 billion decreased approximately $830 million from $10.9 billion in 2000. The_**
decrease resulted primarily from $282 million of reduced sales due to the effects of a decline in
vehicle production by our customers, primarily in North America, the negative effect of foreign
currency exchange of $211 million, business divestitures of $198 million and lower pricing of $150
million.

**_Gross profit for 2001 of $1,102 million decreased $381 million from $1,483 million in 2000. The_**
decrease was primarily due to lower volume and lower margin on new products of $207 million, lower
pricing of $150 million, increased warranty and recall charges of $29 million, the effect of foreign
currency exchange of $39 million, divestitures of $58 million and an increase in unusual items of $22
million, partially offset by net cost reductions of $146 million. Gross profit for 2001 was negatively
impacted by unusual items totaling $169 million, consisting of $126 million in restructuring expenses,

67


-----

asset impairment charges of $38 million and other charges of $5 million. Gross profit for 2000 was
reduced by unusual items totaling $147 million, consisting of restructuring charges of $43 million,
charges for the impairment of assets of $67 million and other charges of $37 million, primarily for
certain warranty costs. Gross profit margin for 2001 decreased to 10.9% from 13.6% in 2000.

**_Administrative and selling expenses for 2001 of $597 million decreased $73 million from $670_**
million in 2000, primarily due to the effects of divestitures of $35 million, cost reductions and lower
general and administrative corporate expenses allocated to us of $61 million and the effect of foreign
currency exchange of $10 million, which were partially offset by an increase in restructuring charges
of $45 million. Administrative and selling expenses included unusual items related to restructuring
charges of $87 million in 2001 and $42 million in 2000. Administrative and selling expenses as a
percentage of sales improved to 5.9% in 2001 from 6.1% in 2000.

**_Research and development expenses for 2001 were $131 million and $167 million in 2000. Lower_**
spending on research and development was primarily the result of cost reductions of $17 million and
a shift in resources to applications engineering, which relates to applying products to fit customers’
needs, of $13 million.

**_Interest expense for 2001 of $373 million decreased $14 million from $387 million in 2000 as a_**
result of lower short-term interest rates in the United States and lower average debt balances,
including debt allocated from TRW.

**_Other (income) expense—net was income of $2 million and zero in 2001 and 2000, respectively._**
Included in 2001 were net gains on sales of assets of $18 million, primarily from the disposition of
electrical products and aftermarket businesses in India and Turkey, asset impairment charges of $11
million, pending and threatened litigation expenses of $29 million, earnings of affiliates of $9 million
and other income of $15 million. Included in 2000 were net gains on sales of assets of $22 million,
primarily from the disposition of Nelson Stud Welding and Australian Steering, offset by $9 million of
unrealized losses on foreign currency hedges associated with the Lucas Varity acquisition, pending
and threatened litigation charges of $25 million, earnings of affiliates of $7 million and other income
of $5 million.

**_The effective tax rate in 2001 was 45.9% compared to 51.9% in 2000. The decrease in the effective_**
tax rate resulted primarily from the loss position in 2001, lower foreign taxes in 2001 and
non-deductible penalties in 2000.

**_EBITDA for 2001 of $846 million decreased $301 million from $1,147 million for 2000. The decrease_**
resulted primarily from the combined impact of lower sales volume and lower margin on new
products of $207 million, an increase in charges for unusual items of $58 million, the impact of
unfavorable foreign currency exchange of $42 million, increased warranty and recall charges of $29
million, and divestitures of $23 million, partially offset by cost reductions in excess of lower pricing
and inflation of $70 million. EBITDA for 2001 included unusual items aggregating $280 million,
consisting of restructuring charges of $213 million, asset impairment charges other than restructuring
of $49 million, and pending and threatened litigation and claims of $36 million, partially offset by
gains on the sale of assets of $18 million. EBITDA for 2000 included unusual items totaling $222
million, consisting of restructuring charges of $85, asset impairment charges other than restructuring
of $67 million, pending and threatened litigation charges of $65 million, unrealized losses on foreign
currency hedges and expenses related to the acquisition of Lucas Varity of $9 million, and other
charges of $17 million, partially offset by gains on the sale of assets of $21 million. EBITDA included
net pension and OPEB income of $143 million in 2001 and $146 million in 2000.

#### Pro forma six months ended June 27, 2003 compared to pro forma six months ended June 28, 2002

**_Sales for the six months ended June 27, 2003 of $3,309 million increased $365 million from $2,944_**
million for the six months ended June 28, 2002. The increase resulted from the favorable impact of
foreign currency exchange of $270 million and $95 million for the combined favorable impact of
higher customer volume and new product growth, net of lower pricing.

**_Profit before taxes for the six months ended June 27, 2003 of $166 million declined $6 million from_**
$172 million for the six months June 28, 2002. The decrease primarily resulted from an unfavorable
product mix that was partly offset by the favorable effect of higher volume of $19 million, and an
increase in net pension and OPEB expense of $15 million, partially offset by the favorable impact of
foreign currency exchange of $15 million and savings from cost reduction activities in excess of
inflation and lower pricing of $14 million. Unusual items for the six months ended June 27, 2003
included restructuring expense of $5 million, primarily severance due to workforce reductions.
Unusual items for the six months ended June 28, 2002 included restructuring expense of $3 million,
primarily for severance and an asset impairment charge.

#### Historical 2002 compared to 2001

**_Sales for 2002 of $6,078 million increased $461 million from $5,617 million in 2001. The increase in_**
2002 sales resulted primarily from higher volume, net of price reductions, of $346 million and the
favorable impact of foreign currency exchange of $114 million. Higher volume was mainly due to
increased vehicle customer production in North America and sales growth in the Asia Pacific region.

**_Profit before taxes for 2002 of $256 million increased $28 million from $228 million in 2001. The_**
increase resulted primarily from a decrease of $84 million in unusual items and the positive impact of
higher volume and product mix of $8 million, partially offset by the negative impact of lower pricing
and inflation in excess of cost reductions of $27 million, a combination of higher costs due to a
product launch in Europe, temporary cost increases following the closing of a facility in Europe and
asset write-offs totaling $25 million, and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange of $5
million. Unusual items in 2002 included restructuring charges of $20 million, primarily for severance
and asset impairments, and asset impairment charges other than restructuring of $6 million. Unusual
items in 2001 included several restructuring program charges aggregating $86 million, asset
impairment charges of $28 million and other charges of $5 million, partially offset by gains on asset
sales of $9 million.

#### Historical 2001 compared to 2000

**_Sales for 2001 of $5,617 million decreased $353 million from $5,970 million in 2000. The decrease in_**
2001 sales resulted primarily from lower volume of $178 million due to lower vehicle production in
North America partially offset by higher vehicle production in Europe, the effect of foreign currency
exchange of $134 million and lower pricing of $32 million.

**_Profit before taxes for 2001 of $228 million decreased $143 million from $371 million in 2000. The_**
decrease resulted primarily from lower sales volume and lower margin on new products totaling $159
million, lower pricing of $32 million, the effect of foreign currency exchange of $17 million and a $9

#### Historical 2002 compared to 2001

**_Sales for 2002 of $3,143 million increased $146 million from $2,997 million in 2001. Increased sales_**
resulted from the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange of $74 million and the positive
impact of higher volume, net of lower pricing, of $72 million.

**_Profit before taxes for 2002 of $224 million increased $114 million compared to $110 million in_**
2001. The increase primarily reflected the net combined effect of a seat belt recall in 2001 and cost
reductions in excess of lower pricing and inflation of $93 million, the net positive impact of higher

#### Historical 2001 compared to 2000

**_Sales for 2001 of $2,997 million decreased $185 million from $3,182 million in 2000. The decrease in_**
2001 sales resulted primarily from lower pricing of $107 million, the effect of foreign currency
exchange of $59 million and lower volume of $26 million due to lower production in North America
slightly offset by higher vehicle production in Europe.

**_Profit before taxes for 2001 of $110 million decreased $24 million from $134 million in 2000. The_**
decrease resulted primarily from lower pricing of $107 million, lower sales volume and lower margin

#### Pro forma six months ended June 27, 2003 compared to pro forma six months ended June 28, 2002

**_Sales for the six months June 27, 2003 of $780 million increased $50 million from $730 million for_**
the six months ended June 28, 2002. The increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of
foreign currency exchange of $75 million, which was partially offset by unfavorable impact of lower
volume and price reductions of $25 million.

**_Profit before taxes for the six months ended June 27, 2003 of $74 million improved $7 million from_**
$67 million for the six months ended June 28, 2002. The improvement primarily resulted from savings
from cost reductions in excess of inflation and lower customer pricing totaling $11 million and the
favorable impact of foreign currency exchange of $7 million, partially offset by the unfavorable impact
of lower volume and adverse product mix of $5 million and higher net pension and OPEB expense of
$4 million.

#### Historical 2002 compared to 2001

**_Sales for 2002 of $1,409 million declined $68 million compared to $1,477 million in 2001. The decline_**
in sales resulted from the effect of divestitures completed in 2001 of $69 million, and the combination
of lower volume and price reductions totaling $35 million, partially offset by the favorable effect of
foreign currency exchange of $36 million.

**_Profit before taxes for 2002 of $148 million increased $108 million compared to $40 million in 2001._**
The increase was primarily due to lower unusual items of $86 million, cost reductions in excess of
lower pricing and inflation of $35 million, and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange of $4
million, partially offset by the effect of divestitures completed in 2001 of $10 million and negative
impact of lower volume of $5 million. Unusual items in 2002 included restructuring charges of $4
million, primarily for severance, and asset impairment charges of $6 million, offset by gains on asset
sales of $7 million and other income of $5 million.

#### Historical 2001 compared to 2000

**_Sales for 2001 of $1,477 million decreased $291 million from $1,768 million in 2000. The decrease in_**
2001 sales resulted primarily from lower volume of $78 million due to lower vehicle production in
North America partially offset by higher vehicle production in Europe, divestitures of several
businesses in 2001 and in 2000 of $198 million, the effect of foreign currency exchange of $18
million and lower pricing of $11 million.

73


-----

**_Profit before taxes for 2001 of $40 million decreased $116 million from $156 million in 2000. The_**
decrease resulted primarily from higher unusual items of $77 million, lower sales volume and lower
margin on new products totaling $17 million, the effect of divestitures of $21 million and lower pricing
of $11 million, partially offset by cost reductions of $16 million. Unusual items in 2001 included
several restructuring programs aggregating approximately $80 million, asset impairment charges of
$12 million and other charges of $2 million, which were partially offset by net gains on the sale of
assets of $10 million. Unusual items included in profit before taxes in 2000 were $23 million related
to restructuring actions and $15 million for asset impairment charges, which were partially offset by a
gain on sale of a business of $31 million.

#### Liquidity and capital resources

**_Debt and commitments_**

Historically, prior to the Acquisition, the principal source of liquidity for the Predecessor was cash flow
generated from operations, and principal liquidity requirements were for working capital and capital
expenditures. In the United States, the Predecessor historically participated in a consolidated cash
management system operated by TRW. Under this arrangement, the Predecessor’s short-term
financing was obtained from TRW rather than from external sources. Following the Acquisition, we
have been operating using our own consolidated cash management system.

Our primary source of liquidity continues to be cash flow generated from operations. We also have
availability under our new revolving credit facility and new receivables facility, subject to certain
conditions, described below. See ‘‘—Off-balance sheet arrangements.’’ Our primary liquidity
requirements are expected to be for debt service, working capital, capital expenditures and research
and development.

We are significantly leveraged. In connection with the Acquisition, we issued the senior notes and the
senior subordinated notes in a private offering, entered into new senior credit facilities, consisting of a
revolving credit facility and term loan facilities, and initiated a trade accounts receivable securitization
program, or the receivables facility. As of June 27, 2003, we had outstanding $3,454 million in
aggregate indebtedness, with an additional $449 million of borrowing capacity available under our
revolving credit facility, after giving effect to $51 million in outstanding letters of credit, which reduces
the amount available. At June 27, 2003, we had no advances outstanding under our receivables
facility. Our liquidity requirements will be significant, primarily due to debt service requirements and
costs incurred in connection with our receivables facility.

We subsequently refinanced $200 million of the borrowings under our term loan A facility and all of
the borrowings under our term loan B facilities with the proceeds of new term loan C facilities,
together with approximately $46 million of cash, on July 22, 2003 in order to reduce our interest
expense. As a result of this refinancing, while our liquidity requirements will continue to be significant,
we expect a reduction in our annual cash interest expense of approximately $10 million.

The senior credit facilities, as amended, consist of a secured revolving credit facility and various
senior secured term loan facilities. The revolving credit facility, through a syndication of banks,
provides for borrowings of up to $500 million including the availability of letters of credit, and is
available in U.S. dollars, euros, pounds sterling and other currencies. The revolving credit facility
matures on February 28, 2009. The term loan facilities consist of a $210 million term loan A facility
that matures on February 28, 2009 and term loan C facilities that mature on February 28, 2011
consisting of a $1,150 million dollar-denominated facility and approximately t95 million
euro-denominated facility. The senior credit facilities are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior
secured basis, in each case, by substantially all existing and future wholly owned domestic
subsidiaries and by TRW Automotive Luxembourg. In addition, all obligations under the senior credit
facilities, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all the assets of TRW
Automotive Holdings, the Company and each U.S. guarantor, subject to certain exceptions. The
obligations of the foreign subsidiary borrowers under the senior credit facilities, and foreign
guarantees of such obligations are, subject to certain exceptions and only to the extent permitted by

74


-----

applicable legal and contractual provisions and to the extent that it does not result in adverse tax
consequences, secured by substantially all of the assets of the foreign subsidiary borrowers and
foreign subsidiary guarantors.

Borrowings under the senior credit facilities, as amended, bear interest at a rate equal to an
applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of
(1) JPMorgan Chase Bank’s prime rate and (2) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1% or (b) a LIBOR
or a eurocurrency rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for deposits in the currency of
such borrowing for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs.
At June 27, 2003, the margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan A
facility was 2.50% with respect to base rate borrowings and 3.50% with respect to eurocurrency
borrowings. The applicable margin for such borrowings may be reduced or increased based on our
attaining certain leverage ratios. At June 27, 2003, the applicable margin for borrowings under the
term loan B facilities was 3.00% with respect to base rate borrowings and 4.00% with respect to
eurocurrency borrowings. Assuming the same leverage ratio, at June 27, 2003, on a pro forma basis,
the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan C facilities would have been 2.00% with
respect to base rate borrowings and 3.00% with respect to eurocurrency borrowings. The applicable
margin for the borrowings under term loan C facilities is not subject to reduction.

In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the senior credit facilities, we are
required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the
unutilized commitments thereunder at a rate equal to 0.75% per annum (to be reduced to 0.50% per
annum during the period (a) in which borrowings under the revolving facility exceed 50% of total
revolving facility commitments or (b) that we maintain a total leverage ratio of less than 3.25 to 1.00
but greater than 2.00 to 1.00, and to be further reduced to 0.375% per annum during the period in
which we maintain a total leverage ratio of less than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00). We also pay
customary letter of credit fees.

The term loans amortize each year generally in equal quarterly amounts (or in the case of the period
after December 31, 2009 with respect to term loan C facilities, in quarterly amounts until the maturity
date) in the following approximate aggregate principal amounts (in millions) for each year set forth
below:

Our outstanding senior notes consist of $925 million principal amount of 9[3]⁄8% Senior Notes due
2013 and t200 million principal amount of 10[1]⁄8% Senior Notes due 2013. Our outstanding senior
subordinated notes consist of $300 million principal amount of 11% Senior Subordinated Notes due
2013 and t125 million principal amount of 11¾% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013. Interest is
payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, with the first payment having been made on
August 15, 2003. Our outstanding senior notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured
basis and our outstanding senior subordinated notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior
subordinated unsecured basis, in each case, by substantially all existing and future wholly owned
domestic subsidiaries and by TRW Automotive Luxembourg, our restricted Luxembourg subsidiary.

The senior credit facilities, senior notes and senior subordinated notes contain a number of
covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability and the ability of
our subsidiaries, to sell assets, incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock, repay other
indebtedness (including, in the case of the senior credit facilities, the senior notes and senior
subordinated notes), pay certain dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock, create liens
on assets, make investments, loans or advances, make certain acquisitions, engage in mergers or
consolidations, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, engage in certain transactions with
affiliates, amend certain material agreements governing our indebtedness (including, in the case of
the senior credit facilities, the senior notes, senior subordinated notes and the receivables facility),
and change the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries. In addition, the senior credit facilities
contain the following financial covenants: a maximum total leverage ratio, a minimum interest
coverage ratio, and a maximum capital expenditures limitation and require certain prepayments from
excess cash flows, as defined.

Included in short term debt is a short-term note payable to Northrop Grumman reflecting certain
estimated post-closing adjustments, subject to final negotiations. The obligation accrues interest at
LIBOR and is payable after the final determination of the purchase price is agreed.

We believe that funds generated from operations and planned borrowing capacity will be adequate to
fund debt service requirements, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and
company-sponsored research and development programs. Our ability to continue to fund these items
and continue to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative
and regulatory factors, and the cost of warranty and recall and litigation claims, among other things.

We believe that our current financial position and financing plans will provide flexibility in worldwide
financing activities and permit us to respond to changing conditions in credit markets. We cannot
assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that
future borrowings will be available to us under our new revolving credit facility or receivables facility
in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.

**_Cash flows_**

Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 27, 2003 was $230 million as
compared to $332 million for the six months ended June 28, 2002. The $102 million decrease was
due primarily to higher earnings in the prior year period and higher net working capital requirements
in 2003, due to uncollected receivables given the quarter end date of June 27.

Cash used in investing activities increased from $135 million in the first six months of 2002 to
approximately $3,445 million in the six months ended June 27, 2003 principally due to the use of
borrowed funds to consummate the Acquisition. Capital expenditures in the six months ended June
27, 2003 were $131 million compared to $148 million in the comparable prior year period.

Cash provided by financing activities was $3,921 million for the six months ended June 27, 2003
compared to approximately $126 million used in financing activities for the same period in 2002. The
increase was due to new borrowings used to finance the Acquisition, as well as net amounts
received from TRW to settle intercompany accounts.

**_Capital expenditures_**

We expect to spend approximately $420 million in capital expenditures in 2003, primarily in
connection with the continuation of new product launches started in 2002, upgrading existing
products, additional new product launches in 2003 and providing for incremental capacity,
infrastructure and equipment at our facilities to support our manufacturing and cost reduction efforts.
Our capital expenditures for the six months ended June 27, 2003 were $131 million.

plant and equipment purchases in the ordinary course of business.
#### Off-balance sheet arrangements

We do not have guarantees related to unconsolidated entities which have, or are reasonably likely to
have, a material current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In connection with the Acquisition, we entered into a receivables facility which provides up to $600
million in funding from commercial paper conduits sponsored by several of the lenders under our
senior credit facilities, based on availability of eligible receivables and other customary factors. At the
closing of the Acquisition, certain of our subsidiaries (the ‘‘sellers’’) signed a receivables purchase
agreement and began selling trade accounts receivables (the ‘‘receivables’’) originated by them in the
United States through the receivables facility. Receivables are sold to TRW Automotive Receivables
LLC (the ‘‘transferor’’) at a discount. The transferor is a bankruptcy-remote special purpose limited
liability company that is our wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary. The transferor’s purchase of
receivables is financed through a transfer agreement with TRW Automotive Global Receivables LLC
(the ‘‘borrower’’). Under the terms of the transfer agreement, the borrower purchases all receivables
sold to the transferor. The borrower is a bankruptcy-remote qualifying special purpose limited liability
company that is wholly-owned by the transferor and is not consolidated when certain requirements
are met as further described below.

Multi-seller commercial paper conduits supported by committed liquidity facilities are available to
provide cash funding for the borrowers’ purchase of receivables through secured loans/tranches to
the extent desired and permitted under the receivables loan agreement. A note is issued by the
borrower to the transferor for the difference between the purchase price for the receivables
purchased and cash available to be borrowed through the facility. The sellers of the receivables act
as servicing agents per the servicing agreement and continue to service the transferred receivables
for which they receive a monthly servicing fee at a rate of 1% per annum of the average daily
outstanding balance of receivables. The usage fee under the facility is 1.50% of outstanding
borrowings. In addition, we are required to pay a fee of 0.50% on the unused portion of the
receivables facility. These rates are per annum and payments of these fees are made to the lenders
on the monthly settlement date.

Availability of funding under the receivables facility depends primarily upon the outstanding trade
accounts receivable balance for the week as of Friday of the previous week. This balance is reported
no later than the third business day of the subsequent week to the lenders. Availability is determined
by reducing the receivables balance by outstanding borrowings under the program, the historical rate
of collection on those receivables and other characteristics of those receivables that affect their

77


-----

eligibility (such as bankruptcy or downgrading below investment grade of the obligor, delinquency and
excessive concentration.) Based on the terms of this facillity and on the criteria described above, as
of June 27, 2003, approximately $433 million of the Company’s accounts receivable balance was
considered eligible for borrowings under the program, of which approximately $360 million would
have been available for funding. We had no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of June 27,
2003.

This facility can be treated as a general financing agreement or as an off balance sheet financing
arrangement. Whether the funding and related receivables are shown as liabilities and assets,
respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet, or, conversely, are removed from the consolidated
balance sheet depends on the level of the multi-seller conduits’ loans to the borrower. When such
level is at least 10% of the fair value of all of the borrower’s assets (consisting principally of
receivables sold by the sellers), the securitization transactions are accounted for as a sale of the
receivables under the provisions of SFAS 140, ‘‘Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial
Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,’’ and are removed from the consolidated balance sheet.
The proceeds received are included in cash flows from operating activities in the statements of cash
flows. Costs associated with the receivables facility are recorded as loss on sale of receivables in the
Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The book value of the Company’s retained interest
in the receivables approximates fair market value due to the current nature of the receivables.

However, at such time as the fair value of the multi-seller commercial paper conduits’ loans are less
than 10% of the fair value of all of the borrower’s assets, we are required to consolidate the
borrower, resulting in the funding and related receivables being shown as liabilities and assets,
respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet and the costs associated with the receivables facility
being recorded as interest expense. As there were no borrowings outstanding under the receivables
facility on June 27, 2003, the fair value of the multi-seller conduits’ loans was less than 10% of the
fair value of all of the borrower’s assets and, therefore, the financial position and results of operations
of the borrower were included in our consolidated financial statements as of June 27, 2003.

#### Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

We are subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global economy. Our practice is to utilize
derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks. Historically, the
Predecessor managed cash flow transactional foreign currency exchange risk pursuant to TRW’s
written corporate policy. Forward contracts and, to a lesser extent, options are utilized to protect our
cash flow from adverse movements in exchange rates. Forward contracts and options are only used
to hedge transaction exposures and are accounted for according to SFAS No. 133 ‘‘Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities’’. Risk associated with translation exposures are not
hedged. Transactional currency exposures are reviewed every four months and any natural offsets
are considered prior to entering into a derivative financial instrument. Following the Acquisition, we
are operating in accordance with written policies regarding the use of derivative financial instruments
that are similar to those historically maintained by TRW, but we are continuing to evaluate these
policies.

We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the derivative
financial instruments. We limit this exposure by entering into agreements directly with a number of
major financial institutions that meet our credit standards and that are expected to satisfy fully their
obligations under the contracts. We view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool
and do not use them for speculative or trading purposes.

Based on our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to derivative foreign currency
instruments outstanding at June 27, 2003, a 10% uniform strengthening in the value of the U.S.
dollar relative to the currencies in which those derivative foreign currency instruments are
denominated would result in an increase in fair value of approximately $2 million.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the reported amounts of the Company’s
assets, liabilities and operations. For purposes of quantifying the risk associated with fluctuations in
the foreign exchange rate as shown below, a hypothetical 10% detrimental change in foreign

78


-----

exchange rates on assets, liabilities and sales denominated in foreign currencies was assumed for all
exchange rates as of and for the four months ended June 27, 2003. The Company’s material
exposures to foreign exchange rate fluctuations primarily relate to the Euro and British Pound, among
other currencies. Based on sales volume, approximately 15% and 46% of the Company’s
international operations were conducted in the U.K. and countries that have adopted the Euro as
their transactional currency, respectively.

The table below presents the hypothetical impact of an assumed 10% unfavorable change in all
exchange rates to which we are exposed on total assets, total liabilities and sales:


**10% decrease in value**
**of local currencies**
**vs. the U.S. dollar**


**(Dollars in millions)**


**Balance as of and for the**
**four months ended**
**June 27, 2003**


Total Assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $9,744 $8,337
Total Liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $8,477 $8,024
Sales . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $3,917 $3,652

At June 27, 2003, approximately 46% of our total debt was at variable interest rates. We are required
under our senior credit facilities to maintain appropriate interest protection and other hedging
arrangements so that at least 50% of our consolidated indebtedness will effectively bear interest at a
fixed rate for a period of three years. Exclusive of the effects of these hedging arrangements, based
on our interest rate exposure on variable rate borrowings outstanding at June 27, 2003, a
one-percentage-point increase in the average interest rate would increase future interest expense by
approximately $16 million per year.

Our sensitivity analyses of the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange
rates do not reflect the effect of such changes on the related hedged transactions or on other
operating transactions. The analyses also do not factor in a potential change in the level of variable
rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical
conditions prevailed.

#### Environmental matters

A reserve estimate for each environmental matter is established using standard engineering cost
estimating techniques on an undiscounted basis. In the determination of such costs, consideration is
given to the professional judgment of our environmental engineers, in consultation with outside
environmental specialists, when necessary. At multi-party sites, the reserve estimate also reflects
the expected allocation of total project costs among the various potentially responsible parties. At
June 27, 2003, we had reserves for environmental matters of $101 million.

We do not believe that compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations will have a
material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. Our capital
expenditures for environmental control facilities during 2003 and 2004 are not expected to be
material to us. We believe that any liability that may result from the resolution of environmental
matters for which sufficient information is available to support cost estimates will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, we cannot predict the effect
on our financial position of expenditures for aspects of certain matters for which there is insufficient
information. In addition, we cannot predict the effect of compliance with environmental laws and
regulations with respect to unknown environmental matters on our financial position or results of
operations or the possible effect of compliance with environmental requirements imposed in the
future. In connection with the Acquisition, Northrop Grumman has agreed to indemnify us for 50% of
any environmental liabilities associated with the operation or ownership of TRW’s automotive
business existing at or prior to the Acquisition, subject to certain exceptions. See ‘‘The Acquisition.’’

#### Contingencies

Various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings are pending or threatened against us or our
subsidiaries, covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business
activities with respect to commercial, product liability and environmental matters.

In October 2000, Kelsey-Hayes Company (formerly known as Fruehauf Corporation) was served with
a grand jury subpoena relating to a criminal investigation being conducted by the U.S. Attorney for
the Southern District of Illinois. The U.S. Attorney has informed us that the investigation relates to
possible wrongdoing by Kelsey-Hayes Company and others involving certain loans made by
Kelsey-Hayes Company’s then parent corporation to Fruehauf Trailer Corporation, the handling of the
trailing liabilities of Fruehauf Corporation and actions in connection with the 1996 bankruptcy of
Fruehauf Trailer Corporation.

Kelsey-Hayes Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of TRW upon TRW’s acquisition of Lucas
Varity in 1999 and became our wholly-owned subsidiary in connection with the Acquisition. We have
cooperated with the investigation and are unable to predict the outcome of the investigation at this
time.

On May 6, 2002, ArvinMeritor Inc. filed suit against TRW in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Michigan, claiming breach of contract and breach of warranty in connection with
certain tie rod ends that TRW supplied to ArvinMeritor and the voluntary recall of some of these tie
rod ends. ArvinMeritor subsequently recalled all of the tie rod ends, and claims that it is entitled to
reimbursement from TRW for the costs associated with both the products recalled by TRW and those
recalled by ArvinMeritor on its own. ArvinMeritor is seeking $18.3 million in damages plus legal fees,
administrative expenses and interest. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to
defend vigorously the claims asserted against us, but cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit.

On October 1, 2002, International Truck & Engine Corporation notified the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, or NHTSA, of a program to affect a voluntary safety recall of hydraulic anti-lock
brake systems electronic control units manufactured by Kelsey-Hayes Company. On October 1, 2002,
International Truck’s parent company filed a current report on Form 8-K in which it disclosed that it
seeks to recover costs associated with its voluntary recall from the manufacturer of the electronic
control units and indicated that it expects to record a pre-tax charge of approximately $51 million for
estimated recall costs. On October 3, 2002, Kelsey-Hayes Company filed a declaratory judgment
action against International Truck in the Circuit Court for the County of Oakland, Michigan seeking a
judgment declaring that International Truck has no right to recover any of the costs associated with
the voluntary recall. On November 22, 2002, International Truck filed an answer and counterclaim.
On December 20, 2002, Kelsey-Hayes Company filed an answer to the counterclaims of
International Truck & Engine Corporation. The parties reached an agreement to settle this dispute on
September 10, 2003, and the settlement does not have a material effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

On December 30, 2002, Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. and Koyo Delaware, Inc. filed a complaint against
TRW and its then wholly-owned subsidiary, TRW Automotive Holding Company, in the Circuit Court
for Monroe County, Tennessee, alleging that TRW violated certain nonassignment and other
provisions of a 1988 partnership agreement with Koyo, under which the parties formed TKS, by
agreeing to be merged into Northrop Grumman and by cooperating with Northrop Grumman in
preparing for the spin-off of TRW’s automotive business or the sale of that business to BCP
Acquisition Company L.L.C., an entity controlled by Blackstone. The complaint included claims for
breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of good faith and fair dealing. It sought
declaratory relief consisting of an injunction prohibiting the defendants from including the partnership
interest held by TRW Automotive Holding Company in any sale or transfer to Blackstone and from
disclosing Koyo trade secrets to third parties, orders terminating defendants’ participation in the
partnership and requiring defendants to sell their partnership interest to Koyo and damages. On
January 21, 2003, TRW and TRW Automotive Holding Company filed a motion to dismiss or for
summary judgment. On February 21, 2003, the Circuit Court for Monroe County, Tennessee, issued a
temporary injunction prohibiting the sale to any entity controlled by Blackstone, of the partnership

-----

interest held by TRW Automotive Holding Company, in TKS, pending the final hearing of the matter.
On March 7, 2003, Koyo Seiko filed a cross motion for partial summary judgment seeking a
permanent injunction and other relief. On July 30, 2003, the court issued an order, which enjoined
TRW and its subsidiaries and affiliates from: (i) selling or transferring all or any part of its partnership
interest in TKS to Blackstone; (ii) assigning all or part of its rights under the TKS Partnership
Agreement to Blackstone; and (iii) delegating all or part of its obligations under the TKS Partnership
Agreement to Blackstone. We have been informed that Northrop Grumman has reached an
agreement with Koyo Seiko to sell the 51% interest in TKS to Koyo Seiko.

While certain of our subsidiaries have been subject in recent years to asbestos-related claims, we
believe that such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations. In general, these claims seek damages for illnesses alleged to have resulted from
exposure to asbestos used in certain components sold by our subsidiaries. We believe that the
majority of the claimants were assembly workers at the major U.S. automobile manufacturers. The
vast majority of these claims name as defendants numerous manufacturers and suppliers of a wide
variety of products allegedly containing asbestos. We believe that, to the extent any of the products
sold by our subsidiaries and at issue in these cases contained asbestos, the asbestos was
encapsulated. Based upon several years of experience with such claims, we believe that only a small
proportion of the claimants has or will ever develop any asbestos-related impairment.

Neither our settlement costs in connection with asbestos claims nor our average annual legal fees to
defend these claims have been material in the past. These claims are strongly disputed by us and it
has been our policy to defend against them aggressively. We have been successful in obtaining the
dismissal of many cases without any payment whatsoever. Moreover, there is significant insurance
coverage with solvent carriers with respect to these claims. However, while our costs to defend and
settle these claims in the past have not been material, we cannot assure you that this will remain so
in the future.

We believe that the ultimate resolution of the foregoing matters will not have a material effect on our
financial condition or results of operations.

#### Recent accounting pronouncements

The FASB recently issued the following accounting pronouncements applicable to us:

� SFAS No. 141, ‘‘Business Combinations’’ (‘‘SFAS 141’’);

� SFAS No. 142, ‘‘Goodwill and Intangible Assets’’ (‘‘SFAS 142’’);

� SFAS No. 143, ‘‘Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations’’ (‘‘SFAS 143’’);

� SFAS No. 144, ‘‘Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets’’ (‘‘SFAS
144’’);

� SFAS No. 145, ‘‘Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections’’ (‘‘SFAS 145’’);

� SFAS No. 146, ‘‘Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities’’ (‘‘SFAS
146’’);

� SFAS No. 149, ‘‘Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities’’ (‘‘SFAS 149’’);

� SFAS No. 150, ‘‘Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both
Liabilities and Equity’’ (‘‘SFAS 150’’);

� FASB Interpretation No. 45, ‘‘Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others’’ (‘‘FIN 45’’); and

� FASB Interpretation No. 46, ‘‘Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities’’ (‘‘FIN 46’’).

SFAS 141 requires that acquisitions entered into after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the
purchase method and establishes criteria to be used in determining whether acquired intangible

81


-----

assets are to be recorded separately from goodwill. SFAS 142 sets forth the accounting for goodwill
and intangible assets after the completion of a business acquisition and for goodwill and intangible
assets already recorded. Beginning January 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer amortized. Rather,
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the asset’s fair value to its carrying value. In addition,
the value of workforce of approximately $15 million was reclassified from intangible assets to
goodwill. We adopted SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The following table reflects the reconciliation of
reported net earnings (losses) to adjusted net earnings for the exclusion of goodwill amortization.

**Predecessor** **Successor**

**Six** **Two** **Four months**

Adjusted net earnings (losses) . . . . . . $144 $ 28 $164 $140 $31 $(51)

SFAS 143 requires the fair value of a liability for asset retirement obligations to be recorded in the
period in which it is incurred. The statement applies to a company’s legal or contractual obligation
associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that resulted from the acquisition,
construction or development or through the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The statement
was effective as of January 1, 2003. The Predecessor adopted SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and
the adoption did not have a material impact on the combined financial statements.

SFAS 144 addresses the accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets. The statement provides a consistent method to value long-lived assets to be disposed of.
New criteria must be met to classify the asset as an asset held-for-sale. This statement also changes
the rules for reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business. The Predecessor adopted
SFAS 144 on January 1, 2002. Adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on its or
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145 which requires gains and losses on extinguishments of
debt to be reclassified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary
items as previously required by SFAS 4, ‘‘Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt.’’
SFAS 145 also amends SFAS 13 requiring certain modifications to capital leases to be treated as
sale-leaseback transactions and to subleases when the original lessee remains a secondary obligor,
or guarantor. The Predecessor adopted the provisions of SFAS 145 related to the rescission of
SFAS 4 on January 1, 2003. In the first quarter of 2002, the Predecessor completed an unsolicited
repurchase of £5.4 million (approximately $8 million) of the 10.875% debentures issued by a
subsidiary due 2020. The repurchase resulted in an extraordinary gain of $4 million before taxes and
$2 million after taxes. The extraordinary gain recorded for the extinguishment of debt in the first
quarter of 2002 has been reclassified into earnings in the accompanying financial statements. The
remaining provisions of SFAS 145 were effective for transactions and reporting subsequent to May
15, 2002 and were adopted by the Predecessor as of that date. The adoption of these provisions did
not have a material impact on the Predecessor’s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, which requires that a liability for costs associated with exit
or disposal activities be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than when an entity commits
to an exit plan. SFAS 146 also provides that the liability be initially measured at fair value. The
Predecessor adopted SFAS 146 on January 1, 2003, and we believe the adoption of this statement
did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

82


-----

In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45, which expands the existing disclosure requirements for
most guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at
the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair
value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its
interim and annual financial statements. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of
FIN 45 apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The
disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after
December 15, 2002. The adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on the
Predecessor’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, which addresses when a company should include in its
financial statements the assets, liabilities and activities of another entity. FIN 46 requires
consolidation of a variable interest entity if the reporting entity is subject to a majority of the risk of
loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the variable interest
entity’s residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply immediately to
variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to
older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain disclosure
requirements apply in all financial statements initially issued after January 31, 2003. The adoption of
FIN 46 is not expected to have a material impact on the Predecessor’s or our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, which requires contracts with comparable characteristics
to be accounted for similarly, and is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30,
2003, as well as for hedging relationships designated after that date. We will adopt SFAS 149 as of
the beginning of the fiscal quarter ending September 26, 2003, and do not expect the adoption of this
standard to have a material impact on our reported financial position of results of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, which clarifies the accounting for certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires that those instruments be
classified as liabilities in statements of financial position. Previously, many of those financial
instruments were classified as equity. SFAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003 and other provisions are effective at the beginning of the first interim
period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 had no impact on the Successor’s
financial position.

## Industry overview

The statements regarding industry outlook, trends, the future development of certain automotive
systems and other non-historical statements contained in this section are forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, all of which are
out of our control, and some of which are described in the ‘‘Risk factors’’ section.

#### Industry trends

**_Focus on safety._**

Consumers, and therefore VMs, are increasingly focused on, and governments are increasingly
requiring, improved safety in vehicles. Advances in technology by us and others have led to a
number of innovations in our product portfolio, such as electronic vehicle stability control systems, tire
pressure monitoring systems, occupant sensing systems, rollover sensing and curtain air bag
systems.

**_Globalization of suppliers._**

To serve multiple markets more cost effectively, many VMs are manufacturing global vehicle
platforms, which typically are designed in one location but are produced and sold in many different
geographic markets around the world. Having operations in the geographic markets in which VMs
produce global platforms enables suppliers to meet VMs’ needs more economically and efficiently.
Few suppliers have this global coverage, and it is a source of significant competitive advantage for
those suppliers that do.

**_Shift of engineering to suppliers._**

Increasingly, VMs are focusing their efforts on consumer brand development and overall vehicle
design, as opposed to the design of individual vehicle systems. In order to simplify the vehicle design
and assembly processes and reduce their costs, VMs increasingly look to their suppliers to provide
fully engineered, pre-assembled combinations of components in systems and modules rather than
individual components. As a result, Tier-1 suppliers are gaining increased access to confidential
planning information regarding VMs’ future vehicle designs and manufacturing processes. Systems
and modules increase the importance of Tier-1 suppliers because they generally increase the Tier-1
suppliers’ percentage of vehicle content.

**_Increased electronic content and electronics integration._**

The electronic content of vehicles has been increasing and, we believe, will continue to increase in
the future. The increase in electronic content is largely driven by consumer and regulatory
requirements in Europe and the United States for improved automotive safety and environmental
performance, as well as consumer demand for increased vehicle performance and functionality at
lower cost. Electronics integration, which generally refers to replacing mechanical with electronic
components and integration of mechanical and electrical functions within the vehicle, allows VMs to
achieve a reduction in the weight of vehicles and the number of mechanical parts, resulting in easier
assembly, enhanced fuel economy, improved emissions control, increased safety and better vehicle
performance. As consumers seek more competitively-priced ride and handling performance, safety,
security and convenience options in vehicles, such as electronic stability control, active cruise control,
air bags, keyless entry and tire pressure monitoring, we believe that electronic content per vehicle
will continue to increase.

**_Increased emphasis on speed-to-market._**

As VMs are under increasing pressure to adjust to changing consumer preferences and to
incorporate technological advances, they are shortening product development times. Shorter product
development times also generally reduce product development costs. Suppliers that are able to
deliver new products to VMs in a timely fashion to accommodate the VMs’ needs will be well
positioned to succeed in this evolving marketplace.

84


-----

**_Ongoing automotive supplier consolidation._**

The worldwide automotive parts industry is consolidating as suppliers seek to achieve operating
synergies through business combinations, shift production to locations with more flexible work rules
and practices, acquire complementary technologies, build stronger customer relationships and follow
their customers as they expand globally. The need for suppliers to provide VMs with single-point
sourcing of integrated systems and modules on a global basis has helped drive industry
consolidation. Furthermore, the cost focus of most major VMs has forced suppliers to reduce costs
and improve productivity on an ongoing basis, including by achieving economies of scale through
consolidation.

#### Automobile and light truck markets

The automobile industry is characterized by short-term volatility, but long-term growth of light vehicle
sales and production. New vehicle demand is driven by macro-economic and other factors such as
interest-rates, manufacturer and dealer sales incentives, fuel prices, consumer confidence and
employment and income growth trends. These factors ultimately determine longer-term vehicle
production and sales rates.

The table below shows recent light vehicle production trends in both North America and Europe
based on data complied by J.D. Powers & Associates for 1998 through 2002:


**1999** **2000** **2001** **2001** **2002**


North American light vehicle production
(in millions) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15.5 17.0 17.1 15.5 16.4
% Growth . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (0.4)% 10.0% 0.9% (9.7)% 5.6%
European light vehicle production
(in millions) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18.8 19.1 19.5 19.5 19.2
% Growth . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.3% 1.8% 2.3% (0.4)% (1.2)%

As shown in the table above, production levels in 2002 in both North America and Europe were
below record levels which were achieved in 2000 in both North America and Europe. The growth
trends of North America and Europe are not always correlated. For instance, from 2000 to 2001, light
vehicle production fell by 9.7% in North America but was flat in Europe. Conversely, from 2001 to
2002, light vehicle production rose by 5.6% in North America but declined in Europe by 1.2%.

#### Braking systems

**_Foundation brakes_**

Automotive foundation braking systems today are hydraulically actuated. The most common brake
configuration today is a front disk brake, paired with a rear drum brake or a rear disc brake.
Currently, there are three basic types of braking systems under consideration for the foreseeable
future. These are conventional hydraulic brake systems, hybrid electro-hydraulic brake systems and
fully electronic braking systems (also known as ‘‘brake-by-wire’’). Currently, hydraulic brake systems
make up substantially all of the market, with hybrid electro-hydraulic brake systems just beginning to
be used on vehicles.

Traditional hydraulic brake systems use a master cylinder consisting of a piston, fluid reservoir and
most often a vacuum assist booster mounted on an assembly that is directly connected to the brake
pedal of the vehicle. When the driver pushes on the pedal, the piston is actuated, and hydraulic
brake fluid is delivered under high pressure to each wheel brake via a series of tubes and hoses
under the vehicle. VMs and brake suppliers are pursuing the development of electronic braking
systems in which hydraulic components would be replaced with electronic devices that would apply
the brakes as required for whatever control is necessary. Due to the wide range of mass of vehicles,
as well as cost and performance demands of a fully electronic system, a practical fully-electronic
alternative is not yet available.

85


-----

**_ABS_**

Approximately 70% to 75% of braking systems in new vehicles in North America and Europe are
fitted with ABS, which adds electronically-controlled inlet- and outlet-valves, a pump, a low pressure
accumulator and an electronic controller to provide added safety by preventing wheel lock-up during
heavy braking or slippery conditions. Cars equipped with ABS have the ABS installed between the
master cylinder and the wheel brakes. Studies are currently underway in Europe and the United
States to determine whether to require mandatory installation of ABS.

VSC is a relatively new advanced safety feature which builds on the technology of ABS. VSC
monitors steering angles, transverse acceleration, yaw, wheel speed and brake pressure to detect
loss of traction. When wheels begin to lose traction causing the vehicle to become less stable, VSC
can reduce engine power or apply brake pressure as required to maintain the vehicle’s intended
path. The installation rate for VSC is increasing significantly, and VSC systems carry significantly
higher content per vehicle.

**Steering systems**

The power steering market is undergoing a similar technological transition from a hydraulic-based
system towards a fully electronic system (also known as ‘‘steer-by-wire’’). A primary driver behind this
evolution is an attempt to reduce reliance on the engine in order to improve fuel economy and
emissions performance.

Power steering systems are transitioning from hydraulic-based systems into a combination of
electrically powered hydraulic steering systems (EPHS) and electrically assisted power steering
systems (EPS), the application of which on particular vehicles will depend on a number of factors
including vehicle size and weight and VM preferences. VMs and steering suppliers are pursuing the
development of electronic steering systems where no mechanical connection between the steering
wheel and wheel exists. Like brake-by-wire, due to the wide range of mass of vehicles, as well as
cost and performance demands of a fully-electronic system, a practical fully-electronic alternative is
not yet available.

EPHS applications simply use a hydraulically assisted rack and pinion design where the hydraulic
assist comes from an electric motor driven pump, rather than a pump driven by the vehicle’s engine.
EPHS eliminates belts, pulleys and all direct connection with the engine, combining an advanced
brushless motor, hydraulic power steering pump, electronic unit and reservoir into a single module.
This system offers enhanced fuel efficiency because it consumes power only when steering assist is
required.

In the case of EPS, the electric-motor power assist provides direct response to steering and
hydraulics are eliminated. EPS systems come in several varieties. Currently, the majority of EPS
applications have utilized the column drive approach, in which the motor is part of the steering
column assembly and is housed in the vehicle’s passenger compartment behind the instrument
panel. Alternatives utilize rack-drives and pinon-drives. In the rack-drive approach, the motor is
housed under the vehicle on or near the rack itself. In the pinion-drive approach, the motor is housed
outside the passenger compartment, but on the pinion.

Most of the movement away from hydraulic power steering systems to EPHS and EPS has been
taking place in Europe and Japan, driven by demand for lower emissions and improved fuel
economy. The competitive pressures imposed by the introduction of these vehicles to the market are
beginning to be felt in North America and the rest of the world as well, as some of the benefits from
these systems are beginning to be realized.

#### Occupant safety

Vehicle occupant safety systems are continuing to evolve and become more technically
sophisticated, driven by consumer pressure for increased occupant safety in vehicles, as well as
newly legislated standards defining smarter air bag and occupant safety systems. Currently, seat

86


-----

belts, along with driver and passenger airbags, are standard equipment on substantially all new
passenger cars and light trucks. Additional features are being added to make the air bags and seat
belts smarter in how they deploy and protect the occupants. These developments are creating
additional demand for technology to manage this complexity.

Current and expected market trends in the occupant safety market include the increasing demand
for, and application of, seat belt pretensioners; side impact air bags; curtain airbags (which improve
head protection in side impact and roll-over situations); specialty air bags; multi-stage frontal air bags
(which require dual stage inflators and multi-threshold crash sensors) and occupant sensing systems.

## Business

#### Overview

We are among the world’s largest and most diversified suppliers of automotive systems, modules and
components to global VMs and related aftermarkets. We conduct substantially all of our operations
through our subsidiaries. We believe we have leading market positions in our primary business lines,
which encompass the design, manufacture and sale of active and passive safety related products.
Active safety related products principally refer to vehicle dynamic controls (primarily braking and
steering), and passive safety related products principally refer to occupant restraints (primarily air
bags and seat belts) and crash sensors. We are primarily a ‘‘Tier-1’’ supplier, with over 85% of our
sales in 2002 made directly to VMs and approximately 7% sold in the worldwide aftermarket for VM
service and replacement parts and the balance sold primarily to other parts suppliers for use in their
systems. Our products are primarily used in the manufacture of light vehicles, consisting of
passenger cars and light trucks (which includes vans and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs)). Our products
were on all of the ten highest volume light vehicle automotive platforms in the world in 2002. Our pro
forma sales and pro forma EBITDA, as defined, and pro forma net earnings were approximately
$10.4 billion, $1.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002 and
approximately $5.8 billion and $0.6 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively, for the six months ended
June 27, 2003. See note (2) in ‘‘Summary––Summary historical and pro forma financial data’’ for a
reconciliation of EBITDA to net earnings and ‘‘Unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated
statements of operations.’’

We have become a leader in the global automotive parts industry by capitalizing on the strength of
our products, technological capabilities and systems integration skills. We believe that we have a top
three market position in each of the following product lines: foundation brakes, ABS, steering gears
and systems, seat belts, air bags and engine valves. In the aggregate, these product lines accounted
for approximately 61% of our 2002 sales. Over the last decade, we have experienced substantial
sales growth in many of these product lines due to an increasing focus by both governments and
consumers on safety and fuel efficiency. We believe that this trend is continuing, as evidenced by
ongoing regulatory activities, and will enable us to experience significant growth in the most recent
generation of advanced safety and fuel efficient products, such as VSC, curtain air bags, occupant
sensing systems and electrically assisted power steering systems. See ‘‘—Regulatory environment.’’
Throughout our long history as a leading supplier to major VMs, we have focused on products where
we believe we have a technological advantage. We have extensive technical experience in a broad
range of product lines and strong systems integration skills, which enable us to provide
comprehensive, systems-based solutions for our VM customers.

We have established a broad global presence, with a workforce of approximately 62,000 employees
and a network of manufacturing facilities, technical centers, sales offices and joint ventures located in
every major vehicle producing region of the world. We have 145 wholly-owned manufacturing
facilities and 20 joint-venture facilities in 22 countries. We sell to all the major VMs across the world’s
major vehicle producing regions. Among our largest customers are Ford Motor Company,
DaimlerChrysler AG, General Motors Corporation, Volkswagen AG and Renault-Nissan BV. Our
geographic breakdown of sales is among the most diverse in the industry, with approximately 49% of
our 2002 sales derived from North America, 43% from Europe and 8% from the rest of the world. No
single customer accounted for more than 20% of our 2002 sales, which, we believe, is among the
lowest customer concentration levels of major global Tier-1 suppliers. The following charts illustrate
our diversity by providing a breakdown of our 2002 sales by product lines and by VM groups.*

#### Our competitive strengths

We intend to leverage our leading market positions, global presence, strong customer relationships
and diverse product capabilities to increase our presence in the global automotive parts industry.

   - **_Leading market positions. We are one of the world’s largest suppliers of automotive_**
chassis and occupant safety products. We believe that our leading supply position across a
number of product lines increases our importance to our VM customers and allows us to
compete effectively in each of the markets that we serve. We believe that we have leading
market positions in North America and Europe for substantially all of our principal product
lines.

   - **_Global presence with diversified businesses. As VMs increasingly become more global,_**
they favor suppliers that can deliver products with consistent technology and quality for
vehicles which are manufactured and sold in markets around the world. We believe our
geographically diverse global manufacturing base offers us an advantage over many of our
competitors in meeting the global needs of our VM customers. We also believe that our
global presence allows us to leverage sales to a customer in one location, or for one product,
into sales to that customer in other locations and for other products. For example, building

90


-----

upon our prior relationship of selling steering products, foundation brakes and other products
to Volkswagen AG, we were recently awarded our first Volkswagen ABS contract.
Additionally, our presence in markets such as South America, Eastern Europe and the Asia
Pacific region presents a long-term growth opportunity as demand for automotive vehicles
increases, and automotive manufacturers expand production, in these markets.
Approximately 49% of our 2002 sales were derived from sales in North America, 43% from
sales in Europe and 8% from sales in the rest of the world. No single product line accounted
for more than 14% of our 2002 sales, and no single customer accounted for more than 20%
of our 2002 sales, which, we believe, is among the lowest customer concentration levels of
major global Tier-1 suppliers. We believe our diversified business limits our exposure to the
risks of any one geographic economy, product line or major customer.

   - **_Strong relationships with customers. As a result of our focus on providing high quality_**
products and service at competitive prices, we maintain long-standing relationships with our
customers, which include every major VM in the world. Our roots in the automotive supply
business stretch back to the early 1900s, when our predecessor companies began
manufacturing valves, wheels and electrical components and selling them to the burgeoning
automobile industry. We believe that we have an excellent reputation with our customers for
providing top quality components and systems, as well as for timely delivery and customer
service. As a result of our service and performance record, since the beginning of 2001, we
have won a number of awards from our customers, including Ford’s Q1 and Q1 Plus World
Excellence, DaimlerChrysler’s Gold Pentastar, GM’s Supplier of the Year, Renault’s Trophe
OPTIMA, Toyota’s Quality Certification Achievement and Fiat’s Targa Qualitas.

   - **_Well positioned for convergence of active and passive safety technologies. We believe_**
that we are the only supplier that combines a broad customer base and geographic diversity
with leading positions in both key active safety technologies, such as braking and steering,
and key passive safety technologies, such as air bags and seat belts. We believe that there
are significant opportunities to enhance automotive safety through technology that uses
information from active safety systems to optimize the performance of passive safety
systems, and that our leading positions in both active and passive safety technologies will
allow us to benefit from this convergence. An example of this trend is our Active Control
Retractor (ACR) seat belt technology, which is used in the 2003 model year Mercedes
S-Class. The ACR system uses information from braking sensors and stability control
sensors to react quickly to potentially hazardous driving situations. If the sensors detect a
potential crash, the system automatically tightens the seat belts in order to improve the
occupants’ positions, which can significantly enhance the overall performance of the vehicle
restraint system.

   - **_Strong base of awarded business. Based on the existing platforms for which we currently_**
produce products and business awarded to us over the past several years, we believe we
will be able to grow our sales over the next several years at a rate higher than the growth
rate in global light vehicle production over the same period of time due to an increase in our
market shares and/or an increase in the content per vehicle of certain product lines in our
portfolio. Our ability to realize future sales, however, is subject to a number of factors,
including the actual volume and timing of vehicle production, option mix and product pricing.

#### Our strategy

We intend to increase our sales and improve our profitability and operating cash flow by leveraging
our position as a leading Tier-1 global automotive parts supplier focused primarily in the areas of
active and passive safety technologies. Key elements of our strategy, which we expect will help
increase our product content per vehicle, include the following:

   - **_Expand our leading technological capabilities. We believe that our leading market_**
positions are largely based on the strength of our technological capabilities. We continue to
provide technologically advanced products by regularly updating and enhancing our product

lines and introducing new products, such as electrically powered hydraulic steering systems,
electrically assisted power steering systems, electronic vehicle stability control systems, side
and curtain air bag systems and occupant sensing systems. For example, in the case of
electrically powered hydraulic steering systems and electrically assisted power steering
systems, we believe that our technological capabilities have helped us achieve a higher
market share of these new technologies than we have in traditional hydraulic-based power
steering systems. We expect to continue to make significant investments in technology and
our design capabilities in an effort to develop innovative, value-added safety technologies
with a focus on the development of next generation safety systems.

   - **_Focus on operating efficiency. We continue to focus on opportunities to optimize our_**
resources and reduce manufacturing costs by, among other things, executing strategic
initiatives aimed at improving our operating performance and shifting production capacity
from high wage areas such as North America and Western Europe to low wage areas such
as Latin America, Eastern Europe and certain parts of Asia. For example, in 2001, we began
to implement Six Sigma, a leading quality improvement program, throughout our operations
and functions. In addition, we focus on realizing cost savings in the purchase of
manufactured components and raw materials and achieving benefits from our restructuring
activities to help us offset the impact of price decreases to our VM customers.

   - **_Capitalize on the continued trend toward system and module supply. VMs are_**
increasingly purchasing integrated systems and modules from suppliers rather than
purchasing and assembling the separate components that are included in those systems and
modules. In order to capitalize on this trend, we have developed, and continue to develop,
significant system and module capabilities in a number of key product areas including air bag
systems, seat belt systems, ride and handling systems, electrically assisted power steering
systems and safety electronics systems. An example of our systems capabilities is the
occupant restraint system we designed for the Mercedes M-Class, which consists of the
driver air bag, passenger air bag, side air bags, curtain air bags, seat belts and steering
wheel. As an example of our module capabilities, we serve as module integrator for the Jeep
Liberty. In this role, we assemble braking, steering and axle modules incorporating product
content manufactured both by us and other component suppliers and deliver them to
DaimlerChrysler for installation in a just-in-time fashion, enabling it to reduce production
costs. We intend to focus on manufacturing those systems and modules where we enjoy a
competitive advantage and can add the most value, while reducing our participation and
capital spending in those areas that are non-essential to our growth and profitability.

   - **_Pursue joint ventures and other alliances. Joint ventures and other alliances represent an_**
important element of our business plan. We intend to continue pursuing joint ventures and
other alliances in order to expand our geographic and customer diversity. These relationships
have enabled us to enter into new geographic markets, such as China, Korea, India and
Turkey, to acquire new customers and to develop new technologies. We currently have 20
joint ventures in 10 countries. We are disciplined, financially and strategically, in our
approach to evaluating joint ventures and other alliance opportunities.

In addition to those risks described in the section entitled ‘‘Risk factors,’’ our ability to execute our
strategies described above is subject to certain risks that are generally associated with being a Tier-1
automotive supplier. For example, as we continue to invest time and resources to expand and
advance our leading technologies, unforeseen competing and/or alternative technologies could
emerge that render our technologies less desirable or obsolete. In addition, customer markets for our
new technologies might not develop as expected, making it difficult for us to recover our development
costs. Inherent in the trend toward increasing systems and modules is the difficulty in effectively
identifying and recovering from customers the value associated with the systems and modules that
we provide to them. This difficulty, together with the growing trend among VMs to look to their
suppliers for contribution when VMs are faced with product liability, warranty and recall claims, could
place higher pressure on our margins. Increasing operating efficiencies by moving to lower wage

countries has the potential to stretch and thus put strain on regional and global supply chains,
especially if infrastructures in these countries are not fully developed. Joint ventures and strategic
alliances have been and will continue to be important to achieving our growth objectives, but without
sufficient resources to support their development and growth, these joint ventures and strategic
alliances could fall short of meeting customers’ demands in local markets, thereby adversely affecting
our relationships with those customers globally.

sell these products to VM service organizations. In addition, we sell some engine valve and body
control products to independent distributors for the automotive aftermarket.

#### Joint ventures

Joint ventures represent an important part of our business, both operationally and strategically. We
have often used joint ventures to enter into new geographic markets such as China, Korea and India,
or to acquire new customers, such as Japanese VMs, or to develop new technologies, such as
electro-hydraulic steering pumps and radar sensors.

In the case of entering new geographic markets, where we have not previously established
substantial local experience and infrastructure, teaming with a local partner can reduce capital
investment by leveraging pre-existing infrastructure. In addition, local partners in these markets can
provide knowledge and insight into local customs and practices and access to local suppliers of raw
materials and components. All of these advantages can reduce the risk, and thereby enhance the
prospects for the success, of an entry into a new geographic market.

Joint ventures can also be an effective means to acquire new customers. Joint venture arrangements
can allow partners access to technology they would otherwise have to develop independently,
thereby reducing the time and cost of development. More importantly, they can provide the
opportunity to create synergies and applications of the technology that would not otherwise be
possible.

The following table shows our joint ventures in which we have a greater than 25% interest and that
generated sales in excess of $15 million in 2002:

** On June 27, 2003, we sold our 60% partnership interest in Quality Safety Systems Company (‘‘QSS’’), a Canadian joint
venture, to Tokai Rika Canada Limited, an affiliate of Tokai Rika Co., Ltd. of Japan, our former partner in QSS. QSS had
sales of $123 million in 2002 and manufactured seat belt systems.

Our partnership interest in TKS, in which we had a 51% interest, was not transferred to us as part of the Acquisition. TKS
had sales of $246 million in 2002 and produced steering gears. Therefore, while our predecessor company’s historical
financial statements include the results of TKS, our pro forma financial data reflects the elimination of the results of TKS.
See ‘‘Unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated statements of operations’’ and ‘‘—Legal proceedings.’’

#### Regulatory environment

There are numerous regulatory activities in the areas of safety and fuel efficiency that we believe will
create additional demand for products that we sell or are developing. Among these are the following:

   - **_Occupant sensing. United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 requires_**
vehicle manufacturers to install occupant weight and position sensing systems on vehicles
starting in model year 2004. We have developed occupant sensing systems based on both
weight sensing and vision systems.

   - **_Tire pressure monitoring. Regulations enacted under the Transportation Recall_**
Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation (‘‘TREAD’’) Act require installation of tire
pressure monitoring systems starting in model year 2004. We have developed both direct
and indirect tire pressure monitoring systems. Direct systems measure tire pressure through
sensors located on the wheels, whereas indirect systems estimate tire pressure differences
based on data from the wheel speed sensors used in ABS systems.

   - **_Rollover testing. As required by the TREAD Act, the National Highway Traffic Safety_**
Administration is considering whether to require dynamic rollover testing for passenger cars
and light trucks. We have developed roll control systems and vehicle stability control systems
that reduce the likelihood of vehicle rollover. We have also developed curtain air bags that
can reduce the severity of injury in the event of rollover.

   - **_Fuel economy. The Bush administration has proposed increases in standards for fuel_**
economy for light trucks for model years 2005-2007. If enacted, this could increase demand
for our electrically-powered hydraulic steering systems, which require less power from an
engine, and consequently less fuel, than today’s conventional hydraulic systems.

   - **_ABS installation. Studies are underway in Europe and the United States to determine_**
whether to require mandatory installation of ABS. At present, approximately 75% of new
vehicles in North America and 70% of new vehicles in Europe are installed with ABS.

99


-----

   - **_Pedestrian protection. Legislation is under consideration in Europe and Japan to make cars_**
less dangerous to pedestrians in the event of collisions. We are investigating actuator
products which lift the hood in the case of a crash to meet the pedestrian in a manner which
would cushion the pedestrian’s impact with the vehicle.

Legislative activities are subject to political processes that may result in legislation being delayed,
modified, withdrawn or overturned at any time. As a result, there is no assurance that any of the
foregoing will be enacted or where legislation has been enacted, will not be subsequently modified or
rescinded in the future.

#### Competition
The automotive parts industry is extremely competitive. VMs rigorously evaluate us and other
suppliers based on many criteria such as quality, price/cost competitiveness, system and product
performance, reliability and timeliness of delivery, new product and technology development
capability, excellence and flexibility in operations, degree of global and local presence, effectiveness
of customer service and overall management capability. Within each of our product segments, we
face significant competition. Our principal competitors include Delphi, Bosch, Conti-Teves, Visteon,
Koyo Seiko, ZF, and Advics in the Chassis Systems segment; Autoliv, Delphi, Breed, Takata, and
Bosch in the Occupant Safety Systems segment; and ITW, Raymond, Nifco, Textron, Kostal, Delphi,
Valeo, Tokai Riki and Eaton in the Other Automotive segment.

#### Customers
We sell to all the major VM customers across all the world’s major vehicle producing regions. Among
our largest customers are Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler AG, General Motors Corporation,
Volkswagen AG and Renault-Nissan BV. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 80%
of our total sales in 2002. We believe that, among major automotive parts suppliers, the breadth of
our customer mix is among the industry leaders. Our long-standing relationships with our customers
have enabled us to understand global customer needs and business opportunities. We believe that
we will continue to be able to compete effectively for our customers’ business because of the high
quality of our products, our ongoing cost reduction efforts, our strong global presence and our
product and technology innovations. The chart below indicates our ten largest customers by VM
group, the VMs within each group and the percentage of total 2002 sales represented by each of
these VM groups.

**Percentage of total**
**VM Group** **VMs** **2002 Sales**

Ford Ford, Land Rover, Jaguar, Aston-Martin, Volvo, Mazda 20.0%
DaimlerChrysler Chrysler, Mercedes, Smart, Mitsubishi 18.2%
General Motors General Motors, Opel, Saab, Isuzu, Subaru 14.0%
Volkswagen Volkswagen, Audi, Seat, Skoda, Bentley 13.1%
Renault-Nissan Renault, Nissan 6.1%
Toyota* Toyota, NUMMI, Daihatsu 5.0%
Fiat Fiat, Lancia, Alfa-Romeo, Ducato 4.0%
PSA Peugeot, Citroen 2.8%
BMW BMW 1.8%
Hyundai Hyundai, Kia 1.4%

- Our 2002 sales to Toyota included sales of TKS, which was not transferred to us as part of the Acquisition. See
‘‘Unaudited pro forma combined and consolidated statements of operations’’ and ‘‘—Legal proceedings.’’
We also sell products to the global aftermarket as replacement parts for current production and older
vehicles. In 2002, sales to the aftermarket represented approximately 7% of our total sales. We sell
these products through both VM service organizations and independent distribution networks.

**Sales and marketing**

We have a sales and marketing organization of dedicated customer teams that provide a consistent
interface with our key customers. These teams are located in all major vehicle producing regions to

100


-----

best represent their respective customers’ interests within our organization, to promote customer
programs and to coordinate global customer strategies with the goal of enhancing overall customer
service and satisfaction. Our ability to support our customers globally is further enhanced by our
broad global presence in terms of sales offices, manufacturing facilities, engineering/technical centers
and joint ventures.

Our sales and marketing organization and activities are designed to create overall awareness and
consideration of, and to increase purchases of, our systems, modules and components. To further
this objective, we participate in international trade shows in Paris, Frankfurt and Detroit, as well as
international aftermarket-focused events in Las Vegas and Frankfurt. We also provide on-site
technology demonstrations at our major VM customers on a regular basis. We publish the quarterly
technology journal Advances.

#### Customer support

Our engineering, sales and production facilities are located in 22 countries. With approximately 213
sites or offices and approximately 530 dedicated sales/customer development employees, we provide
effective customer solutions, products and service in any region in which these facilities operate or
manufacture.

#### Intellectual property

We own significant intellectual property, including a large number of patents, trademarks, copyrights
and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Although our intellectual
property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets
that we serve, no single patent, copyright, trade secret or license, or group of related patents,
copyrights, trade secrets or licenses, is, in our opinion, of such value to us that our business would
be materially affected by the expiration or termination thereof. However, we view the name TRW
Automotive and primary mark ‘‘TRW’’ (which has been transferred to us as part of the Acquisition) as
material to our business as a whole. Our general policy is to apply for patents on an ongoing basis in
the United States, Germany and appropriate other countries to protect our patentable developments.

Our patent portfolio of nearly 10,000 patents and pending patent applications reflects our
commitment to invest in technology and covers many aspects of our products and the processes for
making those products. In addition, we have developed a substantial body of manufacturing
know-how that we believe provides a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace.

We have entered into several hundred technology license agreements that either strategically exploit
our intellectual property rights or provide a conduit for us into third party intellectual property rights
useful in our businesses. In many of these agreements, we license technology to our suppliers, joint
venture companies and other local manufacturers in support of product production for us and our
customers. In other agreements, we license the technology to other companies to obtain royalty
income.

We own a number of secondary trade names and marks applicable to certain of our businesses and
products that we view as important to such businesses and products as well.

As part of the Acquisition, we have entered into intellectual property license agreements with TRW.
These agreements are described under ‘‘Certain relationships and related transactions.’’

#### Seasonality

Our business is moderately seasonal because our largest North American customers typically halt
operations for approximately two weeks in July and one week in December. Additionally, customers in
Europe historically shut down vehicle production during a portion of August. In addition, third quarter
automotive production traditionally is lower as new models enter production. Accordingly, our third
and fourth quarter results may reflect these trends.

#### Research and development

We operate a global network of technical centers worldwide where we employ approximately 4,200
engineers, researchers, designers, technicians and their supporting functions. This global network

101


-----

allows us to develop automotive active and passive technologies while improving existing products
and systems. We utilize sophisticated testing and computer simulation equipment, including computer
aided engineering, noise-vibration-harshness, crash sled, math modeling and vehicle simulations. We
have advanced engineering and research and development programs for next-generation
components and systems in our chassis, occupant safety and other automotive product areas. We
are disciplined in our approach to research and development, employing various tools to improve
efficiency and reduce cost, such as Six Sigma, ‘‘follow-the-sun,’’ a 24-hour a day engineering
program that utilizes our global network, and other e-Engineering programs, and outsourcing
non-core activities.

Company-funded research and development costs totaled:

   - $54 million for the four months ended June 27, 2003;

   - $27 million for the two months ended February 28, 2003;

   - $74 million for the six months ended June 28, 2002;

   - $151 million in 2002;

   - $131 million in 2001; and

   - $167 million in 2000.

In addition, in the four months ended June 27, 2003, we expensed $85 million of purchased
in-process research and development. The decline in the company-funded research and development
costs from 2000 through 2001 is primarily as a result of (1) our increased focus and discipline as to
the research and development activities we undertake, (2) cost reduction actions that we have taken
in recent years to reduce overhead costs and (3) a shift in resources to applications engineering,
which relates to applying products to fit customers’ needs. See ‘‘Management’s discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations.’’

We believe that continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our
leadership position in the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek
additional business with new and existing customers.

#### Manufactured components and raw materials

We purchase various manufactured components and raw materials for use in our manufacturing
processes. The principal components and raw materials we purchase include castings, electronic
parts, molded plastic parts, finished subcomponents, fabricated metal, aluminum, steel, resins,
leather and wood. All of these components and raw materials are available from numerous sources.
We have not, in recent years, experienced any significant shortages of manufactured components or
raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of these items in excess of those reasonably
required to meet our production and shipping schedule.

#### Properties

Our principal executive offices are located in Livonia, Michigan. Our operations include numerous
manufacturing, research and development and warehousing facilities and offices. We own or lease

#### Employees

As of June 27, 2003, we had approximately 62,000 employees (including employees of our majority
owned joint ventures but excluding temporary employees and employees who are on approved forms
of leave), of whom approximately 23,500 were employed in North America, approximately 32,000
were employed in Europe, approximately 4,000 were employed in South America and approximately
2,500 were employed in Asia. Approximately 16,000 of our employees are salaried and approximately
46,000 are hourly. As of June 27, 2003, approximately 22% of our United States workforce and
approximately 73% of our hourly workforce outside of the United States were represented by 39
unions. We consider relations with our employees to be good.

#### Environmental matters

Governmental requirements relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise
relating to the protection of the environment, have had, and will continue to have, an effect on us and
our operations. We have made and continue to make expenditures for projects relating to the
environment, including pollution control devices for new and existing facilities. We are conducting a
number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations to
comply with applicable requirements and, along with other companies, have been named a
potentially responsible party for certain waste management sites. Each of these matters is subject to
various uncertainties, and some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us.

A reserve estimate for each matter is established using standard engineering cost estimating
techniques on an undiscounted basis. In the determination of such costs, consideration is given to

103


-----

the professional judgment of our environmental engineers, in consultation with outside environmental
specialists, when necessary. At multi-party sites, the reserve estimate also reflects the expected
allocation of total project costs among the various potentially responsible parties. At June 27, 2003,
we had reserves for environmental matters of $101 million.

We do not believe that compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations will have a
material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. Our capital
expenditures for environmental control facilities during 2003 and 2004 are not expected to be
material to us. We believe that any liability that may result from the resolution of environmental
matters for which sufficient information is available to support cost estimates will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, we cannot predict the effect
on our financial position of expenditures for aspects of certain matters for which there is insufficient
information. In addition, we cannot predict the effect of compliance with environmental laws and
regulations with respect to unknown environmental matters on our financial position or results of
operations or the possible effect of compliance with environmental requirements imposed in the
future. Under the master purchase agreement, Northrop Grumman will indemnify us for 50% of any
environmental liabilities associated with the operation or ownership of TRW’s automotive business on
or prior to the Acquisition (subject to certain exceptions), regardless of whether the liabilities arise
before or after the Acquisition. See ‘‘The Acquisition.’’

#### Legal proceedings

Various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings are pending or threatened against us or our
subsidiaries, covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business
activities with respect to commercial, product liability and environmental matters.

In October 2000, Kelsey-Hayes Company (formerly known as Fruehauf Corporation) was served with
a grand jury subpoena relating to a criminal investigation being conducted by the U.S. Attorney for
the Southern District of Illinois. The U.S. Attorney has informed us that the investigation relates to
possible wrongdoing by Kelsey-Hayes Company and others involving certain loans made by
Kelsey-Hayes Company’s then parent corporation to Fruehauf Trailer Corporation, the handling of the
trailing liabilities of Fruehauf Corporation and actions in connection with the 1996 bankruptcy of
Fruehauf Trailer Corporation.

Kelsey-Hayes Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of TRW upon TRW’s acquisition of Lucas
Varity in 1999 and became our wholly-owned subsidiary in connection with the Acquisition. We have
cooperated with the investigation and are unable to predict the outcome of the investigation at this
time.

On May 6, 2002, ArvinMeritor Inc. filed suit against TRW in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Michigan, claiming breach of contract and breach of warranty in connection with
certain tie rod ends that TRW supplied to ArvinMeritor and the voluntary recall of some of these tie
rod ends. ArvinMeritor subsequently recalled all of the tie rod ends, and claims that it is entitled to
reimbursement from TRW for the costs associated with both the products recalled by TRW and those
recalled by ArvinMeritor on its own. ArvinMeritor is seeking $18.3 million in damages plus legal fees,
administrative expenses and interest. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to
defend vigorously the claims asserted against us, but cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit.

On October 1, 2002, International Truck & Engine Corporation notified the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, or NHTSA, of a program to affect a voluntary safety recall of hydraulic anti-lock
brake systems electronic control units manufactured by Kelsey-Hayes Company. On October 1, 2002,
International Truck’s parent company filed a current report on Form 8-K in which it disclosed that it
seeks to recover costs associated with its voluntary recall from the manufacturer of the electronic
control units and indicated that it expects to record a pre-tax charge of approximately $51 million for
estimated recall costs. On October 3, 2002, Kelsey-Hayes Company filed a declaratory judgment
action against International Truck in the Circuit Court for the County of Oakland, Michigan seeking a
judgment declaring that International Truck has no right to recover any of the costs associated with
the voluntary recall. On November 22, 2002, International Truck filed an answer and counterclaim.

104


-----

On December 20, 2002, Kelsey-Hayes Company filed an answer to the counterclaims of International
Truck & Engine Corporation. The parties reached an agreement to settle this dispute on
September 10, 2003 and the settlement does not have a material effect on our financial condition
results of operations or cash flows.

On December 30, 2002, Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. and Koyo Delaware, Inc. filed a complaint against
TRW and its then wholly-owned subsidiary, TRW Automotive Holding Company, in the Circuit Court
for Monroe County, Tennessee, alleging that TRW violated certain nonassignment and other
provisions of a 1988 partnership agreement with Koyo, under which the parties formed TKS, by
agreeing to be merged into Northrop Grumman and by cooperating with Northrop Grumman in
preparing for the spin-off of TRW’s automotive business or the sale of that business to BCP
Acquisition Company L.L.C., an entity controlled by Blackstone. The complaint included claims for
breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of good faith and fair dealing. It sought
declaratory relief consisting of an injunction prohibiting the defendants from including the partnership
interest held by TRW Automotive Holding Company in any sale or transfer to Blackstone and from
disclosing Koyo trade secrets to third parties, orders terminating defendants’ participation in the
partnership and requiring defendants to sell their partnership interest to Koyo and damages. On
January 21, 2003, TRW and TRW Automotive Holding Company filed a motion to dismiss or for
summary judgment. On February 21, 2003, the Circuit Court for Monroe County, Tennessee, issued a
temporary injunction prohibiting the sale to any entity controlled by Blackstone, of the partnership
interest held by TRW Automotive Holding Company, in TKS, pending the final hearing of the matter.
On March 7, 2003, Koyo Seiko filed a cross motion for partial summary judgment seeking a
permanent injunction and other relief. On July 30, 2003, the court issued an order, which enjoined
TRW and its subsidiaries and affiliates from: (i) selling or transferring all or any part of its partnership
interest in TKS to Blackstone: (ii) assigning all or part of its rights under the TKS Partnership
Agreement to Blackstone; and (iii) delegating all or part of its obligations under the TKS Partnership
Agreement to Blackstone. We have been informed that Northrop Grumman has reached an
agreement with Koyo Seiko to sell the 51% interest in TKS to Koyo Seiko.

While certain of our subsidiaries have been subject in recent years to asbestos-related claims, we
believe that such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations. In general, these claims seek damages for illnesses alleged to have resulted from
exposure to asbestos used in certain components sold by our subsidiaries. We believe that the
majority of the claimants were assembly workers at the major U.S. automobile manufacturers. The
vast majority of these claims name as defendants numerous manufacturers and suppliers of a wide
variety of products allegedly containing asbestos. We believe that, to the extent any of the products
sold by our subsidiaries and at issue in these cases contained asbestos, the asbestos was
encapsulated. Based upon several years of experience with such claims, we believe that only a small
proportion of the claimants has or will ever develop any asbestos-related impairment.

Neither our settlement costs in connection with asbestos claims nor our average annual legal fees to
defend these claims have been material in the past. These claims are strongly disputed by us and it
has been our policy to defend against them aggressively. We have been successful in obtaining the
dismissal of many cases without any payment whatsoever. Moreover, there is significant insurance
coverage with solvent carriers with respect to these claims. However, while our costs to defend and
settle these claims in the past have not been material, there can be no assurances that this will
remain so in the future.

We believe that the ultimate resolution of the foregoing matters will not have a material effect on our
financial condition or results of operations.

107


-----

#### Committees of the board of directors

Our board of directors has an audit committee and a compensation committee.

**_Audit committee_**

The audit committee is comprised of Neil P. Simpkins and Joshua H. Astrof. The audit committee is
responsible for (1) selecting the independent auditors, (2) approving the overall scope of the audit,
(3) assisting the board in monitoring the integrity of our financial statements, the independent
accountant’s qualifications and independence, the performance of the independent accountants and
our internal audit function and our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and
(4) handling such other matters that are specifically delegated to the audit committee by the board of
directors from time to time.

Mr. Simpkins has been determined by the board of directors to be an audit committee financial
expert. Mr. Simpkins, due to his affiliation with Blackstone, is not ‘‘independent’’ as such term is used
in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act.

**_Compensation committee_**

The compensation committee is comprised of Neil P. Simpkins and Mark J. Johnson. The
compensation committee is responsible for (1) reviewing key employee compensation policies, plans
and programs, (2) reviewing and approving the compensation of our executive officers, (3) reviewing
and approving employment contracts and other similar arrangements between us and our executive
officers, (4) reviewing and consulting with the chief executive officer on the selection of officers and
evaluation of executive performance and other related matters, (5) administration of stock plans and
other incentive compensation plans and (6) such other matters that are specifically delegated to the
compensation committee by the board of directors from time to time.

#### Executive compensation

As an independent company, we have established executive compensation practices that link
compensation with our performance as a company. We will continually review our executive
compensation programs to ensure that they are competitive.

**_Summary compensation table_**

The following table shows 2003 compensation information on an annual basis, to the extent that it is
currently determinable, for our Chief Executive Officer and four other most highly compensated
executive officers based on salary, whom we refer to as the ‘‘named executive officers’’. The amounts
shown for Salary and All Other Compensation represent the pro forma amounts that would have
been payable by us to the named executive officers as if the Acquisition had occurred on January 1,
2003, as well as certain payments made or expected to be made by Northrop Grumman in 2003 for
services rendered to us, as described below. Other Annual Compensation represents our estimate of
perquisites payable to the named executive officers for 2003, and Long Term Compensation
represents the options that have actually been awarded to the named executive officers to date in
2003.

(1) We have provided compensation information as to 2003 for the named executive officers because 2003 is the first year in
which we, as a newly established company following the Acquisition, are paying compensation to our named executive
officers.

(2) Under employment agreements we entered into with each of the named executive officers, such officers are eligible to
earn an annual bonus of up to a certain percentage of their base salary (200% for Mr. Plant, 130% for Mr. Lunn and 90%
for the other officers) based upon the achievement of annual net income, EBITDA and cash flow targets established by
the board of directors within the first three months of each fiscal year during the employment term. Such bonus would be
payable no later than April 15 of the year following the year in which it was earned. See ‘‘— Employment agreements.’’

(3) This represents our estimate of known perquisites which we believe would be payable to Mr. Plant for 2003 and includes
a car allowance of $36,000 for all of 2003, estimated financial planning of $25,000 and a gross-up in the amount of
$1,605,209 paid by Northrop Grumman for taxes relating to the change of control payments made to Mr. Plant in March
2003. There may be additional perquisites that may be paid to him after the date hereof.

(4) Total perquisites for each of these executive officers are expected to be less than the lesser of $50,000 or 10% of their
respective annual salary and bonus, and accordingly the dollar value of such estimated perquisites is not shown.
However, there may be additional perquisites that may be paid after the date hereof, causing the amount of total
perquisites to exceed our current estimate. Perquisites for an executive officer may, but do not necessarily, include
reimbursement for any of the following expenses: car; financial planning; income tax preparation; personal use of aircraft;
and relocation.

(5) All grants were made pursuant to the TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. 2003 Stock Incentive Plan and represent options
to purchase shares of common stock of our indirect parent, TRW Automotive Holdings. The grant date for all options was
February 28, 2003, except for a grant of options for 500 shares to Mr. Plant and 400 shares to Mr. Lunn made on
April 29, 2003. The options vest 20% on the first anniversary of the grant date and 20% on each anniversary thereafter.

(6) Includes:

   - the following amounts payable by Northrop Grumman under the retention agreements entered into with the named
executive officers within fifteen days following the six month anniversary of the Acquisition if certain conditions are
satisfied: $1.8 million (Mr. Plant); $800,000 (Mr. Lunn); and $420,000 (each of the other named executive officers);
pursuant to an agreement between us and Northrop Grumman, we made those payments on behalf of Northrop
Grumman based on Northrop Grumman’s agreement to reimburse us:

   - payments made by Northrop Grumman to Mr. Plant in March 2003 in the amount of $3,556,162 relating to a change
in control of TRW and Mr. Plant’s continued employment through the Acquisition;

   - company-paid premium of $27,600 for executive medical coverage for each of Messrs. Plant, Lake, Cantie and
Bialosky;

109

   - matching contributions under the Retirement Savings Plan for all of 2003 in the amount of $2,800 (Mr. Plant), $3,300
(Mr. Cantie) and $2,650 (Mr. Bialosky);

   - the values of certain credits for all of 2003 provided under the Benefit Equalization Plan in the amount of $37,700
(Mr. Plant), $6,450 (Mr. Cantie) and $7,100 (Mr. Bialosky) under which Plan we provide benefits substantially equal
to benefits that could not be provided under the Retirement Savings Plan because of limitations under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’); and

   - imputed income on group life insurance in the amount of $1,600 (Mr. Plant), $550 (Mr. Lake), $400 (Mr. Cantie) and
$400 (Mr. Bialosky).

(7) U.S. dollar equivalent of £433,000, based on the exchange rate at January 1, 2003 of $1.60960 = £1.00.

(1) Effective as of the closing of the Acquisition, our indirect parent established the TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. 2003
Stock Incentive Plan, which permits us to grant key employees, directors and consultants various equity-based awards,
including non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards. 120,000
shares of TRW Automotive Holdings’ common stock are reserved for issuance under the plan. Executive officers have
received grants of options to purchase shares that will vest in 20% equal annual installments over a five-year period from
the date of grant pursuant to the plan. Fifty percent of the shares subject to the options have an exercise price per share
equal to the per share acquisition price paid by Blackstone, forty percent have an exercise price at two times the
acquisition price and ten percent have an exercise price at three times the acquisition price. If the executive officer’s

110


-----

employment is terminated due to his death or ‘‘disability’’, or, in the case of Messrs. Lunn, Lake, Cantie and Bialosky, if
the executive officer’s employment is terminated by us without ‘‘cause’’ or by the executive for ‘‘good reason,’’ as such
terms are defined in the applicable option agreement, the unvested portion of each option grant will become vested and
exercisable with respect to the number of shares that otherwise would have become vested and exercisable on the next
scheduled vesting date following such termination. If, in the case of Mr. Plant, the executive officer’s employment is
terminated by us without ‘‘cause’’ or by the executive for ‘‘good reason’’, as such terms are defined in the applicable
option grant agreement, and, in the case of all the named executive officers, upon the occurrence of a ‘‘change of
control’’ as defined in the plan, the unvested portion of any option granted to an executive officer will immediately become
vested and exercisable.

(2) These values were determined based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Calculation of the Grant Date Present
Value was based on the following assumptions: Stock price at grant of $1,000; exercise of an option in the tenth year
after its grant; price volatility of 39.730%; a dividend yield of 0.000% and a risk free rate of return of 4.037% for those
options granted on February 28, 2003 and 4.258% for those options granted on April 29, 2003. We looked to our peer
group for the volatility index as our common stock is not publicly traded. No adjustments were made for non-transferability
and the lack of liquidity. Our use of this model does not necessarily mean that we believe that this model accurately
determines the value of options. The ultimate value of the options in this table depends upon each holder’s individual
investment decisions and the actual performance of our common stock.

Average compensation for Mr. Plant is the actual amount of salary for the preceding year (but not
less than $1,350,000), plus the greater of (i) $650,000 or (ii) the average of annual performance
bonuses earned under Mr. Plant’s employment agreement (not to exceed the previous three years).
Average compensation for Messrs. Cantie and Bialosky is the average of the highest five consecutive
calendar years of covered compensation, where covered compensation for a given year is the total of
actual salary and performance bonus for the preceding year. The estimated pension benefits shown
in the table above assume payments in the form of a single life annuity following retirement on or
after age 60. Retiree benefits are reduced after the retiree reaches age 62 to reflect Social Security

benefits. Benefits payable to Mr. Plant are offset by benefits payable from our plan in the United
Kingdom and may commence on an unreduced basis as early as age 57[1]⁄2.

Our nonqualified supplemental plans consist of two supplemental retirement income plans under
which we have undertaken to pay any retirement benefits otherwise payable to certain individuals,
including the named executive officers, under the terms of our qualified retirement plan but for the
provisions of the Code limiting amounts payable under tax-qualified retirement plans in certain
circumstances. The supplemental retirement income plan covering Messrs. Cantie and Bialosky is
unfunded. We have established a so-called ‘‘rabbi trust’’ to provide a source of payment for benefits
under the supplemental retirement income plan covering Mr. Plant. Amounts are deposited in this
trust from time to time to provide a source of payments to Mr. Plant when he retires.

The following table shows the approximate annual pension benefits payable under our qualified and
nonqualified supplemental plans to Messrs. Plant, Lunn and Lake, participants in our plans applicable
to senior management employees located in the United Kingdom.

Final compensation is salary over the 12 months prior to retirement plus the average of pensionable
bonus for the last five years prior to retirement. The pensionable bonus in any year is the actual
bonus paid for the year, subject to a cap of 10% of the year’s salary.

The estimated benefits reflect an annual payment assuming payments are made to Mr. Plant on a
monthly basis following retirement on or after age 57[1]⁄2 and to Messrs. Lunn and Lake on or after
age 62[1]⁄2. The benefits of Messrs. Plant, Lunn and Lake will not be reduced as a result of any state
benefits to which they may otherwise be entitled.

The years of service completed by the named executive officers are as follows: Mr. Plant – 25 years
of service; Mr. Lunn – 6 years of service; Mr. Lake – 28 years of service; Mr. Cantie –
8 years of service; and Mr. Bialosky – 14 years of service.

#### Employment agreements

In connection with the consummation of the Transactions, employment agreements between certain
executives and TRW and its affiliates were terminated. We entered into new employment agreements
with each of Messrs. Plant, Lunn, Alberico, Bialosky, Cantie and Lake.

The employment agreement of Mr. Plant extends for an indefinite term, subject to termination of his
employment by either Mr. Plant or us pursuant to the terms of the agreement, and provides for the
payment of a base salary and a bonus opportunity equal to 200% of Mr. Plant’s base salary. The
agreement includes a confidentiality provision and a noncompetition and nonsolicitation provision for
a term of two years following Mr. Plant’s termination of employment with us for any reason.

Mr. Plant’s employment agreement also provides that if he is terminated by us without ‘‘cause’’ (other
than due to his death or ‘‘disability’’) or he resigns with ‘‘good reason’’ prior to a ‘‘change in control’’

112


-----

(as such terms are defined in the agreement), he will be entitled to receive: (1) continued payment of
his base salary and a monthly payment equal to the average of his annual bonuses received prior to
termination divided by 12 for a period of two years; (2) continued welfare benefit coverage and
certain perquisites for a period of 24 months; (3) a pro rata bonus for the year of termination; and (4)
a supplemental retirement benefit equal to the excess of (A) the benefit Mr. Plant would have earned
under our defined benefit pension plan had Mr. Plant participated and was credited with two
additional years of service over (B) the benefit he would have earned under our defined benefit
pension plan had he participated, without the benefit of the additional two years of service, payable
monthly for a period of 24 months following his termination of employment.

The agreement additionally provides that if Mr. Plant is terminated by us without cause (other than
due to his death or disability) or resigns with good reason prior to a change in control, but during a
period of discussion in anticipation of a change in control, and such change in control subsequently
occurs, he shall also be entitled to a lump sum payment, upon the change in control, equal to (1) the
remainder of the cash severance benefits payable in clause (1) in the preceding paragraph, and (2)
the sum of his base salary and average annual bonuses received prior to termination.

Mr. Plant’s employment agreement also provides that if Mr. Plant is terminated by us without cause
(other than due to his death or disability) or resigns with good reason following a change in control
but prior to the first anniversary of such change in control, he will be entitled to receive: (1) a lump
sum payment equal to the sum of (A) two times his base salary and average annual bonus and (B)
the sum of his base salary and average annual bonus multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of months from the date of termination until the first anniversary of the change in
control and the denominator of which is 12; (2) continued welfare benefit coverage and certain
perquisites for a period of 24 months; (3) a pro rata bonus for the year of termination; and (4) the
supplemental retirement benefit described above. In addition, Mr. Plant may resign for any reason
during the sixty-day period following the first anniversary of such change in control and will be
entitled to receive severance benefits he would be entitled to receive if he was terminated without
cause or resigned with good reason prior to a change in control as described above; provided that he
would receive his base salary and average annual bonus severance benefit in a lump sum.

The employment agreement of Mr. Lunn extends for an indefinite term, subject to termination of his
employment by either Mr. Lunn or us pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The employment
agreements of Messrs. Alberico, Bialosky, Cantie and Lake extend for a three-year term followed by
automatic additional one-year terms unless notice of termination of the executive’s employment is
provided by us or the executive prior the expiration of the term. The agreements provide for the
payment of a base salary and a bonus opportunity equal to a specified percentage of the executives’
base salary. Each agreement includes a confidentiality provision and a noncompetition and
nonsolicitation provision for a term of 18 months (24 months for Mr. Lunn) following the termination of
the executive’s employment with us for any reason other than a termination upon or following the
expiration of the employment agreement. The agreements also provide that if the executive is
terminated by us without ‘‘cause’’ or the executive resigns with ‘‘good reason’’ prior to a ‘‘change in
control’’ (as such terms are defined in the agreements), such executive will be entitled to receive (1)
continued payment of his base salary and a monthly payment equal to the average of his annual
bonuses received prior to termination divided by 12 for a period of time equal to (A) two years for Mr.
Lunn and (B) 18 months for Messrs. Alberico, Bialosky, Cantie and Lake; (2) continued welfare
benefits coverage for a period of 18 months (two years for Mr. Lunn); and (3) a pro rata bonus for
the year of termination. In addition, upon such termination of employment, Mr. Lunn will be entitled to
(1) a supplemental retirement benefit equal to the excess of (A) the benefit Mr. Lunn would have
earned under our UK defined benefit pension plan had Mr. Lunn participated and was credited with
two additional years of service over (B) the benefit he would have earned under our UK defined
benefit pension plan had he participated, without the benefit of the additional two years of service,
payable monthly for a period of 24 months following his termination of employment and (2) two
additional years of credited service under the Lucas Funded Executive Pension Scheme No. 4.

The agreements additionally provide that if the executive is terminated by us without cause (other
than due to his death or disability) or resigns with good reason prior to a change in control, but

113


-----

during a period of discussion in anticipation of a change in control, and such change in control
subsequently occurs, he shall also be entitled to a lump sum payment, upon the change in control,
equal to (1) the remainder of the cash severance benefits payable in clause (1) in the preceding
paragraph, and (2) the sum of his base salary and average annual bonuses received prior to
termination.

The employment agreements also provide that if the executive is terminated by us without cause
(other than due to his death or disability) or resigns with good reason following a change in control
but prior to the first anniversary of such change in control, he will be entitled to receive: (1) a lump
sum payment equal to the sum of (A) 1.5 times his base salary and average annual bonus (two
times for Mr. Lunn) and (B) the sum of his base salary and average annual bonus multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months from the date of termination until the first
anniversary of the change in control and the denominator of which is 12; (2) continued welfare
benefit coverage and certain perquisites for a period of 18 months (24 months for Mr. Lunn); and (3)
a pro rata bonus for the year of termination.

In addition, in the case of the employment agreements for Messrs. Alberico, Bialosky, Cantie and
Lake, if we terminate the executive upon or following the expiration of his employment term, he will
be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to his base salary and annual bonus, continued welfare
benefits coverage for a period of one year and a pro rata bonus for the year of termination.

## Certain relationships and related transactions

#### Ancillary agreements to the master purchase agreement

Pursuant to the master purchase agreement, described under ‘‘The Acquisition,’’ we entered into the
following ancillary agreements with Northrop Grumman or certain of its affiliates on or prior to the
closing of the Acquisition.

**_Intellectual property license agreements. Under the intellectual property license agreements, (1)_**
TRW granted to us, subject to certain restrictions, a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide
license to use certain intellectual property rights owned by TRW that are necessary to conduct our
business in its current form, and (2) we granted to TRW, subject to certain restrictions, a perpetual,
non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use certain intellectual property rights, including
trademark rights, that we own after the Acquisition in all fields outside of the automotive field.

**_Transition services agreement. The transition services agreement provides for certain_**
administrative, treasury, risk management and other services and support (1) that are provided by
TRW to us, and (2) that are provided by us to TRW, in each case for specified terms of up to one
year after the Acquisition.

**_Employee matters agreement. The employee matters agreement provides for the allocation_**
between TRW and us of certain assets and liabilities and certain other matters relating to employees,
employee benefit plans and compensation agreements. For a period of one year following the closing
of the Acquisition, all individuals who become our employees as a result of the Acquisition, referred
to as the ‘‘Transferred Employees,’’ are provided compensation and employee benefits that are no
less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and employee benefits provided by TRW
and its affiliates. Pursuant to the employee matters agreement or by operation of law upon the
closing date of the Acquisition, we assumed sponsorship of certain employee benefit plans and
arrangements previously maintained by affiliates of TRW for the Transferred Employees prior to the
Acquisition, and we received a transfer of assets from TRW and its affiliates from funding
arrangements maintained attendant to such employee benefit plans and arrangements.

**_Insurance allocation agreement. The insurance allocation agreement allocates between TRW and_**
us certain rights and obligations with respect to insurance policies of TRW that were in effect prior to
the closing of the Acquisition. Generally, insurance coverages related to TRW liabilities were retained
by TRW, and insurance coverages related to our liabilities were assigned to us. We agreed to
relinquish any claims to future payments from TRW’s captive insurance companies, and to indemnify
TRW against future claims brought against the captive insurance companies with respect to our
liabilities. Similarly, we agreed to bear the cost of reinsurance provided by TRW’s captive insurance
company to commercial insurers with respect to our liabilities. TRW is obligated to assist us, if
requested, in carrying out certain risk-management-related tasks, and we are obligated to reimburse
TRW for its out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred in providing such assistance.

**_Stockholders’ agreement. TRW Automotive Holdings, Automotive Investors L.L.C., a Blackstone_**
controlled entity, and Northrop Grumman or an affiliate of Northrop Grumman have entered into a
stockholders’ agreement on the closing of the Acquisition. Blackstone and each other equity investor
hold their equity interests in TRW Automotive Holdings indirectly through equity interests in
Automotive Investors L.L.C. The stockholders’ agreement provides for our governance and the
governance of TRW Automotive Holdings, and provides specific stockholder rights, such as
registration rights and co-sale rights, with respect to certain sales of capital stock of TRW Automotive
Holdings.

All significant decisions involving TRW Automotive Holdings or its direct or indirect subsidiaries
require the approval of the board of directors of TRW Automotive Holdings, acting by a simple
majority vote. The board of directors of TRW Automotive Holdings consists of seven members, the
majority of whom have been designated by the holder of a majority of the outstanding stock of TRW
Automotive Holdings and one of whom has been designated by an affiliate of Northrop Grumman.
Our chief executive officer is represented on the board of directors of TRW Automotive Holdings.

116


-----

Any stockholders transferring at least a majority of the outstanding stock of TRW Automotive
Holdings in a transaction has the right to drag along the other stockholders in such transaction and is
subject to the right of such other stockholders to tag along in such transaction. The holder of a
majority of the outstanding stock of TRW Automotive Holdings has the right to initiate any demand
registration right until the later of the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Acquisition and 180
days after an initial public offering. Thereafter, other stockholders having at least a specified minimum
amount of stock may have demand rights. Stockholders are entitled to piggyback registration rights
exercisable in connection with registrations initiated by TRW Automotive Holdings or other
stockholders’ demand registrations.

**_Transaction and monitoring fee agreement. In connection with the Acquisition, Blackstone entered_**
into a transaction and monitoring fee agreement whereby Blackstone agreed to provide us
monitoring, advisory and consulting services, including advice regarding (i) structure, terms and
negotiation of debt and equity offerings; (ii) relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries’
lenders and bankers; (iii) corporate strategy; (iv) acquisitions or disposals and (v) other financial
advisory services as more fully described in the agreement. For these services, we paid an upfront
transaction and advisory fee of $49 million upon closing of the Acquisition, and have agreed to pay
an annual monitoring fee of $5 million. Blackstone may elect under certain circumstances to receive,
in lieu of annual payments of the monitoring fee, a single lump sum cash payment equal to the
then-present value of all then-current and future monitoring fees payable under this agreement,
assuming the termination date to be the tenth anniversary of the closing date of the Acquisition. We
agreed to indemnify Blackstone and its affiliates, directors, officers and representatives for losses
relating to the services contemplated by the transaction and monitoring fee agreement and the
engagement of Blackstone pursuant to, and the performance by Blackstone of the services
contemplated by, the transaction and monitoring fee agreement.

#### Northrop Grumman subordinated note

As part of the consideration for the Acquisition, TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings issued a
$600 million face amount subordinated 8% pay-in-kind note due 2018 to an affiliate of Northrop
Grumman.

The pay-in-kind note will mature on the fifteenth anniversary of the issue date, or the twelfth
anniversary if, on or at any date after the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Acquisition, the
debt rating on our lowest rated securities is investment grade. The pay-in-kind note bears interest at
8% per year initially, payable in kind at the option of TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings until
maturity, with an increase to 10% per year from the first date on or after the fifth anniversary of the
closing date of the Acquisition that the debt rating on our lowest rated securities is investment grade.
We do not expect that the debt rating on our lowest rated securities will be investment grade on the
fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Acquisition. Therefore, we have valued the note based on
the 15 year life and 8% pay-in-kind interest and determined that the fair value of this note is $348
million using a 12% discount rate. Notwithstanding TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings’ option to
make cash interest payments, our senior credit facilities and the indentures governing the notes
prohibit the payment of dividends by us to TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings for the purpose of
making any payments in respect of, or otherwise servicing the obligations represented by, the
Northrop Grumman note. If TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings declares and pays a dividend
(other than a stock dividend and subject to certain other exceptions) to its stockholders, then
commencing on the payment date for such dividend, interest on the note will thereafter be payable in
cash, in quarterly installments.

Payments under the pay-in-kind note are structurally and contractually subordinated to the prior
payment in full of our notes and all our other senior debt and any senior debt of TRW Automotive
Intermediate Holdings.

## Description of other indebtedness

#### Senior credit facilities

The senior credit facilities are provided by a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions led by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, as exclusive administrative agent and collateral agent and lead arranger,
Credit Suisse First Boston, acting through its Cayman Islands branch, as co-syndication agent and
lead arranger, Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as co-syndication agent and lead arranger, Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc., as co-syndication agent and arranger, and Bank of America, N.A., as
documentation agent and arranger.

We amended our senior credit facilities on July 22, 2003 (as amended, the ‘‘senior credit facilities’’)
by entering into new term loan C facilities in order to refinance the term loan B facilities and a portion
of the term loan A facility and thereby reduce our annual cash interest expense.

The senior credit facilities provide senior secured financing of $2.01 billion, consisting of:

   - a $210 million term loan A facility with a maturity of six years;

   - term loan C facilities with a maturity of eight years consisting of a $1,150 million dollar
denominated facility and t95 million euro denominated facility; and

   - a $500 million revolving credit facility with a maturity of six years.

We are borrowers under the term loan facilities and the revolving credit facility, and certain of our
foreign subsidiaries are additional borrowers under the revolving credit facility. A portion of the
revolving credit facility is available to our foreign subsidiary borrowers in euros, pounds sterling and
certain other local currencies. The revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for
letters of credit and for borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as the swingline loans.

**_Interest rate and fees_**

Borrowings under the senior credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus,
at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) JPMorgan Chase
Bank’s prime rate and (2) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1% or (b) a LIBOR or eurocurrency rate
determined by reference to the costs of funds for deposits in the currency of such borrowing for the
interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs. At June 27, 2003, the
margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan A facility was 2.50% with
respect to base rate borrowings and 3.50% with respect to eurocurrency borrowings. The applicable
margin for such borrowings may be reduced or increased based on our attaining certain leverage
ratios. At June 27, 2003, the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan B facilities was
3.00% with respect to base rate borrowings and 4.00% with respect to eurocurrency borrowings.
Assuming the same leverage ratio, at June 27, 2003, on a pro forma basis, the applicable margin for
borrowings under the term loan C facilities would have been 2.00% with respect to base rate
borrowings and 3.00% with respect to eurocurrency borrowings. The applicable margin for the
borrowings under term loan C facilities is not subject to reduction.

In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the senior credit facilities, we are
required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the
unutilized commitments thereunder at a rate equal to 0.75% per annum (to be reduced to 0.50% per
annum during the period (a) in which borrowings under the revolving facility exceed 50% of total
revolving facility commitments or (b) that we maintain a total leverage ratio of less than 3.25 to 1.00
but greater than 2.00 to 1.00, and to be further reduced to 0.375% per annum during the period in
which we maintain a total leverage ratio of less than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00). We also pay
customary letter of credit fees.

**_Prepayments_**

The senior credit facilities require us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions,
with:

118


-----

   - 75% (which percentage will be reduced to 50% if our leverage ratio is less than 3.25 to 1.00
and to 25% if our leverage ratio is less than 2.00 to 1.00) of our excess cash flow;

   - 100% of the net cash proceeds of asset sales and casualty and condemnation events, if we
do not reinvest those proceeds in assets to be used in our business or to make certain other
permitted investments within 12 months, subject to certain limitations; and

   - 100% of the net proceeds of any incurrence of debt other than debt permitted under the
senior credit facilities.

We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the senior credit facilities at any time without
premium or penalty, other than customary ‘‘breakage’’ costs with respect to eurocurrency or LIBOR
loans.

**_Amortization_**

The term loans amortize each year generally in equal quarterly amounts (or in the case of the period
after December 31, 2009 with respect to term loan C facilities, in quarterly amounts until the maturity
date) in the following approximate aggregate principal amounts (in millions) for each year set forth
below:


**Term loan C**

Principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility will be due and payable in full at
maturity, six years from the date of the closing of the senior credit facilities.

**_Guarantee and security_**

All obligations under the senior credit facilities are (1) unconditionally guaranteed by TRW Automotive
Holdings and, subject to certain exceptions, each existing and future domestic subsidiary of TRW
Automotive Holdings, including TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings (other than our receivables
subsidiaries), referred to collectively, as U.S. Guarantors and (2) guaranteed by TRW Automotive
Luxembourg to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Luxembourg law. In addition, the
borrowings of our foreign subsidiary borrowers under the revolving credit facility are unconditionally
guaranteed (referred to as the foreign guarantees) by certain of our foreign subsidiaries.

In addition, all obligations under the senior credit facilities, and the guarantees of those obligations,
are secured by substantially all the assets of TRW Automotive Holdings, us and each U.S. Guarantor,
including, but not limited to, the following, and subject to certain exceptions:

   - a pledge of 100% of our capital stock, 100% of the capital stock of each U.S. Guarantor,
100% of the capital stock of TRW Automotive Luxembourg directly owned by us and 65% of
the capital stock of each of our foreign subsidiaries (other than TRW Automotive
Luxembourg) that are directly owned by us or one of the U.S. Guarantors;

119


-----

   - a security interest in substantially all tangible and intangible assets of TRW Automotive
Holdings, us and each U.S. Guarantor (but excluding receivables sold to the receivables
subsidiaries under the receivables facility); and

   - a security interest in the notes evidencing our loan to TRW Automotive Luxembourg and its
loans to certain of our foreign subsidiaries in connection with the Acquisition.

In addition, the obligations of the foreign subsidiary borrowers under the senior credit facilities, and
foreign guarantees of such obligations, are, subject to certain exceptions and only to the extent
permitted by applicable legal and contractual provisions and to the extent that it does not result in
adverse tax consequences, are secured by the following:

    - a pledge of the capital stock of each foreign borrower and each foreign guarantor; and

    - a lien on substantially all tangible and intangible assets of each foreign borrower and each
foreign guarantor (but excluding receivables sold to the receivables subsidiaries under the
receivables facility).

**_Certain covenants and events of default_**

The senior credit facilities contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to
certain exceptions, our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to:

    - sell assets;

    - incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;

    - repay other indebtedness (including the notes);

    - pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock;

    - create liens on assets;

    - make investments, loans or advances;

    - make certain acquisitions;

    - engage in mergers or consolidations;

    - enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

    - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

    - amend certain material agreements governing our indebtedness, including the notes and
the receivables facility;

    - change the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries;

    - enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries; and

    - enter into hedging agreements.

In addition, the senior credit facilities require us to maintain the following financial covenants:

    - a maximum total leverage ratio;

    - a minimum interest coverage ratio; and

    - a maximum capital expenditures limitation.

The senior credit facilities also contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default.

#### Receivables facility

Our receivables facility provides up to $600 million in funding from commercial paper conduits
sponsored by several of the lenders under our senior credit facilities, based on availability of eligible
receivables and other customary factors.

120


-----

On February 28, 2003, certain of our subsidiaries (the ‘‘sellers’’) signed a receivables purchase
agreement and began selling trade account receivables (the ‘‘receivables’’) originated by them in the
United States through the receivables facility. Receivables are sold to TRW Automotive Receivables
LLC (the ‘‘transferor’’) at a discount. The transferor is a bankruptcy-remote special purpose limited
liability company that is our wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary. The transferor’s purchase of
receivables is financed through a transfer agreement with TRW Automotive Global Receivables LLC
(the ‘‘borrower’’). Under the terms of the transfer agreement, the borrower purchases all receivables
sold to the transferor. The borrower is a bankruptcy-remote qualifying special purpose limited liability
company that is wholly-owned by the transferor and is not consolidated when certain requirements
are met as further described below.

Multi-seller commercial paper conduits supported by committed liquidity facilities are available to
provide cash funding for the borrower’s purchase of receivables through secured loans/tranches to
the extent desired and permitted under a receivables loan agreement. A note is issued by the
borrowers to the transferor for the difference between the purchase price for the receivables
purchased and cash available to be borrowed through the facility. The sellers of the receivables act
as servicing agents under the servicing agreement and continue to service the transferred
receivables for which they receive a monthly servicing fee at a rate of 1% per annum of the average
daily outstanding balance of receivables.

Availability of funding under the receivables facility depends primarily upon the outstanding trade
accounts receivable balance for the week as of Friday of the previous week. This balance is reported
no later than the third business day of the subsequent week to the lenders. Availability is determined
by reducing the receivables balance by outstanding borrowings under the program, the historical rate
of collection on those receivables and other characteristics of those receivables that effect their
eligibility (such as bankruptcy or downgrading below investment grade of the obligor, delinquency and
excessive concentration).

The receivables facility lenders have recourse for amounts borrowed under the receivables facility
only to the borrower and the receivables held by it, including receivables in excess of amounts
funded. Recourse to the sellers and the transferor are limited to breaches of representations,
warranties and covenants and as described below. We irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the
servicing and certain other performance obligations of the sellers under the receivables purchase
agreement.

The commercial paper conduits may discontinue funding the receivables facility at any time for any
reason. If they do, affiliates or other entities associated with the commercial paper conduits that have
short-term debt ratings of a least A-1 by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group, Inc. and P-1 by Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. are obligated to fund the receivables facility.

Advances under the receivables facility are currently available in U.S. dollars and may be available in
the future in euros and pounds sterling. A portion of the underlying receivables may be denominated
in currencies other than U.S. dollars, primarily euros.

**_Interest_**

The commercial paper conduits provide funding at their quoted cost of funds for issuing commercial
paper. When not funded by the commercial paper conduits (but directly through conduit sponsors),
the receivables facility will provide funding at our then-current revolving credit facility spread plus
either (1) the LIBOR rate, adjusted for statutory reserves or (2) the higher of JPMorgan Chase Bank’s
prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%.

**_Fees_**

The receivables facility fees include a usage fee based on the borrower’s leverage ratio, which fee is
currently 1.50%, payable to the commercial paper conduits based upon the amount funded and a
commitment fee of 0.50% based on the unused portion of the commitments. These rates are per
annum and payments of these fees are made to the lenders on the monthly settlement date.

121


-----

**_Early termination events_**

The receivables facility may be terminated for material breaches of representations and warranties,
bankruptcies of the sellers or a receivables subsidiary, a deficiency in the amount of receivables
lasting longer than three days, unsatisfactory performance of the receivables portfolio, cross-defaults
to our other debt, or breach of specified financial covenants, among other reasons. The receivables
facility contains the same financial covenants as our senior credit facilities.

**_Accounting matters_**

This facility can be treated as a general financing agreement or as an off balance sheet financing
arrangement. Whether the funding and related receivables are shown as liabilities and assets,
respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet, or, conversely, are removed from the consolidated
balance sheet depends on the level of the multi-seller conduits’ loans to the borrower. When such
level is at least 10% of the fair value of all of the borrower’s assets (consisting principally of
receivables sold by the sellers), the securitization transactions are accounted for as a sale of the
receivables under the provisions of SFAS 140, ‘‘Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial
Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,’’ and are removed from the consolidated balance sheet.
The proceeds received are included in cash flows from operating activities in the statements of cash
flows. Costs associated with the receivables facility are recorded as loss on sale of receivables in the
Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The book value of the Company’s retained interest
in the receivables approximates fair market value due to the current nature of the receivables.

However, at such time as the fair value of the multi-seller commercial paper conduits’ loans are less
than 10% of the fair value of all of the borrower’s assets, we are required to consolidate the
borrower, resulting in the funding and related receivables being shown as liabilities and assets,
respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet and the costs associated with the receivables facility
being recorded as interest expense. As there were no borrowings outstanding under the receivables
facility on June 27, 2003, the fair value of the multi-seller conduits’ loans was less than 10% of the
fair value of all of the borrower’s assets and, therefore, the financial position and results of operations
of the borrower were included in our consolidated financial statements as of June 27, 2003.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently issued its Interpretation No. 46, which may affect
the way in which sponsors account for their sponsored commercial paper conduits. This interpretation
is effective immediately for new arrangements entered into after January 31, 2003 and for quarterly
periods beginning after June 15, 2003 for older arrangements. Changes in accounting, if any,
required of the conduit sponsors could result in increased regulatory capital or other costs for the
sponsors of funding in the commercial paper conduit. We have agreed to reimburse the sponsors for
these increased costs up to an agreed upon maximum amount such that our total funding costs will
not exceed the cost of funding directly through conduit sponsors. It is also possible that as a result of
these accounting changes one or more of our commercial paper conduit lenders may elect to
discontinue funding, requiring our receivables subsidiaries to finance a portion of the receivables
facility directly with the conduit sponsors at the rates described above. Consequently, the cost of the
receivables facility to us could increase as a result of these accounting changes. We do not currently
expect the new guidance to alter our accounting treatment for the receivables facility.

#### Lucas Varity senior notes

One of our foreign subsidiaries, Lucas Industries plc, has £95 million in principal amount of 10.875%
senior notes due 2020 outstanding. We assumed this indebtedness in the Acquisition. The trust deed
governing the Lucas Varity senior notes contains limitations on borrowings and disposals of assets by
Lucas Industries and its subsidiaries. The Lucas Varity senior notes also contain customary events of
default.

## Description of senior notes

#### General

The dollar senior notes were issued under an indenture (the ‘‘dollar senior indenture’’), dated as of
February 18, 2003, between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee, as supplemented
by a supplemental indenture, dated as of February 28, 2003, among the Company, each of the
Company’s direct and indirect Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries that are Domestic Subsidiaries
and TRW Automotive Finance (Luxembourg), SARL (‘‘TRW Automotive Luxembourg’’), a Luxembourg
Restricted Subsidiary, as Subsidiary Senior Guarantors, and the Trustee. The euro senior notes were
issued under an indenture (the ‘‘euro senior indenture,’’ and together with the dollar senior indenture,
the ‘‘senior indentures’’), dated as of February 18, 2003, between the Company and The Bank of
New York, as Trustee, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture, dated as of February 28, 2003,
among the Company, each of the Company’s direct and indirect Wholly Owned Restricted
Subsidiaries that are Domestic Subsidiaries and TRW Automotive Luxembourg, as Subsidiary Senior
Guarantors, and the Trustee. Copies of the indentures may be obtained from the Company upon
request, and for so long as the senior notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the
rules of such stock exchange shall so require, copies of the senior indentures may be obtained upon
request to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The dollar senior notes and the euro senior notes are
collectively referred to as the ‘‘senior notes.’’

The following summary of material provisions of the senior indentures and the senior notes does not
purport to be complete. Capitalized terms used in this ‘‘Description of senior notes’’ section and not
otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in the section ‘‘—Certain definitions.’’ As used in this
‘‘Description of senior notes’’ section, the ‘‘Company,’’ ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us’’ and ‘‘our’’ means TRW Automotive
Inc. and not any of its Subsidiaries, ‘‘TRW Automotive Holdings’’ means TRW Automotive Holdings
Corp., and ‘‘TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings’’ means TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings
Corp.

We issued dollar senior notes with an initial aggregate principal amount of $925 million and we
issued euro senior notes in an initial aggregate principal amount of t200 million. We may issue
additional senior notes from time to time after this offering. Any offering of additional senior notes is
subject to the covenant described below under the caption ‘‘Certain covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.’’ The dollar
senior notes and any additional dollar senior notes subsequently issued under the dollar senior
indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the dollar senior indenture,
including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. The euro
senior notes and any additional euro senior notes subsequently issued under the euro senior
indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the euro senior indenture, including,
without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the senior notes will be payable, and the senior notes
may be exchanged or transferred, at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York (which initially shall be the principal corporate trust office of the
Trustee, at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286), and, so long as the senior notes are
listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the
senior notes will be payable, and the senior notes may be exchanged or transferred, at the office of
the paying agent in Luxembourg, except that, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may
be made by check mailed to the holders at their registered addresses.

The senior notes were issued only in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of
$1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in the case of the dollar senior notes, and in
denominations of t1,000 and any integral multiple of t1,000 in the case of the euro senior notes.
No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of senior notes, but the
Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other similar
governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

123


-----

#### Terms of the senior notes

The senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and will mature on February 15,
2013. Each senior note bears interest at a rate per annum shown on the front cover of this listing
memorandum from February 18, 2003 or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid
or provided for, payable semiannually to holders of record at the close of business on the February 1
or August 1 immediately preceding the interest payment date on February 15 and August 15 of each
year, commencing August 15, 2003. Interest on the senior notes is computed on the basis of a
360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

Additional interest is payable with respect to the senior notes in certain circumstances if the
exchange offers are not completed on or prior to 290 days after the Issue Date or if certain other
conditions are not satisfied. We have filed a registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the
exchange offers with the SEC on July 1, 2003.

#### Optional redemption

Except as set forth in the following paragraph, the senior notes will not be redeemable at the option
of the Company prior to February 15, 2008. Thereafter, the senior notes will be redeemable, at the
Company’s option, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice
mailed by first-class mail to each holder’s registered address, at the following redemption prices
(expressed as a percentage of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
interest, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month

In addition, at any time and from time to time prior to February 15, 2006, the Company may redeem
in the aggregate up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the dollar senior notes
(calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional dollar senior notes) with the net cash
proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings (1) by the Company or (2) by TRW Automotive Holdings or
TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings, in each case, to the extent the net cash proceeds thereof
are contributed to the Company or used to purchase Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of
the Company from it, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount thereof)
of 109.375% plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the redemption date
(subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that at least 65% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the dollar senior notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional
dollar senior notes) must remain outstanding after each such redemption and provided further that

124


-----

such redemption shall occur within 90 days after the date on which any such Equity Offering is
consummated upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice mailed to each holder of dollar
senior notes being redeemed and otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the dollar
senior indenture. Additionally, at any time and from time to time prior to February 15, 2006, the
Company may redeem in the aggregate up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the
euro senior notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional euro senior notes) with
the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings (1) by the Company or (2) by TRW
Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings, in each case, to the extent the net
cash proceeds thereof are contributed to the Company or used to purchase Capital Stock (other than
Disqualified Stock) of the Company from it, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of
principal amount thereof) of 110.125% plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any,
to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that at least 65% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the euro senior notes (calculated after giving effect to any
issuance of additional euro senior notes) must remain outstanding after each such redemption and
_provided further that such redemption shall occur within 90 days after the date on which any such_
Equity Offering is consummated upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice mailed to each
holder of euro senior notes being redeemed and otherwise in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the euro senior indenture.

#### Selection

In the case of any partial redemption, selection of the senior notes for redemption will be made by
the Trustee in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any,
on which such senior notes are listed, or if such senior notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis,
by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner
as complies with applicable legal requirements); provided that no dollar senior notes of $1,000 or
less, or euro senior notes of t1,000 or less, shall be redeemed in part. If any senior note is to be
redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to such senior note shall state the portion of
the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new senior note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the
original senior note. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on senior notes
or portions thereof called for redemption so long as the Company has deposited with the Paying
Agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest
(if any) on, the senior notes to be redeemed.

#### Ranking

The indebtedness evidenced by the senior notes are unsecured Senior Indebtedness of the
Company, rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the
Company and are senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of
the Company. The senior notes are also effectively subordinated to any Secured Indebtedness of the
Company to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Secured Indebtedness.

The indebtedness evidenced by the Senior Guarantees are unsecured Senior Indebtedness of the
applicable Guarantor, rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior
Indebtedness of such Guarantor and are senior in right of payment to all existing and future
Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor. The Senior Guarantees are also effectively
subordinated to any Secured Indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor to the extent of the value of
the assets securing such Secured Indebtedness.

-----

At June 27, 2003, as a result of the Transactions,

(1) the Company had $2,848 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Indebtedness,
including the senior notes, outstanding (excluding unused commitments), $1,520 million of
which was Secured Indebtedness;

(2) the Company had $443 million aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Indebtedness
outstanding, consisting of the Senior Subordinated Notes;

(3) the Company’s Subsidiaries had total indebtedness (excluding intercompany liabilities and
guarantees under the Credit Agreement) of $239 million;

(4) the Company had a short-term note payable to Northrop Grumman reflecting certain
estimated post-closing adjustments, subject to final negotiations; and

(5) there were no advances outstanding under the Company’s receivables facility.

Although the senior indentures contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness which
the Company and its Subsidiaries may Incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such
Indebtedness could be substantial and, in any case, such Indebtedness may be Secured
Indebtedness. See ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock’’ below.

Substantially all of the operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Unless the
Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and
claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally have priority with respect to
the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company, including
holders of the senior notes. The senior notes, therefore, are effectively subordinated to creditors
(including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company that are
not Guarantors. Although the senior indentures limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness by and the
issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of certain of the Company’s Subsidiaries, such
limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications.

#### Senior guarantees

Each of the Company’s direct and indirect Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries that were Domestic
Subsidiaries (other than Receivables Subsidiaries) on the Acquisition Date and all future Wholly
Owned Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company that are Domestic Subsidiaries and all non-wholly
owned Domestic Subsidiaries that are Significant Subsidiaries, in each case that guarantee
Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement jointly and severally irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantee on an unsecured senior basis the performance and punctual payment when due, whether
at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Company under the senior
indentures and the senior notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or
additional interest on the senior notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations
guaranteed by such Guarantors being herein called the ‘‘Guaranteed Obligations’’). Such Guarantors
agree to pay, in addition to the amount stated above, any and all expenses (including reasonable
counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or the holders in enforcing any rights under the
Senior Guarantees. Additionally, (1) if, and so long as, TRW Automotive Luxembourg provides a
guarantee under the Credit Agreement, TRW Automotive Luxembourg will, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Luxembourg law, provide a Senior Guarantee of the Guaranteed
Obligations and (2) if TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings is
engaged in any business in any material respect other than incidental to its ownership, directly or
indirectly, of the capital stock of the Company or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings, as
applicable, or acquires any assets that are material, other than capital stock of the Company or TRW
Automotive Intermediate Holdings, as applicable, TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive
Intermediate Holdings, as applicable, will execute and deliver to the Trustee a Senior Guarantee
pursuant to which TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings, as
applicable, will guarantee payment of the senior notes. Upon the release of TRW Automotive

126


-----

Luxembourg’s guarantee under the Credit Agreement, TRW Automotive Luxembourg’s Senior
Guarantee will be released and discharged at such time. In the event that TRW Automotive
Luxembourg thereafter guarantees Indebtedness of the Company under the Credit Agreement, TRW
Automotive Luxembourg will again provide a Senior Guarantee of the Guaranteed Obligations.

Each Senior Guarantee will be limited in amount to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount
that can be guaranteed by the applicable Guarantor without rendering the Senior Guarantee, as it
relates to such Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. After the Acquisition Date,
the Company will cause (1) each Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary that is a Domestic Subsidiary
(unless such Subsidiary is a Receivables Subsidiary) that Incurs or guarantees certain Indebtedness
or issues shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and (2) each non-wholly owned Domestic
Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary that guarantees Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement
to execute and deliver to the Trustee supplemental indentures pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the senior notes on the same unsecured senior basis. See
‘‘—Future guarantors’’ below.

Each Senior Guarantee is a continuing guarantee and shall:

(1) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations;

(2) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, be binding upon each such Guarantor and its
successors; and

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders and their
successors, transferees and assigns.

A Senior Guarantee will be automatically released upon the sale (including through merger or
consolidation) of the Capital Stock, or all or substantially all the assets, of the applicable Guarantor if:

(1) such sale is made in compliance with the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain
covenants—Assets Sales;’’ and

(2) such Guarantor is released from its guarantees, if any, of, and all pledges and security, if
any, granted in connection with, the Credit Agreement and any other Indebtedness of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

A Senior Guarantee also will be automatically released upon the applicable Subsidiary ceasing to be
a Subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing Bank
Indebtedness or other exercise of remedies in respect thereof or if such Subsidiary is released from
its guarantees of, and all pledges and security interests granted in connection with, the Credit
Agreement. In addition, a Senior Guarantee made by any Restricted Subsidiary will be automatically
released if the Company designates such Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary and such
designation complies with the other applicable provisions of the applicable senior indenture.

#### Change of control

Upon the occurrence of any of the following events (each, a ‘‘Change of Control’’), each holder will
have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s senior notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), except to the extent the
Company has previously elected to redeem senior notes as described under ‘‘—Optional
redemption’’:

(1) the sale, lease or transfer, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially
all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to a Person other
than the Permitted Holders; or

(2) (A) the Company becomes aware (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) of the

127


-----

acquisition by any Person or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or Section
14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, or any successor provision), including any group acting for
the purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of securities (within the meaning of Rule
13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act), other than the Permitted Holders, in a single
transaction or in a related series of transactions, by way of merger, consolidation or other
business combination or purchase of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act, or any successor provision), of 35% or more of the total
voting power of the Voting Stock of the Company or TRW Automotive Holdings and (B) the
Permitted Holders beneficially own (as defined above), directly or indirectly, in the
aggregate a lesser percentage of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the
Company or TRW Automotive Holdings, as applicable, than such other Person or group
and do not have the right or ability by voting power, contract or otherwise to elect or
designate for election a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company or TRW
Automotive Holdings, as applicable.

In the event that at the time of such Change of Control the terms of the Bank Indebtedness restrict or
prohibit the repurchase of senior notes pursuant to this covenant, then prior to the mailing of the
notice to holders provided for in the immediately following paragraph but in any event within 30 days
following any Change of Control, the Company shall:

(1) repay in full all Bank Indebtedness; or

(2) obtain the requisite consent, if required, under the agreements governing the Bank
Indebtedness to permit the repurchase of the senior notes as provided for in the
immediately following paragraph.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Company has
exercised its right to redeem the senior notes as described under ‘‘—Optional redemption,’’ the
Company shall mail a notice (a ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) to each holder with a copy to the Trustee
stating:

(1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such holder has the right to require the
Company to purchase such holder’s senior notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on a
record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date);

(2) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding such Change of
Control;

(3) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from
the date such notice is mailed); and

(4) the instructions determined by the Company, consistent with this covenant, that a holder
must follow in order to have its senior notes purchased.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the senior indentures applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by the Company and purchases all senior notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
under such Change of Control Offer.

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of
senior notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Company will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this
paragraph by virtue thereof.

This Change of Control repurchase provision is a result of negotiations between the Company and
the Initial Purchasers. The Company has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a

128


-----

Change of Control, although it is possible that the Company could decide to do so in the future.
Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the senior indentures, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Company’s capital structure or credit ratings.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control would constitute a default
under the Credit Agreement. Future Senior Indebtedness of the Company may contain prohibitions
on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Senior Indebtedness to
be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to
require the Company to repurchase the senior notes could cause a default under such Senior
Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such
repurchase on the Company. Finally, the Company’s ability to pay cash to the holders upon a
repurchase may be limited by the Company’s then existing financial resources. There can be no
assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of ‘‘all or
substantially all’’ the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is
a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of senior
notes to require the Company to repurchase such senior notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer
of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another
Person or group may be uncertain.

#### Certain covenants
The senior indentures contain covenants including, among others, the following:

_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock._
The senior indentures provide that:

(1) the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue any shares
of Disqualified Stock; and

(2) the Company will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of
Preferred Stock;

_provided, however, that the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor may Incur_
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock and any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor may issue shares of Preferred Stock, in each case if the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for
which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such
additional Indebtedness is Incurred or such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would
have been at least 2.00 to 1.00 determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of
the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been Incurred, or the Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of proceeds
therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

The foregoing limitations will not apply to:

(a) the Incurrence by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under
the Credit Agreement and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder (with letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances being
deemed to have a principal amount equal to the face amount thereof) up to an
aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion outstanding at any one time;

(b) the Incurrence by the Company and the Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by
(1) the senior notes (not including any additional senior notes) and the Senior
Guarantees, as applicable, and (2) the Senior Subordinated Notes and the related
guarantees, as applicable;

129


-----

(c) Indebtedness existing on the Acquisition Date (other than Indebtedness described in
clauses (a) and (b));

(d) Indebtedness (including Capitalized Lease Obligations) Incurred by the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to finance the purchase, lease or improvement of
property (real or personal) or equipment (whether through the direct purchase of
assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets (but no other material
assets)) in an aggregate principal amount which, when aggregated with the principal
amount of all other Indebtedness then outstanding and Incurred pursuant to this
clause (d), does not exceed 5% of Total Assets at the time of Incurrence;

(e) Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
constituting reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit issued in the
ordinary course of business, including without limitation letters of credit in respect of
workers’ compensation claims, health, disability or other employee benefits or
property, casualty or liability insurance or self-insurance, or other Indebtedness with
respect to reimbursement type obligations regarding workers’ compensation claims;
_provided, however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit, such obligations_
are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing;

(f) Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
providing for indemnification, adjustment of purchase price or similar obligations, in
each case, Incurred in connection with the disposition of any business, assets or a
Subsidiary of the Company in accordance with the terms of the senior indentures,
other than guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring all or any
portion of such business, assets or Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such
acquisition;

(g) Indebtedness of the Company to a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that any such
Indebtedness is subordinated in right of payment to the senior notes; provided further
that any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event
which results in any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary
of the Company or any other subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness (except
to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case to
be an Incurrence of such Indebtedness;

(h) shares of Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary issued to the Company or
another Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; provided that any subsequent
issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
Restricted Subsidiary that holds such shares of Preferred Stock of another Restricted
Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary, or any other subsequent transfer of
any such shares of Preferred Stock (except to the Company or another Restricted
Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to be an issuance of shares of Preferred
Stock;

(i) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted
Subsidiary; provided that (i) any such Indebtedness is made pursuant to an
intercompany note and (ii) if a Guarantor incurs such Indebtedness to a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor such Indebtedness is subordinated in right of
payment to the Senior Guarantee of such Guarantor; provided further that any
subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event which
results in any Restricted Subsidiary lending such Indebtedness ceasing to be a
Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness
(except to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each
case, to be an Incurrence of such Indebtedness;

130


-----

(j) Hedging Obligations that are Incurred in the ordinary course of business (and not for
speculative purposes): (1) for the purpose of fixing or hedging interest rate risk with
respect to any Indebtedness that is permitted by the terms of the senior indentures to
be outstanding; (2) for the purpose of fixing or hedging currency exchange rate risk
with respect to any currency exchanges; or (3) for the purpose of fixing or hedging
commodity price risk with respect to any commodity purchases;

(k) obligations in respect of performance, bid and surety bonds and completion
guarantees provided by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary
course of business;

(l) Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary not
otherwise permitted hereunder in an aggregate principal amount, which when
aggregated with the principal amount or liquidation preference of all other
Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock then outstanding and Incurred pursuant to this
clause (l), does not exceed $250 million at any one time outstanding (it being
understood that any Indebtedness Incurred under this clause (l) shall cease to be
deemed Incurred or outstanding for purposes of this clause (l) but shall be deemed
Incurred for purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first
date on which the Company, or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, could
have Incurred such Indebtedness under the first paragraph of this covenant without
reliance upon this clause (l));

(m) any guarantee by the Company or a Guarantor of Indebtedness or other obligations
of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries so long as the Incurrence of
such Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is
permitted under the terms of the senior indentures; provided that if such
Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the senior
notes or the Senior Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, any such
guarantee of such Guarantor with respect to such Indebtedness shall be
subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Senior Guarantee with respect
to the senior notes substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is
subordinated to the senior notes or the Senior Guarantee of such Restricted
Subsidiary, as applicable;

(n) the Incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness
which serves to refund or refinance any Indebtedness Incurred as permitted under
the first paragraph of this covenant and clauses (b), (c), (d) and (o) of this paragraph
or any Indebtedness issued to so refund or refinance such Indebtedness (subject to
the following proviso, ‘‘Refinancing Indebtedness’’) prior to its respective maturity;
_provided, however, that such Refinancing Indebtedness:_

(1) has a Weighted Average Life to Maturity at the time such Refinancing
Indebtedness is Incurred which is not less than the remaining Weighted
Average Life to Maturity of the Indebtedness being refunded or refinanced;

(2) has a Stated Maturity which is no earlier than the Stated Maturity of the
Indebtedness being refunded or refinanced;

(3) to the extent such Refinancing Indebtedness refinances Indebtedness junior to
the senior notes or the Senior Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, as
applicable, such Refinancing Indebtedness is junior to the senior notes or the
Senior Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable;

(4) is Incurred in an aggregate principal amount (or if issued with original issue
discount, an aggregate issue price) that is equal to or less than the aggregate

131


-----

principal amount (or if issued with original issue discount, the aggregate
accreted value) then outstanding of the Indebtedness being refinanced plus
premium and fees Incurred in connection with such refinancing; and

(5) shall not include (x) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor that refinances Indebtedness of the Company, or (y) Indebtedness of
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary that refinances Indebtedness of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

_provided further that subclauses (1) and (2) of this clause (n) will not apply to any_
refunding or refinancing of any Secured Indebtedness; and provided further that
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance, directly or indirectly, the Lucas Bonds, shall be
deemed to satisfy the requirements of this clause (n), provided that (A) such
Indebtedness has a Stated Maturity no earlier than February 15, 2013, in the case of
Indebtedness Incurred by the Company, and no earlier than August 15, 2013, in the
case of Indebtedness Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary, (B) the principal amount
of such Indebtedness does not exceed the then outstanding principal amount of the
Lucas Bonds, unless such excess could otherwise be incurred under this ‘‘Limitation
on the Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock’’ covenant and (C) in the event that such Indebtedness is issued upon the
drawing of a Qualified Letter of Credit, the proceeds of such drawing are either used
to repay the Lucas Bonds or are held in an escrow account pending such application.

(o) Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of Persons that are acquired by the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or merged into a Restricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the terms of the senior indentures; provided, however, that such
Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is not Incurred in contemplation of such
acquisition or merger or to provide all or a portion of the funds or credit support
required to consummate such acquisition or merger; provided further, however, that
after giving effect to such acquisition and the Incurrence of such Indebtedness either:

(1) the Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the
first sentence of this covenant; or

(2) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be greater than immediately prior to
such acquisition;

(p) Indebtedness Incurred by a Receivables Subsidiary in a Qualified Receivables
Financing that is not recourse to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company other than a Receivables Subsidiary (except for Standard Securitization
Undertakings);

(q) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a
check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary
course of business, provided that such Indebtedness is extinguished within two
Business Days of its Incurrence;

(r) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company
supported by a letter of credit issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement, in a principal
amount not in excess of the stated amount of such letter of credit;

(s) Contribution Indebtedness; and

(t) (a) if the Company could Incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph hereof after giving effect to such borrowing, Indebtedness of Foreign
Subsidiaries not otherwise permitted hereunder or (b) if the Company could not Incur
$1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph hereof after giving
effect to such borrowing, Indebtedness of Foreign Subsidiaries Incurred for working

132


-----

capital purposes, in either case in an aggregate principal amount, which when
aggregated with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness then outstanding and
Incurred pursuant to this clause (t), does not exceed the greater of (x) $400 million
and (y) 10% of the consolidated assets of the Foreign Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Guarantor may Incur any Indebtedness
pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph if the proceeds thereof are used, directly or
indirectly, to repay, prepay, redeem, defease, retire, refund or refinance any Subordinated
Indebtedness unless such Indebtedness will be subordinated to the senior notes or such Guarantor’s
Senior Guarantee, as applicable, to at least the same extent as such Subordinated Indebtedness.
For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness
meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness described in clauses
(a) through (t) above or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the
Company shall, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify such item of Indebtedness in any manner
that complies with this covenant and such item of Indebtedness will be treated as having been
Incurred pursuant to only one of such clauses or pursuant to the first paragraph hereof. Accrual of
interest, the accretion of accreted value and the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant.

_Limitation on Restricted Payments._ The senior indentures provide that the Company will not, and
will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on account of the Company’s or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests, including any payment made in connection
with any merger or consolidation involving the Company (other than (A) dividends or
distributions by the Company payable solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified
Stock) of the Company; or (B) dividends or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long
as, in the case of any dividend or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or
series of securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly Owned
Restricted Subsidiary, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro
rata share of such dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such
class or series of securities);

(2) purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of TRW Automotive
Holdings, TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings or the Company;

(3) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or
retire for value, in each case prior to any scheduled repayment or scheduled maturity, any
Subordinated Indebtedness (other than the payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance,
acquisition or retirement of (A) Subordinated Indebtedness in anticipation of satisfying a
sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one
year of the date of such payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or
retirement and (B) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (g) and (i) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’); or

(4) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively
referred to as ‘‘Restricted Payments’’), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment:

(a) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur
as a consequence thereof;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, the
Company could Incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness under the provisions of the
first paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock;’’ and

133


-----

(c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Payments made by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date
(including Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (1), (4) (only to the extent of
one-half of the amounts paid pursuant to such clause), (6) and (8) of the next
succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the
next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of, without duplication;

(1) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Company for the period (taken as
one accounting period) from January 1, 2003 to the end of the Company’s most
recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available
at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, in the case such Consolidated Net
Income for such period is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit); plus

(2) 100% of the aggregate net proceeds, including cash and the Fair Market Value
(as determined in accordance with the next succeeding sentence) of property
other than cash, received by the Company since the Issue Date from the issue
or sale of Equity Interests of the Company (excluding Refunding Capital Stock
(as defined below), Designated Preferred Stock, Excluded Contributions and
Disqualified Stock), including Equity Interests issued upon conversion of
Indebtedness or upon exercise of warrants or options (other than an issuance
or sale to a Subsidiary of the Company or an employee stock ownership plan or
trust established by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries); plus

(3) 100% of the aggregate amount of contributions to the capital of the Company
received in cash and the Fair Market Value (as determined in accordance with

notes—Certain Covenants—Assets Sales;’’ provided that, all Senior Notes tendered by
holders of the Senior Notes in connection with a Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale
Offer, as applicable, have been repurchased, redeemed or acquired for value.

_provided, however, that at the time of, and after giving effect to, any Restricted Payment permitted_
under clauses (6), (7), (10), (11) and (16), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, in no event shall any of the foregoing clauses (1) through (16) or any other Restricted
Payment permitted under this covenant be used or relied upon for purposes of (x) making any
payment in respect of, or otherwise servicing the obligations represented by, the Seller Note or (y)
making any payment to fund, or otherwise in respect of, an Accelerated Monitoring Fee Payment,
unless in the case of clause (y), prior to such payment either (i) a public Equity Offering by the

and all senior notes held by holders that have exercised their right to require the Company to
purchase such holders’ notes in accordance with the covenant described under ‘‘—Change of
Control’’ have been purchased prior to such payment being made.

As of the Acquisition Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries were Restricted Subsidiaries and are
currently Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to
become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the definition of ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary.’’ For
purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding
Investments by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the
Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount determined as set
forth in the last sentence of the definition of ‘‘Investments.’’ Such designation will only be permitted if
a Restricted Payment in such amount would be permitted at such time and if such Subsidiary
otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries._ The senior indentures provide that
the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or
consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (1) on its Capital Stock; or (2) with respect to any other
interest or participation in, or by, its profits; or (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(b) make loans or advances to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries;

except in each case for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(1) contractual encumbrances or restrictions in effect on the Acquisition Date, including
pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the other Senior Credit Documents;

(2) the senior indentures, the senior notes, the Senior Subordinated Notes and the indentures
relating to the Senior Subordinated Notes;

(3) applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order;

(4) any agreement or other instrument relating to Indebtedness of a Person acquired by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary which was in existence at the time of such
acquisition (but not created in contemplation thereof or to provide all or any portion of the
funds or credit support utilized to consummate such acquisition), which encumbrance or
restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other
than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired;

138


-----

(5) any restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to an agreement
entered into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets
of such Restricted Subsidiary pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(6) Secured Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenants
described under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
Stock and Preferred Stock’’ and ‘‘—Liens’’ that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the
assets securing such Indebtedness;

(7) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts
entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) customary provisions in joint venture agreements and other similar agreements entered
into in the ordinary course of business;

(9) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business that
impose restrictions of the nature discussed in clause (c) above on the property so
acquired;

(10) customary provisions contained in leases and other similar agreements entered into in the
ordinary course of business that impose restrictions of the type described in clause (c)
above;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction of a Receivables Subsidiary effected in connection with a
Qualified Receivables Financing; provided, however, that such restrictions apply only to
such Receivables Subsidiary;

(12) other Indebtedness of Restricted Subsidiaries (i) that are Guarantors that is Incurred
subsequent to the Acquisition Date pursuant to the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation
on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ or
(ii) that is Incurred subsequent to the Acquisition Date pursuant to clauses (d), (l) or (t) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ by Foreign
Subsidiaries; or

(13) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above
imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or
obligations referred to in clauses (1) through (12) above; provided that such amendments,
modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements
or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Company, no more restrictive with
respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in the
dividend or other payment restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement,
renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing.

_Asset Sales._ The senior indentures provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, cause or make an Asset Sale, unless (x) the Company, or its Restricted
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least
equal to the Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Company) of the assets sold or
otherwise disposed of, and (y) at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by the Company,
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalents; provided that
the amount of:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most
recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto) of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the senior
notes) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets;

139


-----

(b) any notes or other obligations or other securities or assets received by the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days of the receipt
thereof (to the extent of the cash received); and

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value,
taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant
to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of 2.5% of
Total Assets or $100 million at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash
Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value)

shall be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for the purposes of this provision.

Within 365 days after the Company’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Proceeds of
any Asset Sale, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary may apply the Net Proceeds from such
Asset Sale, at its option:

(1) to permanently reduce Obligations under the Credit Agreement (and, in the case of
revolving Obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto) or
other Senior Indebtedness (provided that if the Company shall so reduce Obligations
under Senior Indebtedness, it will equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the senior
notes by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset
Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, the pro
rata principal amount of senior notes) or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is
not a Guarantor, in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or an
Affiliate of the Company;

(2) to an investment in any one or more businesses (provided that such investment in any
business may be in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock so long as it results in the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, owning substantially all the
Capital Stock of such business), or capital expenditures, in each case used or useful in a
Similar Business; and/or

(3) to make an investment in any one or more businesses (provided that such investment in
any business may be in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock so long as it results in
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, owning substantially all the
Capital Stock of such business), properties or assets that replace the properties and
assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale.

Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
may temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise invest such
Net Proceeds in Cash Equivalents or Investment Grade Securities. The senior indentures will provide
that any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale that are not applied as provided and within the time
period set forth in the first sentence of this paragraph (it being understood that any portion of such
Net Proceeds used to make an offer to purchase senior notes, as described in clause (1) above,
shall be deemed to have been invested whether or not such offer is accepted) will be deemed to
constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds.’’ When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $20.0
million, the Company shall make an offer to all holders of senior notes (an ‘‘Asset Sale Offer’’) to
purchase the maximum principal amount of senior notes, that is an integral multiple of $1,000 or
t1,000, as applicable, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash
in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the senior indentures. The Company will commence an Asset Sale Offer with
respect to Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceeds

140


-----

$20.0 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the senior indentures, with a
copy to the Trustee. To the extent that the aggregate amount of senior notes tendered pursuant to an
Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess
Proceeds for general corporate purposes. If the aggregate principal amount of senior notes
surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the
senior notes to be purchased in the manner described below. Upon completion of any such Asset
Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the senior notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that
the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the senior
indentures, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not
be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the senior indentures by virtue thereof.

If more senior notes are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer than the Company is required to
purchase, selection of such senior notes for purchase will be made by the Trustee in compliance with
the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which such senior notes are
listed, or if such senior notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as
the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal
requirements); provided that no senior notes of $1,000 or less or t1,000 or less, as applicable, shall
be purchased in part.

Notices of an Asset Sale Offer shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 but not
more than 60 days before the purchase date to each holder of senior notes at such holder’s
registered address. If any senior note is to be purchased in part only, any notice of purchase that
relates to such senior note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is
to be purchased.

A new senior note in principal amount equal to the unpurchased portion of any senior note purchased
in part will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original senior note.
On and after the purchase date, unless the Company defaults in payment of the purchase price,
interest shall cease to accrue on senior notes or portions thereof purchased.

_Transactions with Affiliates._ The senior indentures provide that the Company will not, and will not
permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or sell, lease,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets
from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction or series of transactions, contract, agreement,
understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company
(each of the foregoing, an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate consideration in excess of $15
million, unless:

(a) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the
Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been
obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
with an unrelated Person; and

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions
involving aggregate consideration in excess of $30 million, the Company delivers to
the Trustee a resolution adopted in good faith by the majority of the Board of
Directors of the Company, approving such Affiliate Transaction and set forth in an
Officers’ Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (a)
above.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(1) transactions between or among the Company and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) Restricted Payments permitted by the provisions of the senior indentures described above
under the covenant ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments;’’

141

Company in good faith;

(6) transactions in which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such
transaction is fair to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of
view or meets the requirements of clause (a) of the preceding paragraph;

(7) payments or loans to employees or consultants in the ordinary course of business which
are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith;

(8) any agreement (other than with Blackstone or its Affiliates) as in effect as of the
Acquisition Date or any amendment thereto (so long as any such amendment is not
disadvantageous to the holders of the senior notes in any material respect) or any
transaction contemplated thereby;

(9) the existence of, or the performance by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
of its obligations under the terms of, Acquisition Documents, any stockholders agreement
(including any registration rights agreement or purchase agreement related thereto) to
which it is a party as of the Acquisition Date and any amendment thereto or similar
agreements which it may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or
the performance by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations
under any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar
agreement entered into after the Acquisition Date shall only be permitted by this clause (9)
to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise
disadvantageous to the holders of the senior notes in any material respect;

(10) the payment of all fees and expenses related to the Transactions, including fees to
Blackstone, which are described in this list memorandum;

(11) (a) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or

the terms of the senior indentures, which are fair to the Company and its Restricted

management of the Company, and are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably
have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party or (b) transactions with
Unrestricted Subsidiaries and joint ventures for the purchase or sale of automotive goods,
products, parts and services entered into in the ordinary course of business and in a
manner consistent with past practice;

(12) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing; and

(13) the issuance of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company, TRW
Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings to any Permitted Holder.

_Liens._ The senior indentures provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien on any asset
or property of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, or any income or profits therefrom, or

142


-----

assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, that secures any obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries unless the senior notes are equally and ratably secured with (or on a senior
basis to, in the case of obligations subordinated in right of payment to the senior notes) the
obligations so secured or until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien. The
preceding sentence will not require the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to secure the senior
notes if the Lien consists of a Permitted Lien.

The senior indentures provide that no Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor will directly or
indirectly create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien on any asset or property of such Guarantor or any
income or profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, that secures
any obligation of such Guarantor unless the Senior Guarantee of such Guarantor is equally and
ratably secured with (or on a senior basis to, in the case of obligations subordinated on right of
payment to such Guarantor’s Senior Guarantee) the obligations so secured or until such time as
such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien. The preceding sentence will not require any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to secure its Senior Guarantee if the Lien consists of a
Permitted Lien.

_Reports and other information._ The senior indentures provide that notwithstanding that the
Company may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and
quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the Company will,

the SEC), such other reports on Form 8-K (or any successor or comparable form); and

(4) any other information, documents and other reports which the Company would be required
to file with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;

_provided, however, the Company shall not be so obligated to file such reports with the SEC if the_
SEC does not permit such filing, in which event the Company will make available such information to
prospective purchasers of senior notes, in addition to providing such information to the Trustees and
the holders, in each case within 15 days after the time the Company would be required to file such
information with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, such requirements shall be deemed satisfied prior to the
commencement of the Exchange Offer (as defined) or the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration
Statement (as defined) by the filing with the SEC of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as
defined) and/or Shelf Registration Statement, and any amendments thereto, with such financial
information that satisfies Regulation S-X of the Securities Act. In the event that:

(a) the rules and regulations of the SEC permit the Company and TRW Automotive
Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings to report at the TRW Automotive
Holdings’ or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings’ level on a consolidated basis
and

(b) TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings’, as applicable,
is not engaged in any business in any material respect other than incidental to its
ownership, directly or indirectly, of the capital stock of the Company,

143


-----

such consolidated reporting at the TRW Automotive Holdings’ or TRW Automotive Intermediate
Holdings’ level, as applicable, in a manner consistent with that described in this covenant for the
Company will satisfy this covenant.

_Future guarantors._ The senior indentures will provide that the Company will cause each Wholly
Owned Restricted Subsidiary that is a Domestic Subsidiary (unless such Subsidiary is a Receivables
Subsidiary) that:

(a) guarantees any Indebtedness of TRW Automotive Holdings, the Company or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(b) Incurs any Indebtedness or issues any shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock permitted to be Incurred or issued pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance
of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ or clauses (a), (l) or (s) of the second
paragraph thereof or not permitted to be Incurred by such covenant:

to execute and deliver to the Trustee supplemental indentures pursuant to which such Subsidiary will
guarantee payment of the senior notes. In addition, the senior indentures will provide that the
Company will cause each non-wholly owned Domestic Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary that
guarantees any Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement to execute and deliver to the Trustee
supplemental indentures pursuant to which such Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the senior
notes. Each Senior Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that
can be guaranteed by that Restricted Subsidiary without rendering the Senior Guarantee, as it relates
to such Restricted Subsidiary, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.

The indentures will also provide that if TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate
Holdings is engaged in any business in any material respect other than incidental to its ownership,
directly or indirectly, of the capital stock of the Company or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings,
as applicable, or acquires any assets that are material, other than capital stock of the Company or
TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings, as applicable, TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive
Intermediate Holdings, as applicable, will execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture pursuant to which TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings, as
applicable, will guarantee payment of the senior notes.

#### Merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets

The senior indentures provide that the Company may not consolidate or merge with or into or wind
up into (whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease,
convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more
related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) the Company is the surviving corporation or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment,
transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation,
partnership or limited liability company organized or existing under the laws of the United
States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof (the Company or
such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the ‘‘Successor Company’’);

(2) the Successor Company (if other than the Company) expressly assumes all the obligations
of the Company under the senior indentures and the senior notes pursuant to
supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which
becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as
a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction) no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing;

144


-----

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, as if such transaction had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, either

(a) the Successor Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first
sentence of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ or

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Successor Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would be greater than such ratio for the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction;

(5) each Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, shall have
by supplemental indentures confirmed that its Senior Guarantee shall apply to such
Person’s obligations under the senior indentures and the senior notes; and

(6) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indentures (if any) comply with the senior indentures.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Company under the senior
indentures and the senior notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4), (a) any
Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and
assets to the Company or to another Restricted Subsidiary, and (b) the Company may merge with an
Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Company in another state of the
United States so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
is not increased thereby.

The senior indentures further provide that subject to certain limitations in the senior indentures
governing release of a Senior Guarantee upon the sale or disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that
is a Guarantor, each such Guarantor will not, and the Company will not permit such a Guarantor to,
consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of
its properties or assets in one or more related transactions to, any Person unless:

(1) such Guarantor is the surviving corporation or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment,
transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation,
partnership or limited liability company organized or existing under the laws of the United
States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof (such Guarantor
or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the ‘‘Successor Guarantor’’);

(2) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor) expressly assumes all the
obligations of such Guarantor under the senior indentures and such Guarantors’s Senior
Guarantee pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which
becomes an obligation of the Successor Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of
such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Guarantor or such Subsidiary
at the time of such transaction) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing; and

(4) such Guarantor shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to the Trustee an Officers’
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or
transfer and such supplemental indentures (if any) comply with the senior indentures.

The senior indentures also contain similar provisions governing the release of the Senior Guarantees,
if any, by TRW Automotive Holdings and TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings. Subject to certain
limitations described in the senior indentures, the Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be

145


-----

substituted for, such Guarantor under the senior indentures and such Guarantor’s Senior Guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Guarantor may merge with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the
purpose of reincorporating such Guarantor in another state of the United States so long as the
amount of Indebtedness of the Guarantor is not increased thereby.

#### Defaults

An Event of Default is defined in the senior indentures as:

(1) a default in any payment of interest on any senior note when due continued for 30 days;

(2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of any senior note when due at its
Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or
otherwise, whether or not such payment is prohibited by the provisions described under
‘‘—Ranking’’ above;

(3) the failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under the covenant described
under ‘‘—Merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets’’ above;

(4) the failure by the Company to comply for 30 days after notice with any of its obligations
under the covenants described under ‘‘—Change of Control’’ or ‘‘—Certain covenants’’
above (in each case, other than a failure to purchase senior notes);

(5) the failure by the Company to comply for 60 days after notice with its other agreements
contained in the senior notes or the senior indentures;

(6) the failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary to pay any Indebtedness (other
than Indebtedness owing to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within any applicable
grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the
holders thereof because of a default if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or
accelerated exceeds $50.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent (the ‘‘cross
acceleration provision’’); provided, however, that no Event of Default shall be deemed to
arise under the senior indentures with respect to the acceleration of the Lucas Bonds so
long as not later than two Business Days after the date of any such acceleration and at all
times thereafter until the Lucas Bonds have been repaid in full or such acceleration has
been withdrawn, revoked or annulled, a Qualified Letter of Credit has been issued and
remains in effect;

(7) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant
Subsidiary (the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’);

(8) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of $50.0 million (net of any amounts which are covered by enforceable insurance
policies issued by solvent carriers), which judgments are not discharged, waived or stayed
for a period of 60 days (the ‘‘judgment default provision’’); or

(9) any Senior Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect
(except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms its
obligations under the senior indentures or any Senior Guarantee and such Default
continues for 10 days.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and
whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment,
decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental
body.

However, a default under clause (4) or (5) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or
the holders of 25% in principal amount of either issue of senior notes notify the Company of the
default and the Company does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (4) and (5)
hereof after receipt of such notice.

146


-----

If an Event of Default (other than a Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization of the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25%
in principal amount of either issue of senior notes by notice to the Company may declare the
principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the senior notes of such issue to
be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable
immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization of the Company occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the senior
notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of
the Trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount
of either issue of senior notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to such senior notes
and its consequences.

Subject to the provisions of the senior indentures relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an
Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of
the rights or powers under the senior indentures at the request or direction of any of the holders
unless such holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss,
liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or
interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the senior indentures or the
senior notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the senior notes of the applicable issue
have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss,
liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the
request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the senior notes of such issue have not
given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of either issue of senior
notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The
Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the senior indentures or
that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would
involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the senior indentures, the
Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and
expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The senior indentures provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the
Trustee, the Trustee must mail to each holder of dollar senior notes or euro senior notes, as
applicable, notice of the Default within the earlier of 90 days after it occurs or 30 days after it is
actually known to a Trust Officer or written notice of it is received by the Trustee. Except in the case
of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on any senior note, the
Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith
determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the noteholders. In addition, the Company is
required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate
indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year.
The Company also is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof,
written notice of any event which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the
Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

#### Amendments and waivers

Subject to certain exceptions, the senior indentures may be amended with the consent of the holders
of a majority in principal amount of the dollar senior notes or the euro senior notes, as applicable,

147


-----

then outstanding and any past default or compliance with any provisions may be waived with the
consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the dollar senior notes or the euro senior
notes, as applicable, then outstanding. However, without the consent of each holder of an senior note
affected, no amendment may, among other things:

(1) reduce the amount of senior notes whose holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any senior note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any senior note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any senior note or change the time
at which any senior note may be redeemed as described under ‘‘Optional redemption’’
above;

(5) make any senior note payable in money other than that stated in such senior note;

(6) impair the right of any holder to receive payment of principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on such holder’s senior notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit
for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder’s senior notes;

(7) make any change in the amendment provisions which require each holder’s consent or in
the waiver provisions; or

(8) modify the Senior Guarantees in any manner adverse to the holders.

Without the consent of any holder, the Company and Trustee may amend the senior indentures to
cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, to provide for the assumption by a successor
corporation, partnership or limited liability company of the obligations of the Company under the
senior indentures, to provide for uncertificated senior notes in addition to or in place of certificated
senior notes (provided that the uncertificated senior notes are issued in registered form for purposes
of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated senior notes are described
in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code), to add Senior Guarantees with respect to the senior notes, to
secure the senior notes, to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the holders or to
surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company, to make any change that does not
adversely affect the rights of any holder, to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection
with the qualification of the senior indentures under the TIA or to make certain changes to the senior
indentures to provide for the issuance of additional senior notes.

The consent of the noteholders is not necessary under the senior indentures to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of
the proposed amendment.

After an amendment under the senior indentures becomes effective, the Company is required to mail
to the respective noteholders a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to
give such notice to all noteholders entitled to receive such notice, or any defect therein, will not
impair or affect the validity of the amendment.

#### Transfer and exchange
A noteholder may transfer or senior notes in accordance with the senior indentures. Upon any
transfer or exchange, the registrar and the Trustee may require a noteholder, among other things, to
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Company may require a
noteholder to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the senior indentures. The Company is
not required to transfer or exchange any senior note selected for redemption or to transfer or
exchange any senior note for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of senior notes to be redeemed.
The senior notes will be issued in registered form and the registered holder of senior note will be
treated as the owner of such senior note for all purposes.

#### Defeasance
The Company at any time may terminate all its obligations under the senior notes and the senior
indentures (‘‘legal defeasance’’), except for certain obligations, including those respecting the

148


-----

defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the senior notes, to replace
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen senior notes and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in
respect of the senior notes. The Company at any time may terminate its obligations under the
provisions described under ‘‘Change of Control,’’ under the covenants described under ‘‘Certain
covenants,’’ the operation of the cross acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions with respect
to Subsidiaries and the judgment default provision described under ‘‘—Defaults’’ above and the
limitations contained under ‘‘Merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets’’ above
(‘‘covenant defeasance’’). If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant
defeasance option, each Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its
Senior Guarantee.

The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its
covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
senior notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the
Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the senior notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3), (4), (6), (7) with respect only to
Significant Subsidiaries, (8) with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries or (9) under ‘‘—Defaults’’
above or because of the failure of the Company to comply with ‘‘—Merger, consolidation or sale of all
or substantially all assets’’ above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
‘‘defeasance trust’’) with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of
principal, premium (if any) and interest on the applicable issue of senior notes to redemption or
maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the
Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that holders of the senior notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance
and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in
the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal
Revenue Service or change in applicable Federal income tax law).

Company as Registrar and a Paying Agent with regard to the senior notes.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, consolidations and discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP), in
each case with respect to an operating unit of a business, that have been made by the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such
reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Calculation Date shall be calculated on
a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, discontinued
operations, mergers and consolidations (and the change of any associated fixed charge obligations
and the change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter
reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary since the
beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, discontinued
operation, merger or consolidation, in each case with respect to an operating unit of a business, that
would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition,
disposition, discontinued operation, merger or consolidation had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any transaction, the pro
forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the
Company. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect,
the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date
had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations
applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term in excess of 12
months). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate
reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company to be the rate
of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of
making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit
facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of
such Indebtedness during the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be
determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency
interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually
chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company may designate. Any
such pro forma calculation may include adjustments appropriate, in the reasonable determination of
the Company as set forth in an Officers’ Certificate, to reflect operating expense reductions
reasonably expected to result from any acquisition or merger.

‘‘Fixed Charges’’ means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum of:

(1) Consolidated Interest Expense of such Person for such period; and

(2) all cash dividend payments (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any series of

Accountants and statements and pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board or in

indentures, the term ‘‘consolidated’’ with respect to any Person shall mean such Person consolidated
with its Restricted Subsidiaries, and shall not include any Unrestricted Subsidiary, but the interest of
such Person in an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be accounted for as an Investment.

subordinated notes, and in denominations of t1,000 and any integral multiple of t1,000 in the case
of the euro senior subordinated notes. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer
or exchange of senior subordinated notes, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any transfer tax or other similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

#### Terms of the senior subordinated notes

The senior subordinated notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations of the Company and
will mature on February 15, 2013. Each senior subordinated note bears interest at a rate per annum
shown on the front cover of this listing memorandum from February 18, 2003 or from the most recent
date to which interest has been paid or provided for, payable semiannually to holders of record at the
close of business on the February 1 or August 1 immediately preceding the interest payment date on
February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2003. Interest on the senior
subordinated notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days
elapsed.

Additional interest is payable with respect to the senior subordinated notes in certain circumstances if
the exchange offers are not completed on or prior to 290 days after the Issue Date or if certain other
conditions are not satisfied. We have filed a registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the
exchange offers with the SEC on July 1, 2003.

#### Optional redemption

Except as set forth in the following paragraph, the senior subordinated notes will not be redeemable
at the option of the Company prior to February 15, 2008. Thereafter, the senior subordinated notes
will be redeemable, at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice mailed by first-class mail to each holder’s registered address, at the
following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount), plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if
redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on February 15 of the years set forth below:

In addition, at any time and from time to time prior to February 15, 2006, the Company may redeem
in the aggregate up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the dollar senior
subordinated notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional dollar senior
subordinated notes) with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings (1) by the Company
or (2) by TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings, in each case, to the
extent the net cash proceeds thereof are contributed to the Company or used to purchase Capital
Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company from it, at a redemption price (expressed as a
percentage of principal amount thereof) of 111.00% plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional

172


-----

interest, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that at least
65% of the original aggregate principal amount of the dollar senior subordinated notes (calculated
after giving effect to any issuance of additional dollar senior subordinated notes) must remain
outstanding after each such redemption and provided further that such redemption shall occur within
90 days after the date on which any such Equity Offering is consummated upon not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days’ notice mailed to each holder of dollar senior subordinated notes being redeemed
and otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the dollar senior subordinated
indenture. Additionally, at any time and from time to time prior to February 15, 2006, the Company
may redeem in the aggregate up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the euro senior
subordinated notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional euro senior
subordinated notes) with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings (1) by the Company
or (2) by TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings, in each case, to the
extent the net cash proceeds thereof are contributed to the Company or used to purchase Capital
Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company from it, at a redemption price (expressed as a
percentage of principal amount thereof) of 111.75% plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
interest, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that at least
65% of the original aggregate principal amount of the euro senior subordinated notes (calculated
after giving effect to any issuance of additional euro senior subordinated notes) must remain
outstanding after each such redemption and provided further that such redemption shall occur within
90 days after the date on which any such Equity Offering is consummated upon not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days’ notice mailed to each holder of euro senior subordinated notes being redeemed
and otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the euro senior subordinated indenture.

#### Selection

In the case of any partial redemption, selection of the senior subordinated notes for redemption will
be made by the Trustee in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities
exchange, if any, on which such senior subordinated notes are listed, or if such senior subordinated
notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem
fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements); provided
that no dollar senior subordinated notes of $1,000 or less, or euro senior subordinated notes of
t1,000 or less, shall be redeemed in part. If any senior subordinated note is to be redeemed in part
only, the notice of redemption relating to such senior subordinated note shall state the portion of the
principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new senior subordinated note in principal amount equal
to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation
of the original senior subordinated note. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to
accrue on senior subordinated notes or portions thereof called for redemption so long as the
Company has deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional interest (if any) on, the senior subordinated notes to be redeemed.

#### Ranking

The indebtedness evidenced by the senior subordinated notes are unsecured senior subordinated
indebtedness of the Company, are subordinated in right of payment, as set forth in the senior
subordinated indentures, to all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Company, rank pari
passu in right of payment with all existing and future Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Company and
are senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company.
The senior subordinated notes are also effectively subordinated to any Secured Indebtedness of the
Company to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Secured Indebtedness. However,
payment from the money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in any defeasance
trust described under ‘‘—Defeasance’’ below is not subordinated to any Senior Indebtedness or
subject to the restrictions described herein.

The indebtedness evidenced by the Senior Subordinated Guarantees are unsecured senior
subordinated indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor, are subordinated in right of payment, as set

173


-----

forth in the senior subordinated indentures, to all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such
Guarantor, rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Pari Passu Indebtedness of
such Guarantor and are senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated
Indebtedness of such Guarantor. The Senior Subordinated Guarantees are also effectively
subordinated to any Secured Indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor to the extent of the value of
the assets securing such Secured Indebtedness.

At June 27, 2003, as a result of the Transactions,

(1) the Company had $2,848 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Indebtedness
outstanding (excluding unused commitments), $1,520 million of which was Secured
Indebtedness;

(2) the Company had no Pari Passu Indebtedness outstanding (other than the senior
subordinated notes) and no Subordinated Indebtedness outstanding;

(3) the Company’s Subsidiaries had total indebtedness (excluding intercompany liabilities
and guarantees under the Credit Agreement) of $239 million;

(4) the Company had a short-term note payable to Northrop Grumman reflecting certain
estimated post-closing adjustments, subject to final negotiations; and

(5) there were no advances outstanding under the Company’s receivables facility.

Although the senior subordinated indentures contain limitations on the amount of additional
Indebtedness which the Company and its Subsidiaries may Incur, under certain circumstances the
amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial and, in any case, such Indebtedness may be
Senior Indebtedness. See ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
Stock and Preferred Stock’’ below.

Substantially all of the operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Unless the
Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and
claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally have priority with respect to
the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company, including
holders of the senior subordinated notes. The senior subordinated notes, therefore, are effectively
subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries
of the Company that are not Guarantors. Although the senior subordinated indentures limit the
Incurrence of Indebtedness by and the issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of certain
of the Company’s Subsidiaries, such limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications.

‘‘Senior Indebtedness’’ with respect to the Company or any Guarantor means all Indebtedness and
any Receivables Repurchase Obligation of the Company or such Guarantor, including interest
thereon (including interest accruing on or after the filing of any petition in bankruptcy or for
reorganization relating to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company at the rate specified in the
documentation with respect thereto whether or not a claim for post-filing interest is allowed in such
proceeding) and other amounts (including fees, expenses, reimbursement obligations under letters of
credit and indemnities) owing in respect thereof, whether outstanding on the Acquisition Date or
thereafter Incurred, unless in the instrument creating or evidencing the same or pursuant to which the
same is outstanding it is provided that such obligations are not superior, or are subordinated, in right
of payment to the senior subordinated notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee, as applicable; provided,
_however, that Senior Indebtedness shall not include, as applicable:_

(1) any obligation of the Company to any Subsidiary of the Company (other than any
Receivables Repurchase Obligation), or of such Guarantor to the Company or any
other Subsidiary of the Company;

(2) any liability for Federal, state, local or other taxes owed or owing by the Company or
such Guarantor;

(3) any accounts payable or other liability to trade creditors arising in the ordinary course
of business (including guarantees thereof or instruments evidencing such liabilities);

174


-----

(4) any Indebtedness or obligation of the Company or such Guarantor which is
subordinate or junior in any respect to any other Indebtedness or obligation of the
Company or such Guarantor, as applicable, including any Pari Passu Indebtedness
and any Subordinated Indebtedness;

(5) any obligations with respect to any Capital Stock; or

(6) any Indebtedness Incurred in violation of the senior subordinated indentures but, as to
any such Indebtedness Incurred under the Credit Agreement, no such violation shall
be deemed to exist for purposes of this clause (6) if the holders of such Indebtedness
or their representative shall have received an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness does not (or, in the case of a revolving credit facility
thereunder, the Incurrence of the entire committed amount thereof at the date on
which the initial borrowing thereunder is made would not) violate the senior
subordinated indentures.

If any Senior Indebtedness is disallowed, avoided or subordinated pursuant to the provisions of
Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any applicable state fraudulent conveyance law,
such Senior Indebtedness nevertheless will constitute Senior Indebtedness.

Only Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor that is Senior Indebtedness ranks senior to the
senior subordinated notes or the relevant Senior Subordinated Guarantee in accordance with the
provisions of the senior subordinated indentures. The senior subordinated notes and each Senior
Subordinated Guarantee in all respects rank pari passu with all other Pari Passu Indebtedness of the
Company and the relevant Guarantor, respectively.

The Company may not pay principal of, premium (if any) or interest on, the senior subordinated
notes or make any deposit pursuant to the provisions described under ‘‘—Defeasance’’ below and
may not otherwise purchase, redeem or otherwise retire any senior subordinated notes (except that
holders may receive and retain (a) Permitted Junior Securities and (b) payments made from the trust
described under ‘‘—Defeasance’’ below) (collectively, ‘‘pay the senior subordinated notes’’) if:

(1) a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any
Designated Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing or any other amount owing
in respect of any Designated Senior Indebtedness is not paid when due; or

(2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness occurs and the maturity of such
Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms unless, in
either case, the default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been
rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash or
Cash Equivalents.

However, the Company may pay the senior subordinated notes without regard to the foregoing if the
Company and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representative of
the Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which either of the events set forth in clause (1)
or (2) of the immediately preceding sentence has occurred and is continuing. During the continuance
of any default (other than a default described in clause (1) or (2) of the second preceding sentence)
with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be
accelerated immediately without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such
acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, the Company may not pay the senior
subordinated notes for a period (a ‘‘Payment Blockage Period’’) commencing upon the receipt by the
Trustee (with a copy to the Company) of written notice (a ‘‘Blockage Notice’’) of such default from the
Representative of the Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment
Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter (or earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is
terminated (1) by written notice to the Trustee and the Company from the Person or Persons who
gave such Blockage Notice; (2) by repayment in full in cash or Cash Equivalents of such Designated
Senior Indebtedness; or (3) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is no longer
continuing). Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding sentence (but
subject to the provisions contained in the first sentence of this paragraph and in the succeeding

175


-----

paragraph), unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of
such holders have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, the Company
may resume payments on the senior subordinated notes after the end of such Payment Blockage
Period. Not more than one Blockage Notice may be given in any consecutive 360-day period,
irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness during such
period. However, if any Blockage Notice within such 360-day period is given by or on behalf of any
holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness other than the Bank Indebtedness, the Representative of
the Bank Indebtedness may give one additional Blockage Notice within such period. In no event,
however, may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in
effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any 360 consecutive day period. For purposes of this
paragraph, no default or event of default that existed or was continuing on the date of the
commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior
Indebtedness initiating such Payment Blockage Period shall be, or be made, the basis of the
commencement of a subsequent Payment Blockage Period by the Representative of such
Designated Senior Indebtedness, whether or not within a period of 360 consecutive days, unless
such default or event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90
consecutive days.

Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of the Company upon a total or partial liquidation or
dissolution or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the Company or its property, the
holders of Senior Indebtedness will be entitled to receive payment in full in cash or Cash Equivalents
of the Senior Indebtedness (including interest accruing after, or which would accrue but for, the
commencement of any such proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Senior Indebtedness,
whether or not a claim for such interest would be allowed) before the noteholders are entitled to
receive any payment and until the Senior Indebtedness is paid in full in cash or Cash Equivalents,
any payment or distribution to which noteholders would be entitled but for the subordination
provisions of the senior subordinated indentures will be made to holders of the Senior Indebtedness
as their interests may appear (except that holders of senior subordinated notes may receive and
retain (1) Permitted Junior Securities, and (2) payments made from the trust described under
‘‘—Defeasance’’ so long as, on the date or dates the respective amounts were paid into the trust,
such payments were made with respect to the senior subordinated notes without violating the
subordination provisions described herein). If a distribution is made to noteholders that due to the
subordination provisions of the senior subordinated indentures should not have been made to them,
such noteholders are required to hold it in trust for the holders of Senior Indebtedness and pay it
over to them as their interests may appear.

If payment of either issue of senior subordinated notes is accelerated because of an Event of
Default, the Company or the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior
Indebtedness (or their Representative) of the acceleration. If any Designated Senior Indebtedness is
outstanding, the Company may not pay the relevant senior subordinated notes until five Business
Days after such holders or the Representative of the Designated Senior Indebtedness receive notice
of such acceleration and, thereafter, may pay the relevant senior subordinated notes only if the
subordination provisions of the applicable senior subordinated indenture otherwise permit payment at
that time.

By reason of such subordination provisions contained in the senior subordinated indentures, in the
event of insolvency, creditors of the Company who are holders of Senior Indebtedness may recover
more, ratably, than the noteholders, and creditors of the Company who are not holders of Senior
Indebtedness or of Pari Passu Indebtedness (including the senior subordinated notes) may recover
less, ratably, than holders of Senior Indebtedness and may recover more, ratably, than the holders of
Pari Passu Indebtedness.

The senior subordinated indentures contain substantially similar subordination provisions relating to
each Guarantor’s obligations under its Senior Subordinated Guarantee.

#### Senior subordinated guarantees

Each of the Company’s direct and indirect Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries that were Domestic
Subsidiaries (other than Receivables Subsidiaries) on the Acquisition Date and all future Wholly
Owned Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company that are Domestic Subsidiaries and all non-wholly
owned Domestic Subsidiaries that are Significant Subsidiaries, in each case that guarantee
Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement jointly and severally irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantee on an unsecured senior subordinated basis (in the same manner and to the same extent
that the senior subordinated notes are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness) the performance and
punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all
obligations of the Company under the senior subordinated indentures and the senior subordinated
notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or additional interest on the
senior subordinated notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed
by such Guarantors being herein called the ‘‘Guaranteed Obligations’’). Such Guarantors agree to
pay, in addition to the amount stated above, any and all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees
and expenses) Incurred by the Trustee or the holders in enforcing any rights under the Senior
Subordinated Guarantees. Additionally, (1) if, and so long as, TRW Automotive Luxembourg provides
a guarantee under the Credit Agreement, TRW Automotive Luxembourg will, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Luxembourg law, provide a Senior Subordinated Guarantee of the
Guaranteed Obligations and (2) if TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate
Holdings is engaged in any business in any material respect other than incidental to its ownership,
directly or indirectly, of the capital stock of the Company or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings,
as applicable, or acquires any assets that are material, other than capital stock of the Company or
TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings, as applicable, TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive
Intermediate Holdings, as applicable, will execute and deliver to the Trustee a Senior Subordinated
Guarantee pursuant to which TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings,
as applicable, will guarantee payment of the senior subordinated notes. Upon the release of TRW
Automotive Luxembourg’s guarantee under the Credit Agreement, TRW Automotive Luxembourg’s
Senior Subordinated Guarantee will be released and discharged at such time. In the event that TRW
Automotive Luxembourg thereafter guarantees Indebtedness of the Company under the Credit
Agreement, TRW Automotive Luxembourg will again provide a Senior Subordinated Guarantee of the
Guaranteed Obligations.

Each Senior Subordinated Guarantee is limited in amount to an amount not to exceed the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Guarantor without rendering the Senior
Subordinated Guarantee, as it relates to such Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
After the Acquisition Date, the Company will cause (1) each Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary that
is a Domestic Subsidiary (unless such Subsidiary is a Receivables Subsidiary) that Incurs or
guarantees certain Indebtedness or issues shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and (2)
each non-wholly owned Domestic Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary that guarantees
Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement to execute and deliver to the Trustee supplemental
indentures pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the senior
subordinated notes on the same unsecured senior subordinated basis. See ‘‘—Future guarantors’’
below.

Each Senior Subordinated Guarantee is a continuing guarantee and shall:

(1) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations;

(2) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, be binding upon each such Guarantor and
its successors; and

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders and their
successors, transferees and assigns.

177


-----

A Senior Subordinated Guarantee will be automatically released upon the sale (including through
merger or consolidation) of the Capital Stock, or all or substantially all the assets, of the applicable
Guarantor if:

(1) such sale is made in compliance with the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain
covenants—Assets Sales;’’ and

(2) such Guarantor is released from its guarantees, if any, of, and all pledges and
security, if any, granted in connection with, the Credit Agreement and any other
Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

A Senior Subordinated Guarantee also will be automatically released upon the applicable Subsidiary
ceasing to be a Subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing
Bank Indebtedness or other exercise of remedies in respect thereof or if such Subsidiary is released
from its guarantees of, and all pledges and security interests granted in connection with, the Credit
Agreement. In addition, a Senior Subordinated Guarantee made by any Restricted Subsidiary will be
automatically released if the Company designates such Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary and
such designation complies with the other applicable provisions of the applicable senior subordinated
indenture.

#### Change of control

Upon the occurrence of any of the following events (each, a ‘‘Change of Control’’), each holder will
have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s senior
subordinated notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), except to
the extent the Company has previously elected to redeem senior subordinated notes as described
under ‘‘—Optional redemption’’:

(1) the sale, lease or transfer, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or
substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to a
Person other than the Permitted Holders; or

(2) (A) the Company becomes aware (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) of the
acquisition by any Person or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or Section
14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, or any successor provision), including any group acting
for the purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of securities (within the meaning of
Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act), other than the Permitted Holders, in a
single transaction or in a related series of transactions, by way of merger,
consolidation or other business combination or purchase of beneficial ownership
(within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, or any successor
provision), of 35% or more of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the
Company or TRW Automotive Holdings and (B) the Permitted Holders beneficially own
(as defined above), directly or indirectly, in the aggregate a lesser percentage of the
total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Company or TRW Automotive Holdings,
as applicable, than such other Person or group and do not have the right or ability by
voting power, contract or otherwise to elect or designate for election a majority of the
Board of Directors of the Company or TRW Automotive Holdings, as applicable.

In the event that at the time of such Change of Control the terms of the Bank Indebtedness or other
Senior Indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, restrict or prohibit the repurchase of senior
subordinated notes pursuant to this covenant, then prior to the mailing of the notice to holders
provided for in the immediately following paragraph but in any event within 30 days following any
Change of Control, the Company shall:

(1) repay in full all Bank Indebtedness and such Senior Indebtedness; or

178


-----

(2) obtain the requisite consent, if required, under the agreements governing the Bank
Indebtedness and such Senior Indebtedness to permit the repurchase of the senior
subordinated notes as provided for in the immediately following paragraph.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Company has
exercised its right to redeem the senior subordinated notes as described under ‘‘—Optional
redemption,’’ the Company shall mail a notice (a ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) to each holder with a
copy to the Trustee stating:

(1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such holder has the right to require
the Company to purchase such holder’s senior subordinated notes at a purchase price
in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of
holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment
date);

(2) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding such Change
of Control;

(3) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days
from the date such notice is mailed); and

(4) the instructions determined by the Company, consistent with this covenant, that a
holder must follow in order to have its senior subordinated notes purchased.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the senior subordinated indentures applicable to a
Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all senior subordinated notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of
senior subordinated notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Company will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under this paragraph by virtue thereof.

This Change of Control repurchase provision is a result of negotiations between the Company and
the Initial Purchasers. The Company has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a
Change of Control, although it is possible that the Company could decide to do so in the future.
Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the senior subordinated indentures, but that could increase the amount of
indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Company’s capital structure or credit
ratings.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control would constitute a default
under the Credit Agreement and would constitute a Change of Control under the Senior Notes.
Future Senior Indebtedness of the Company may contain prohibitions on certain events which would
constitute a Change of Control or require such Senior Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a
Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Company to
repurchase the senior subordinated notes could cause a default under such Senior Indebtedness,
even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the
Company. Finally, the Company’s ability to pay cash to the holders upon a repurchase may be limited
by the Company’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds
will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of ‘‘all or
substantially all’’ the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is

179

a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of senior
subordinated notes to require the Company to repurchase such senior subordinated notes as a result
of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

#### Certain covenants

The senior subordinated indentures contain covenants including, among others, the following:

_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock._
The senior subordinated indentures provide that:

(1) the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly
or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue any
shares of Disqualified Stock; and

(2) the Company will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of
Preferred Stock;

_provided, however, that the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor may Incur_
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock and any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor may issue shares of Preferred Stock, in each case if the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for
which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such
additional Indebtedness is Incurred or such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would
have been at least 2.00 to 1.00 determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of
the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been Incurred, or the Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of proceeds
therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

The foregoing limitations will not apply to:

(a) the Incurrence by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness
under the Credit Agreement and the issuance and creation of letters of credit
and bankers’ acceptances thereunder (with letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances being deemed to have a principal amount equal to the face
amount thereof) up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion outstanding
at any one time;

(b) the Incurrence by the Company and the Guarantors of Indebtedness
represented by (1) the senior subordinated notes (not including any additional
senior subordinated notes) and the Senior Subordinated Guarantees, as
applicable, and (2) the Senior Notes and the related guarantees, as applicable;

(c) Indebtedness existing on the Acquisition Date (other than Indebtedness
described in clauses (a) and (b));

(d) Indebtedness (including Capitalized Lease Obligations) Incurred by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to finance the purchase, lease or
improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment (whether through the
direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such
assets (but no other material assets)) in an aggregate principal amount which,
when aggregated with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness then
outstanding and Incurred pursuant to this clause (d), does not exceed 5% of
Total Assets at the time of Incurrence;

(e) Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
constituting reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit issued in
the ordinary course of business, including without limitation letters of credit in

180


-----

respect of workers’ compensation claims, health, disability or other employee
benefits or property, casualty or liability insurance or self-insurance, or other
Indebtedness with respect to reimbursement type obligations regarding workers’
compensation claims; provided, however, that upon the drawing of such letters
of credit, such obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following such
drawing;

(f) Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary providing for indemnification, adjustment of purchase price or similar
obligations, in each case, Incurred in connection with the disposition of any
business, assets or a Subsidiary of the Company in accordance with the terms
of the senior subordinated indentures, other than guarantees of Indebtedness
Incurred by any Person acquiring all or any portion of such business, assets or
Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition;

(g) Indebtedness of the Company to a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that any
such Indebtedness is subordinated in right of payment to the senior
subordinated notes; provided further that any subsequent issuance or transfer
of any Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such Restricted
Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or any other
subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness (except to the Company or
another Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case to be an
Incurrence of such Indebtedness;

(h) shares of Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary issued to the Company or
another Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; provided that any subsequent
issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event which results in
any Restricted Subsidiary that holds such shares of Preferred Stock of another
Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary, or any other
subsequent transfer of any such shares of Preferred Stock (except to the
Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to
be an issuance of shares of Preferred Stock;

(i) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted
Subsidiary; provided that (i) any such Indebtedness is made pursuant to an
intercompany note and (ii) if a Guarantor incurs such Indebtedness to a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor such Indebtedness is subordinated
in right of payment to the Senior Subordinated Guarantee of such Guarantor;
_provided further that any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock_
or any other event which results in any Restricted Subsidiary lending such
Indebtedness ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent
transfer of any such Indebtedness (except to the Company or another
Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to be an Incurrence of
such Indebtedness;

(j) Hedging Obligations that are Incurred in the ordinary course of business (and
not for speculative purposes): (1) for the purpose of fixing or hedging interest
rate risk with respect to any Indebtedness that is permitted by the terms of the
senior subordinated indentures to be outstanding; (2) for the purpose of fixing or
hedging currency exchange rate risk with respect to any currency exchanges; or
(3) for the purpose of fixing or hedging commodity price risk with respect to any
commodity purchases;

(k) obligations in respect of performance, bid and surety bonds and completion
guarantees provided by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in the
ordinary course of business;

181


-----

(l) Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary not otherwise permitted hereunder in an aggregate principal amount,
which when aggregated with the principal amount or liquidation preference of all
other Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock then outstanding and Incurred
pursuant to this clause (l), does not exceed $250 million at any one time
outstanding (it being understood that any Indebtedness Incurred under this
clause (l) shall cease to be deemed Incurred or outstanding for purposes of this
clause (l) but shall be deemed Incurred for purposes of the first paragraph of
this covenant from and after the first date on which the Company, or the
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, could have Incurred such
Indebtedness under the first paragraph of this covenant without reliance upon
this clause (l));

(m) any guarantee by the Company or a Guarantor of Indebtedness or other
obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries so long as the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary is permitted under the terms of the senior subordinated indentures;
_provided that if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right_
of payment to the senior subordinated notes or the Senior Subordinated
Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, any such guarantee of
such Guarantor with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right
of payment to such Guarantor’s Senior Subordinated Guarantee with respect to
the senior subordinated notes substantially to the same extent as such
Indebtedness is subordinated to the senior subordinated notes or the Senior
Subordinated Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable;

(n) the Incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of
Indebtedness which serves to refund or refinance any Indebtedness Incurred as
permitted under the first paragraph of this covenant and clauses (b), (c), (d) and
(o) of this paragraph or any Indebtedness issued to so refund or refinance such
Indebtedness (subject to the following proviso, ‘‘Refinancing Indebtedness’’)
prior to its respective maturity; provided, however, that such Refinancing
Indebtedness:

(1) has a Weighted Average Life to Maturity at the time such Refinancing
Indebtedness is Incurred which is not less than the remaining Weighted
Average Life to Maturity of the Indebtedness being refunded or
refinanced;

(2) has a Stated Maturity which is no earlier than the Stated Maturity of the
Indebtedness being refunded or refinanced;

(3) to the extent such Refinancing Indebtedness refinances Indebtedness
pari passu with, or junior to, the senior subordinated notes or the Senior
Subordinated Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable,
such Refinancing Indebtedness is pari passu with, or junior to, the senior
subordinated notes or the Senior Subordinated Guarantee of such
Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable;

(4) is Incurred in an aggregate principal amount (or if issued with original
issue discount, an aggregate issue price) that is equal to or less than the
aggregate principal amount (or if issued with original issue discount, the
aggregate accreted value) then outstanding of the Indebtedness being
refinanced plus premium and fees Incurred in connection with such
refinancing; and

182


-----

(5) shall not include (x) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor that refinances Indebtedness of the Company, or (y)
Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary that refinances
Indebtedness of an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

_provided further that subclauses (1) and (2) of this clause (n) will not apply to_
any refunding or refinancing of any Senior Indebtedness; and provided further
that Indebtedness incurred to refinance, directly or indirectly, the Lucas Bonds,
shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this clause (n), provided that (A)
such Indebtedness has a Stated Maturity no earlier than February 15, 2013, in
the case of Indebtedness Incurred by the Company, and no earlier than August
15, 2013, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary,
(B) the principal amount of such Indebtedness does not exceed the then
outstanding principal amount of the Lucas Bonds, unless such excess could
otherwise be incurred under this ‘‘Limitation on the Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ covenant and (C) in
the event that such Indebtedness is issued upon the drawing of a Qualified
Letter of Credit, the proceeds of such drawing are either used to repay the
Lucas Bonds or are held in an escrow account pending such application;

(o) Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of Persons that are acquired by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or merged into a Restricted
Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the senior subordinated indentures;
_provided, however, that such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is not Incurred_
in contemplation of such acquisition or merger or to provide all or a portion of
the funds or credit support required to consummate such acquisition or merger;
_provided further, however, that after giving effect to such acquisition and the_
Incurrence of such Indebtedness either:

(1) the Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth
in the first sentence of this covenant; or

(2) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be greater than immediately
prior to such acquisition;

(p) Indebtedness Incurred by a Receivables Subsidiary in a Qualified Receivables
Financing that is not recourse to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of
the Company other than a Receivables Subsidiary (except for Standard
Securitization Undertakings);

(q) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of
a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the
ordinary course of business, provided that such Indebtedness is extinguished
within two Business Days of its Incurrence;

(r) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company
supported by a letter of credit issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement, in a
principal amount not in excess of the stated amount of such letter of credit;

(s) Contribution Indebtedness; and

(t) (a) if the Company could Incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the
first paragraph hereof after giving effect to such borrowing, Indebtedness of
Foreign Subsidiaries not otherwise permitted hereunder or (b) if the Company
could not Incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph
hereof after giving effect to such borrowing, Indebtedness of Foreign
Subsidiaries Incurred for working capital purposes, in either case in an
aggregate principal amount, which when aggregated with the principal amount

183


-----

of all other Indebtedness then outstanding and Incurred pursuant to this clause
(t), does not exceed the greater of (x) $400 million and (y) 10% of the
consolidated assets of the Foreign Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Guarantor may Incur any Indebtedness
pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph if the proceeds thereof are used, directly or
indirectly, to repay, prepay, redeem, defease, retire, refund or refinance any Subordinated
Indebtedness unless such Indebtedness will be subordinated to the senior subordinated notes or
such Guarantor’s Senior Subordinated Guarantee, as applicable, to at least the same extent as such
Subordinated Indebtedness. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event
that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted
Indebtedness described in clauses (a) through (t) above or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the
first paragraph of this covenant, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify such
item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this covenant and such item of Indebtedness
will be treated as having been Incurred pursuant to only one of such clauses or pursuant to the first
paragraph hereof. Accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value and the payment of interest in
the form of additional Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for
purposes of this covenant.

_Limitation on Restricted Payments. The senior subordinated indentures provide that the Company will_
not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on account of the Company’s or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests, including any payment made in
connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company (other than (A)
dividends or distributions by the Company payable solely in Equity Interests (other
than Disqualified Stock) of the Company; or (B) dividends or distributions by a
Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any dividend or distribution payable on
or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary
other than a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary, the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution in
accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities);

(2) purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of TRW
Automotive Holdings, TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings or the Company;

maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness (other than the payment, redemption,
repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement of (A) Subordinated Indebtedness in
anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity,
in each case due within one year of the date of such payment, redemption,
repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement and (B) Indebtedness permitted
under clauses (g) and (i) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock’’); or

(4) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively
referred to as ‘‘Restricted Payments’’), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment:

(a) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would
occur as a consequence thereof;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, the
Company could Incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness under the provisions of
the first paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance
of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock;’’ and

(4) (only to the extent of one-half of the amounts paid pursuant to such clause),
(6) and (8) of the next succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted
Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of,
without duplication:

(1) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Company for the period
(taken as one accounting period) from January 1, 2003 to the end of the

the case such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit,
minus 100% of such deficit); plus

(2) 100% of the aggregate net proceeds, including cash and the Fair Market
Value (as determined in accordance with the next succeeding sentence)

Preferred Stock, Excluded Contributions and Disqualified Stock),

Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, the Fair Market Value (as
determined in accordance with the next succeeding sentence) of the
Investment of the Company in such Unrestricted Subsidiary at the time of
such redesignation, combination or transfer (or of the assets transferred

185


-----

or conveyed, as applicable), after deducting any Indebtedness associated
with the Unrestricted Subsidiary so designated or combined or any
Indebtedness associated with the assets so transferred or conveyed.

The Fair Market Value of property other than cash covered by clauses (c)(2), (3), (4) and (5) above
shall be determined in good faith by the Company and

(A) in the event of property with a Fair Market Value in excess of $15
million, shall be set forth in an Officers’ Certificate or

Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ so long as

(a) the principal amount of such new Indebtedness does not exceed the principal
amount of the Subordinated Indebtedness being so redeemed, repurchased,

present or former employee, director or consultant of the Company, TRW Automotive

_provided, however, that at the time of, and after giving effect to, any Restricted Payment permitted_
under clauses (6), (7), (10) and (11), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, in no event shall any of the foregoing clauses (1) through (15) or any other Restricted
Payment permitted under this covenant be used or relied upon for purposes of (x) making any
payment in respect of, or otherwise servicing the obligations represented by, the Seller Note or (y)
making any payment to fund, or otherwise in respect of, an Accelerated Monitoring Fee Payment,
unless in the case of clause (y), prior to such payment either (i) a public Equity Offering by the

Company to purchase such holders’ notes in accordance with the covenant described under
‘‘—Change of Control’’ have been purchased prior to such payment being made.

As of the Acquisition Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries were Restricted Subsidiaries and are
currently Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to
become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the definition of ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary.’’ For
purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding
Investments by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the
Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount determined as set
forth in the last sentence of the definition of ‘‘Investments.’’ Such designation will only be permitted if
a Restricted Payment in such amount would be permitted at such time and if such Subsidiary
otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries. The senior subordinated indentures_
provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual
encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (1) on its Capital Stock; or (2) with respect to any other
interest or participation in, or by, its profits; or (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(b) make loans or advances to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;
or

the funds or credit support utilized to consummate such acquisition), which
encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets
of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so
acquired;

(5) any restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to an
agreement entered into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the Capital
Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary pending the closing of such sale or
disposition;

(6) Secured Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenants

amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the

restrictions than those contained in the dividend or other payment restrictions prior to
such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding,
replacement or refinancing.

_Asset Sales. The senior subordinated indentures provide that the Company will not, and will not_
permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, cause or make an Asset Sale, unless (x) the Company, or
its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale
at least equal to the Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Company) of the assets
sold or otherwise disposed of, and (y) at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by the
Company, or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalents;
_provided that the amount of:_

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most
recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto) of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the
senior subordinated notes) that are assumed by the transferee of any such
assets;

(b) any notes or other obligations or other securities or assets received by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted
by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days of the
receipt thereof (to the extent of the cash received); and

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market
Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration
received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of 2.5% of Total Assets or $100 million at the time of the
receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value
of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value)

shall be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for the purposes of this provision.

Within 365 days after the Company’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Proceeds of
any Asset Sale, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary may apply the Net Proceeds from such
Asset Sale, at its option:

(1) to permanently reduce Obligations under the Credit Agreement (and, in the case of
revolving Obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto) or
other Senior Indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, or Pari Passu Indebtedness
(provided that if the Company shall so reduce Obligations under Pari Passu
Indebtedness, it will equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the senior
subordinated notes by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth
below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase at a purchase price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
interest, if any, the pro rata principal amount of senior subordinated notes) or
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, in each case other
than Indebtedness owed to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company;

(2) to an investment in any one or more businesses (provided that such investment in any
business may be in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock so long as it results in
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, owning substantially all
the Capital Stock of such business), or capital expenditures, in each case used or
useful in a Similar Business; and/or

(3) to make an investment in any one or more businesses (provided that such investment
in any business may be in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock so long as it
results in the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, owning
substantially all the Capital Stock of such business), properties or assets that replace
the properties and assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale.

191


-----

Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
may temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise invest such
Net Proceeds in Cash Equivalents or Investment Grade Securities. The senior subordinated
indentures will provide that any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale that are not applied as provided
and within the time period set forth in the first sentence of this paragraph (it being understood that
any portion of such Net Proceeds used to make an offer to purchase senior subordinated notes, as
described in clause (1) above, shall be deemed to have been invested whether or not such offer is
accepted) will be deemed to constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds.’’ When the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds exceeds $20.0 million, the Company shall make an offer to all holders of senior
subordinated notes (an ‘‘Asset Sale Offer’’) to purchase the maximum principal amount of senior
subordinated notes, that is an integral multiple of $1,000 or t1,000, as applicable, that may be
purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the date
fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the senior
subordinated indentures. The Company will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess
Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceeds $20.0 million by
mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the senior subordinated indentures, with a copy
to the Trustee. To the extent that the aggregate amount of senior subordinated notes tendered
pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any
remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes. If the aggregate principal amount of
senior subordinated notes surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds,
the Trustee shall select the senior subordinated notes to be purchased in the manner described
below. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset
at zero.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the senior subordinated notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
senior subordinated indentures, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the senior
subordinated indentures by virtue thereof.

If more senior subordinated notes are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer than the Company is
required to purchase, selection of such senior subordinated notes for purchase will be made by the
Trustee in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on
which such senior subordinated notes are listed, or if such senior subordinated notes are not so
listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and
appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements); provided that no
senior subordinated notes of $1,000 or less or t1,000 or less, as applicable, shall be purchased in
part.

Notices of an Asset Sale Offer shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 but not
more than 60 days before the purchase date to each holder of senior subordinated notes at such
holder’s registered address. If any senior subordinated note is to be purchased in part only, any
notice of purchase that relates to such senior subordinated note shall state the portion of the
principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased.

A new senior subordinated note in principal amount equal to the unpurchased portion of any senior
subordinated note purchased in part will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original senior subordinated note. On and after the purchase date, unless the
Company defaults in payment of the purchase price, interest shall cease to accrue on senior
subordinated notes or portions thereof purchased.

_Transactions with Affiliates. The senior subordinated indentures provide that the Company will not,_
and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or
sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any

192


-----

property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction or series of transactions,
contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any
Affiliate of the Company (each of the foregoing, an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate
consideration in excess of $15 million, unless:

(a) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to
the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have
been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions
involving aggregate consideration in excess of $30 million, the Company
delivers to the Trustee a resolution adopted in good faith by the majority of the
Board of Directors of the Company, approving such Affiliate Transaction and set
forth in an Officers’ Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies
with clause (a) above.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(1) transactions between or among the Company and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) Restricted Payments permitted by the provisions of the senior subordinated indentures
described above under the covenant ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments;’’

(3) the payment of annual management, consulting, monitoring and advisory fees and
expenses to Blackstone and its Affiliates in an amount in any fiscal year not to exceed
$7.5 million, or the payment of, or in respect of, an Accelerated Monitoring Fee
Payment in accordance with the covenant ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments;’’

(4) the payment of reasonable and customary fees paid to, and indemnity provided on
behalf of, officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Company, TRW
Automotive Holdings, TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(5) payments by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to Blackstone made
for any financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect
of other investment banking activities, including, without limitation, in connection with
acquisitions or divestitures, which payments are approved by a majority of the Board
of Directors of the Company in good faith;

(6) transactions in which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating
that such transaction is fair to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a
financial point of view or meets the requirements of clause (a) of the preceding
paragraph;

(7) payments or loans to employees or consultants in the ordinary course of business
which are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company in good
faith;

(8) any agreement (other than with Blackstone or its Affiliates) as in effect as of the
Acquisition Date or any amendment thereto (so long as any such amendment is not
disadvantageous to the holders of the senior subordinated notes in any material
respect) or any transaction contemplated thereby;

(9) the existence of, or the performance by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries of its obligations under the terms of, Acquisition Documents, any
stockholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or purchase
agreement related thereto) to which it is a party as of the Acquisition Date and any
amendment thereto or similar agreements which it may enter into thereafter; provided,

193


-----

_however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Company or any of its_
Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations under any future amendment to any such
existing agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Acquisition
Date shall only be permitted by this clause (9) to the extent that the terms of any such
amendment or new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous to the holders of
the senior subordinated notes in any material respect;

(10) the payment of all fees and expenses related to the Transactions, including fees to
Blackstone, which are described in this listing memorandum;

(11) (a) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or
services, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance
with the terms of the senior subordinated indentures, which are fair to the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the reasonable determination of the Board of
Directors or the senior management of the Company, and are on terms at least as
favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated
party or (b) transactions with Unrestricted Subsidiaries and joint ventures for the
purchase or sale of automotive goods, products, parts and services entered into in the
ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent with past practice;

(12) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing; and

(13) the issuance of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company, TRW
Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings to any Permitted
Holder.

_Liens. The senior subordinated indentures provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any_
of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien on any
asset or property of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, or any income or profits therefrom,
or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, that secures any obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Senior Indebtedness) unless the senior subordinated
notes are equally and ratably secured with (or on a senior basis to, in the case of obligations
subordinated in right of payment to the senior subordinated notes) the obligations so secured or until
such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien. The preceding sentence will not
require the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to secure the senior subordinated notes if the Lien
consists of a Permitted Lien.

The senior subordinated indentures provide that no Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor will
directly or indirectly create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien on any asset or property of such
Guarantor or any income or profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income
therefrom, that secures any obligation of such Guarantor (other than Senior Indebtedness of such
Guarantor) unless the Senior Subordinated Guarantee of such Guarantor is equally and ratably
secured with (or on a senior basis to, in the case of obligations subordinated on right of payment to
such Guarantor’s Senior Subordinated Guarantee) the obligations so secured or until such time as
such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien. The preceding sentence will not require any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to secure its Senior Subordinated Guarantee if the Lien
consists of a Permitted Lien.

_Limitation on other senior subordinated indebtedness. The senior subordinated indentures provide_
that the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to,
directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness of the Company or any Indebtedness of any such
Grantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is either:

(1) pari passu in right of payment with the senior subordinated notes or such Guarantor’s
Senior Subordinated Guarantee, as the case may be, or

(2) subordinate in right of payment to the senior subordinated notes or such Guarantor’s
Senior Subordinated Guarantee, as the case may be.

194


-----

_Reports and other information. The senior subordinated indentures provide that notwithstanding that_
the Company may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such
annual and quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the
Company will, beginning August 15, 2003, file with the SEC (and provide the Trustee and holders
with copies thereof, without cost to each holder, within 15 days after it files them with the SEC),

(1) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year (or such shorter period as may be
required by the SEC), annual reports on Form 10-K (or any successor or comparable
form) containing the information required to be contained therein (or required in such
successor or comparable form);

(2) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year
(or such shorter period as may be required by the SEC), reports on Form 10-Q (or any
successor or comparable form);

(3) promptly from time to time after the occurrence of an event required to be therein
reported (and in any event within the time period specified for filing current reports on
Form 8-K by the SEC), such other reports on Form 8-K (or any successor or
comparable form); and

(4) any other information, documents and other reports which the Company would be
required to file with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act;

_provided, however, the Company shall not be so obligated to file such reports with the SEC if the_
SEC does not permit such filing, in which event the Company will make available such information to
prospective purchasers of senior subordinated notes, in addition to providing such information to the
Trustees and the holders, in each case within 15 days after the time the Company would be required
to file such information with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, such requirements shall be deemed satisfied prior to the
commencement of the Exchange Offer (as defined) or the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration
Statement (as defined) by the filing with the SEC of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as
defined) and/or Shelf Registration Statement, and any amendments thereto, with such financial
information that satisfies Regulation S-X of the Securities Act. In the event that:

(a) the rules and regulations of the SEC permit the Company and TRW Automotive
Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings to report at the TRW
Automotive Holdings’ or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings’ level on a
consolidated basis and

(b) TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings’, as
applicable, is not engaged in any business in any material respect other than
incidental to its ownership, directly or indirectly, of the capital stock of the
Company,

such consolidated reporting at the TRW Automotive Holdings’ or TRW Automotive Intermediate
Holdings’ level, as applicable, in a manner consistent with that described in this covenant for the
Company will satisfy this covenant.

_Future guarantors. The senior subordinated indentures will provide that the Company will cause each_
Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary that is a Domestic Subsidiary (unless such Subsidiary is a
Receivables Subsidiary) that:

(a) guarantees any Indebtedness of TRW Automotive Holdings, the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(b) Incurs any Indebtedness or issues any shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock permitted to be Incurred or issued pursuant to the first paragraph of the

195


-----

covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ or clauses (a), (l) or (s) of
the second paragraph thereof or not permitted to be Incurred by such covenant:

to execute and deliver to the Trustee supplemental indentures pursuant to which such Subsidiary will
guarantee payment of the senior subordinated notes. In addition, the senior subordinated indentures
will provide that the Company will cause each non-wholly owned Domestic Subsidiary that is a
Significant Subsidiary that guarantees any Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement to execute and
deliver to the Trustee supplemental indentures pursuant to which such Subsidiary will guarantee
payment of the senior subordinated notes. Each Senior Subordinated Guarantee will be limited to an
amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by that Restricted Subsidiary
without rendering the Senior Subordinated Guarantee, as it relates to such Restricted Subsidiary,
voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally.

The indentures will also provide that if TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate
Holdings is engaged in any business in any material respect other than incidental to its ownership,
directly or indirectly, of the capital stock of the Company or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings,
as applicable, or acquires any assets that are material, other than capital stock of the Company or
TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings, as applicable, TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive
Intermediate Holdings, as applicable, will execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture pursuant to which TRW Automotive Holdings or TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings, as
applicable, will guarantee payment of the senior subordinated notes.

#### Merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets

The senior subordinated indentures provide that the Company may not consolidate or merge with or
into or wind up into (whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign,
transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one
or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) the Company is the surviving corporation or the Person formed by or surviving any
such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a
corporation, partnership or limited liability company organized or existing under the
laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory
thereof (the Company or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the
‘‘Successor Company’’);

(2) the Successor Company (if other than the Company) expressly assumes all the
obligations of the Company under the senior subordinated indentures and the senior
subordinated notes pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or
instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness
which becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction) no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, as if such transaction
had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, either

(a) the Successor Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the
first sentence of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ or

196


-----

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Successor Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries would be greater than such ratio for the Company and
its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction;

(5) each Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, shall
have by supplemental indentures confirmed that its Senior Subordinated Guarantee
shall apply to such Person’s obligations under the senior subordinated indentures and
the senior subordinated notes; and

(6) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indentures (if any) comply with the senior subordinated indentures.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Company under the senior
subordinated indentures and the senior subordinated notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses
(3) and (4), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to the Company or to another Restricted Subsidiary, and (b) the Company may
merge with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Company in another
state of the United States so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries is not increased thereby.

The senior subordinated indentures further provide that subject to certain limitations in the senior
subordinated indentures governing release of a Senior Subordinated Guarantee upon the sale or
disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor, each such Guarantor will not, and the
Company will not permit such a Guarantor to, consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into
(whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey
or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related
transactions to, any Person unless:

(1) such Guarantor is the surviving corporation or the Person formed by or surviving any
such consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a
corporation, partnership or limited liability company organized or existing under the
laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory
thereof (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the
‘‘Successor Guarantor’’);

(2) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor) expressly assumes all the
obligations of such Guarantor under the senior subordinated indentures and such
Guarantors’s Senior Subordinated Guarantee pursuant to supplemental indentures or
other documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness
which becomes an obligation of the Successor Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries as
a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Guarantor or
such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction) no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing; and

(4) such Guarantor shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to the Trustee an
Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation,
merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures (if any) comply with the senior
subordinated indentures.

The senior subordinated indentures also contain similar provisions governing the release of the
Senior Subordinated Guarantees, if any, by TRW Automotive Holdings and TRW Automotive
Intermediate Holdings. Subject to certain limitations described in the senior subordinated indentures,
the Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Guarantor under the senior
subordinated indentures and such Guarantor’s Senior Subordinated Guarantee. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Guarantor may merge with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of

197


-----

reincorporating such Guarantor in another state of the United States so long as the amount of
Indebtedness of the Guarantor is not increased thereby.

#### Defaults

An Event of Default is defined in the senior subordinated indentures as:

(1) a default in any payment of interest on any senior subordinated note when due,
whether or not prohibited by the provisions described under ‘‘—Ranking’’ above,
continued for 30 days;

(2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of any senior subordinated
note when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required
repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise, whether or not such payment is prohibited
by the provisions described under ‘‘—Ranking’’ above;

(3) the failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under the covenant
described under ‘‘—Merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets’’
above;

(4) the failure by the Company to comply for 30 days after notice with any of its
obligations under the covenants described under ‘‘—Change of Control’’ or ‘‘—Certain
covenants’’ above (in each case, other than a failure to purchase senior subordinated
notes);

(5) the failure by the Company to comply for 60 days after notice with its other
agreements contained in the senior subordinated notes or the senior subordinated
indentures;

(6) the failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary to pay any Indebtedness
(other than Indebtedness owing to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within any
applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such
Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default if the total amount of such
Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50.0 million or its foreign currency
equivalent (the ‘‘cross acceleration provision’’); provided, however, that no Event of
Default shall be deemed to arise under the senior subordinated indentures with
respect to the acceleration of the Lucas Bonds so long as not later than two Business
Days after the date of any such acceleration and at all times thereafter until the Lucas
Bonds have been repaid in full or such acceleration has been withdrawn, revoked or
annulled, a Qualified Letter of Credit has been issued and remains in effect;

(7) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a
Significant Subsidiary (the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’);

(8) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments
aggregating in excess of $50.0 million (net of any amounts which are covered by
enforceable insurance policies issued by solvent carriers), which judgments are not
discharged, waived or stayed for a period of 60 days (the ‘‘judgment default
provision’’); or

(9) any Senior Subordinated Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full
force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Guarantor
denies or disaffirms its obligations under the senior subordinated indentures or any
Senior Subordinated Guarantee and such Default continues for 10 days.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and
whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment,
decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental
body.

198


-----

However, a default under clause (4) or (5) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or
the holders of 25% in principal amount of either issue of senior subordinated notes notify the
Company of the default and the Company does not cure such default within the time specified in
clauses (4) and (5) hereof after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than a Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization of the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25%
in principal amount of either issue of senior subordinated notes by notice to the Company may
declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the senior
subordinated notes of such issue to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal
and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of
bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs, the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on all the senior subordinated notes will become immediately due and payable without
any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances,
the holders of a majority in principal amount of either issue of senior subordinated notes may rescind
any such acceleration with respect to such senior subordinated notes and its consequences.

Subject to the provisions of the senior subordinated indentures relating to the duties of the Trustee, in
case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise
any of the rights or powers under the senior subordinated indentures at the request or direction of
any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security
against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal,
premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the senior
subordinated indentures or the senior subordinated notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the senior subordinated notes of the
applicable issue have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any
loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the
request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the senior subordinated notes of such
issue have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such
60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of either issue of senior
subordinated notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on
the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the
senior subordinated indentures or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of
any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under
the senior subordinated indentures, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in
its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The senior subordinated indentures provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually
known to the Trustee, the Trustee must mail to each holder of dollar senior subordinated notes or
euro senior subordinated notes, as applicable, notice of the Default within the earlier of 90 days after
it occurs or 30 days after it is actually known to a Trust Officer or written notice of it is received by
the Trustee. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or
interest on any senior subordinated note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a
committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of
the noteholders. In addition, the Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after
the end of each fiscal year, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default

199


-----

that occurred during the previous year. The Company also is required to deliver to the Trustee, within
30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event which would constitute certain
Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

#### Amendments and waivers

Subject to certain exceptions, the senior subordinated indentures may be amended with the consent
of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the dollar senior subordinated notes or the euro
senior subordinated notes, as applicable, then outstanding and any past default or compliance with
any provisions may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
dollar senior subordinated notes or the euro senior subordinated notes, as applicable, then
outstanding. However, without the consent of each holder of an senior subordinated note affected, no
amendment may, among other things:

(1) reduce the amount of senior subordinated notes whose holders must consent to an
amendment;

(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any senior
subordinated note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any senior subordinated note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any senior subordinated note or
change the time at which any senior subordinated note may be redeemed as
described under ‘‘Optional redemption’’ above;

(5) make any senior subordinated note payable in money other than that stated in such
senior subordinated note;

(6) make any change to the subordinated provisions of the senior subordinated indentures
that adversely affects the rights of any holder;

(7) impair the right of any holder to receive payment of principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on such holder’s senior subordinated notes on or after the due dates therefor
or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such
holder’s senior subordinated notes;

(8) make any change in the amendment provisions which require each holder’s consent
or in the waiver provisions; or

(9) modify the Senior Subordinated Guarantees in any manner adverse to the holders.

Without the consent of any holder, the Company and Trustee may amend the senior subordinated
indentures to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, to provide for the assumption by
a successor corporation, partnership or limited liability company of the obligations of the Company
under the senior subordinated indentures, to provide for uncertificated senior subordinated notes in
addition to or in place of certificated senior subordinated notes (provided that the uncertificated senior
subordinated notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a
manner such that the uncertificated senior subordinated notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B)
of the Code), to add Senior Subordinated Guarantees with respect to the senior subordinated notes,
to secure the senior subordinated notes, to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of
the holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company, to make any change
that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder, to comply with any requirement of the SEC in
connection with the qualification of the senior subordinated indentures under the TIA or to make
certain changes to the senior subordinated indentures to provide for the issuance of additional senior
subordinated notes. However, no amendment may be made to the subordinated provisions of the
senior subordinated indentures that adversely affects the rights of any holder of Senior Indebtedness
then outstanding unless the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (or any group or representative
thereof authorized to give a consent) consent to such change.

200


-----

The consent of the noteholders is not necessary under the senior subordinated indentures to approve
the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment.

After an amendment under the senior subordinated indentures becomes effective, the Company is
required to mail to the respective noteholders a notice briefly describing such amendment. However,
the failure to give such notice to all noteholders entitled to receive such notice, or any defect therein,
will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment.

#### Transfer and exchange

A noteholder may transfer or senior subordinated notes in accordance with the senior subordinated
indentures. Upon any transfer or exchange, the registrar and the Trustee may require a noteholder,
among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Company
may require a noteholder to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the senior subordinated
indentures. The Company is not required to transfer or exchange any senior subordinated note
selected for redemption or to transfer or exchange any senior subordinated note for a period of 15
days prior to a selection of senior subordinated notes to be redeemed. The senior subordinated notes
will be issued in registered form and the registered holder of a senior subordinated note will be
treated as the owner of such senior subordinated note for all purposes.

#### Defeasance

The Company at any time may terminate all its obligations under the senior subordinated notes and
the senior subordinated indentures (‘‘legal defeasance’’), except for certain obligations, including
those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the
senior subordinated notes, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen senior subordinated notes
and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the senior subordinated notes. The
Company at any time may terminate its obligations under the provisions described under ‘‘___
Change of Control,’’ under the covenants described under ‘‘Certain covenants,’’ the operation of the
cross acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to Subsidiaries and the judgment
default provision described under ‘‘—Defaults’’ above and the limitations contained under ‘‘Merger,
consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets’’ above (‘‘covenant defeasance’’). If the
Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Guarantor
will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Senior Subordinated Guarantee.

The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its
covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
senior subordinated notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect
thereto. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the senior
subordinated notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3),
(4), (6), (7) with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries, (8) with respect only to Significant
Subsidiaries or (9) under ‘‘—Defaults’’ above or because of the failure of the Company to comply with
‘‘—Merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets’’ above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
‘‘defeasance trust’’) with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of
principal, premium (if any) and interest on the applicable issue of senior subordinated notes to
redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including
delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that holders of the senior subordinated
notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such
deposit and defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance
had not occurred (and, in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based
on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable Federal income tax law).

benefit plan or agreement) of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock and

‘‘Fair Market Value’’ means, with respect to any asset or property, the price which could be

‘‘Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio’’ means, with respect to any Person for any period, the ratio of
EBITDA of such Person for such period to the Fixed Charges of such Person for such period. In the
event that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurs or redeems any Indebtedness
(other than in the case of revolving credit borrowings or revolving advances under any Qualified
Receivables Financing, in which case interest expense shall be computed based upon the average
daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period) or issues or redeems Preferred
Stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is
being calculated but prior to the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
is made (the ‘‘Calculation Date’’), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving
pro forma effect to such Incurrence or redemption of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption
of Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter
period.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, consolidations and discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP), in
each case with respect to an operating unit of a business, that have been made by the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such
reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Calculation Date shall be calculated on
a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, discontinued
operations, mergers and consolidations (and the change of any associated fixed charge obligations
and the change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter
reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary since the
beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, discontinued
operation, merger or consolidation, in each case with respect to an operating unit of a business, that
would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition,
disposition, discontinued operation, merger or consolidation had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any transaction, the pro
forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the
Company. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect,
the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date

209


-----

had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations
applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term in excess of 12
months). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate
reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company to be the rate
of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of
making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit
facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of
such Indebtedness during the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be
determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency
interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually
chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company may designate. Any
such pro forma calculation may include adjustments appropriate, in the reasonable determination of
the Company as set forth in an Officers’ Certificate, to reflect operating expense reductions
reasonably expected to result from any acquisition or merger.

‘‘Fixed Charges’’ means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum of:

subordinated indentures, the term ‘‘consolidated’’ with respect to any Person shall mean such Person

the interest of such Person in an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be accounted for as an Investment.

include a depository receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act), as

## Registration rights

We and the guarantors have entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to each of the
dollar senior notes, the euro senior notes, the dollar senior subordinated notes and the euro senior
subordinated notes with the initial purchasers on the closing date. In those agreements, we have
agreed for the benefit of the holders of the notes that we will use our reasonable best efforts to file
with the SEC and cause to become effective a registration statement relating to an offer to exchange
each issue of notes for an issue of SEC-registered notes with terms identical to the notes being
exchanged (except that the notes will not be subject to restrictions on transfer or to any increase in
annual interest rate as described below).

We have filed an exchange offer registration statement with the SEC on July 1, 2003. When the SEC
declares the exchange offer registration statement effective, we will offer the exchange notes in
return for the notes. Each exchange offer will remain open for at least 20 business days after the
date we mail notice of the exchange offer to noteholders. For each note surrendered to us under the
exchange offers, the noteholder will receive an exchange note of equal principal amount. Interest on
each exchange note will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on
the notes or, if no interest has been paid on the notes, from the closing date.

If applicable interpretations of the staff of the SEC do not permit us to effect the exchange offers, we
will use our reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a shelf registration statement
relating to resales of the notes and to keep that shelf registration statement effective until the
expiration of the time period referred to in Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act, or such shorter
period that will terminate when all notes covered by the shelf registration statement have been sold.
We will, in the event of such a shelf registration, provide to each noteholder copies of a prospectus,
notify each noteholder when the shelf registration statement has become effective and take certain
other actions to permit resales of the notes. A noteholder that sells notes under the shelf registration
statement generally will be required to be named as a selling security holder in the related
prospectus and to deliver a prospectus to purchasers, will be subject to certain of the civil liability
provisions under the Securities Act in connection with those sales and will be bound by the
provisions of the registration rights agreement that are applicable to such a noteholder (including
certain indemnification obligations).

If the exchange offers are not completed (or, if required, the shelf registration statement is not
declared effective) on or before the date that is 290 days after the closing date, the annual interest
rate borne by the notes will be increased by 0.25% per annum (which rate will be increased by an
additional 0.25% per annum for each subsequent 90 day period that such additional interest
continues to accrue, provided that the rate at which such additional interest accrues may in no event
exceed 1% per annum) until the exchange offers are completed or the shelf registration statement is
declared effective.

If we effect the exchange offers, we will be entitled to close each exchange offer 20 business days
after its commencement, provided that we have accepted all notes validly surrendered in accordance
with the terms of the applicable exchange offer. Notes not tendered in the exchange offers shall bear
interest at the rate set forth on the cover page of this listing memorandum and be subject to all the
terms and conditions specified in the applicable indenture, including transfer restrictions.

In the event of registered exchange offers, (a) notice will be given to the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and published in a Luxembourg newspaper announcing the beginning of the registered
exchange offers and, following completion of the offers, the results of the offers, (b) a Luxembourg
exchange agent, through which all relevant documents with respect to the registered exchange offers
will be made available, will be appointed and (c) the Luxembourg exchange agent will be able to
perform all agency functions to be performed by any exchange agent, including providing a letter of
transmittal and other relevant documents to holders, and accepting such documents on behalf of us.
The dollar notes will be accepted for clearance through DTC and notice will be given to the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and published in a Luxembourg newspaper announcing the relevant
International Securities Identification Numbers. Holders of dollar notes will be able to hold their notes
through Euroclear and Clearstream Banking, which are participants in DTC. The euro notes will be

223


-----

accepted for clearance through Euroclear and Clearstream Banking and notice will be given to the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and published in a Luxembourg newspaper announcing the relevant
International Securities Identification Numbers.

This summary of the provisions of each registration rights agreement does not purport to be
complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the
registration rights agreement, a copy of which is available from us upon request.

## Book-entry settlement and clearance

#### General
Each issue of notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the
Securities Act are represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached
(collectively, the ‘‘Rule 144A Global Notes’’). The Rule 144A Global Notes representing the dollar
notes (the ‘‘Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes’’) and the Rule 144A Global Notes representing the euro
notes (the ‘‘Euro Rule 144A Global Notes’’) have been deposited with the Trustee, as custodian for
The Depository Trust Company (‘‘DTC’’), and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of
DTC.

Each issue of notes sold to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act
are represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively,
the ‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’ and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the ‘‘Global Notes’’).
The Regulation S Global Notes representing the dollar notes (the ‘‘Dollar Regulation S Global
Notes’’) and the Regulation S Global Notes representing the euro notes (the ‘‘Euro Regulation S
Global Notes’’) have been registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC and deposited
with the Trustee as custodian for DTC, and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of
DTC.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (‘‘Restricted Book-Entry Interests’’) and in the
Regulations S Global Notes (the ‘‘Unrestricted Book-Entry Interests’’ and, together with the Restricted
Book-Entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) are limited to persons that have accounts with DTC
or persons that hold interests through such participants. Except under the limited circumstances
described below, owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes are not entitled to receive physical
delivery of certificated notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by DTC and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including
certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical
delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own,
transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the notes are in global form, holders of
Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or ‘‘holders’’ of notes for any purpose.

So long as the notes are held in global form, DTC, or its nominee, will be considered the sole holder
of Global Notes for all purposes under the indentures. In addition, participants must rely on the
procedures of DTC and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC and the participants
through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of
holders under the indentures.

Neither we nor the trustees under the indentures will have any responsibility or be liable for any
aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

#### Redemption of the Global Notes
In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC, or its nominee, will redeem
an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in
respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the
redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC in connection
with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under existing
practices of DTC if fewer than all of the notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC, will credit their
respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or
by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no
Book-Entry Interest of t1,000 or $1,000, as applicable, principal amount or less may be redeemed in
part.

#### Payments on Global Notes
We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) to DTC or its nominee, which will distribute such payments to

225


-----

participants in accordance with its procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without
deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature except as may be required by law. We expect that
standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to
owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the indentures, we and the trustees under the indentures will treat the registered
holder of the Global Notes (DTC or its nominee) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we nor the trustees or any of our or the
trustees’ respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

� any aspect of the records of DTC or any participant or indirect participant relating to payments
made on account of a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of DTC or any participant or indirect participant relating to payments made on account
of a Book-Entry Interest; or

� DTC or any participant or indirect participant.

#### Currency of payment for the Global Notes

Except as may otherwise be agreed between DTC and any holder, the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes and
the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such notes through DTC
in dollars, and the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in
respect of, the Euro Rule 144A Global Notes and the Euro Regulation S Global Notes will be paid to
holders of interests in such notes in euros. Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other
laws and regulations (including any regulations of the applicable securities clearing system)
applicable thereto. None of we, the trustees, the initial purchasers or any of our or their respective
agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs,
losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in
connection with any such payment.

#### Action by owners of book-entry interests

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including
the presentation of notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more
participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in
respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or
participants has or have given such direction. DTC will not exercise any discretion in the granting of
consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there
is an event of default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for
definitive registered notes in certificated form (‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’), and to distribute
definitive registered notes to its participants.

#### Transfers

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes are subject to the applicable rules and
procedures of DTC and its respective direct or indirect participants, which rules and procedures may
change from time to time.

The Global Notes bear a legend to the effect set forth in ‘‘Transfer restrictions.’’ Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes are subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements
discussed in ‘‘Transfer restrictions.’’

Book-Entry Interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes and only upon delivery
by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the relevant indenture) to the effect
that such transfer is made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

226


-----

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted
Book-Entry Interests are at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend
appearing on the face of the Rule 144A Global Notes, as set forth in ‘‘Transfer restrictions.’’

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of any
Unrestricted Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the relevant indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S or Rule 144A (if available under the Securities Act).

Transfers involving an exchange of an Unrestricted Book-Entry Interest for a Restricted Book-Entry
Interest or vice versa are effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the trustee
through the DTC Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian (DWAC) system. Accordingly, in connection with
any such transfer, appropriate adjustments are made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of
the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the
corresponding Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of
the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry
Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the
first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and
accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a
Book-Entry Interest.

#### Definitive Registered Notes

Under the terms of the indentures, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive
Registered Notes:

� if DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Note, or
DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case a
qualified successor depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days;

� if DTC so requests following an event of default under any of the indentures; or

� if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
either DTC or us following an event of default under any of the indentures.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note
may transfer such note by surrendering it to the registrar or a transfer agent. In the event of a partial
transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one
Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of
the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding
not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided,
that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than t1,000 or $1,000, as applicable, will
be issued. We will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivery of the Definitive
Registered Notes.

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a
period of 15 calendar days preceding (a) the record date for any payment of interest on the notes,
(b) any date fixed for redemption of the notes or (c) the date fixed for selection of the notes to be
redeemed in part. Also, we are not required to register the transfer or exchange of any notes
selected for redemption. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the trustee
under the applicable indenture may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents as described in the applicable indenture. We may require a
holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the indentures and the notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are
mutilated and are surrendered to the registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, we will issue and
the trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the trustee’s and our

227


-----

requirements are met. The trustee or we may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive
Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the trustee and us to
protect us, the trustee or the paying agent appointed pursuant to the relevant indenture from any loss
that may result if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We may charge for our expenses in
replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is
about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the
provisions of any of the indentures, we at our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive
Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only in accordance with the indentures and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to
the applicable trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the relevant indenture) to the
effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See
‘‘Transfer restrictions.’’

#### Information concerning DTC

**_DTC. DTC is:_**

� a limited purpose trust company organised under the New York Banking Law;

� a ‘‘banking organization’’ under New York Banking Law;

� a member of the Federal Reserve System;

� a ‘‘clearing corporation’’ within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

� a ‘‘clearing agency’’ registered under Section 17A of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement
of transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the
accounts of securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing
corporations and certain other organisations. DTC’s owners are the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.,
the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and a
number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that
clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant also have access to the
DTC system and are known as indirect participants.

Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants
and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons
or entities that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such
interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some states
require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial
interests through the DTC system will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes
only through DTC participants.

## Material United States federal income tax consequences

The following is a summary of material United States federal income tax consequences of the
ownership of notes as of the date hereof. Except where noted, this summary deals only with notes
that are held as capital assets and it does not deal with holders in special situations.

For example, this summary does not address tax consequences to holders who may be subject to
special tax treatment, such as dealers in securities or currencies, financial institutions, regulated
investment companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies,
persons holding our notes as a part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale
transaction or a straddle, traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of
accounting for their securities holdings, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, investors in
pass-through entities, or U.S. holders (as defined below) of our notes whose ‘‘functional currency’’ is
not the United States dollar. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the United
States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment
under the United States federal income tax laws (including if you are a United States expatriate,
‘‘controlled foreign corporation,’’ ‘‘passive foreign investment company,’’ ‘‘foreign personal holding
company’’ or an investor in a pass-through entity).

This summary is based upon provisions of the Code, and regulations, rulings and judicial decisions
as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in
United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below.

If a partnership holds our notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status
of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding our
notes, you should consult your tax advisors.

**You should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal**
**income tax consequences to you of the ownership of the notes, as well as the consequences**
**to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

#### Consequences to U.S. holders

The following is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences that will apply to you if
you are a U.S. holder of our notes. Certain consequences to ‘‘non-U.S. holders’’ of our notes, which
are beneficial owners of notes who are not U.S. holders, are described under ‘‘—Consequences to
non-U.S. holders’’ below.

A ‘‘U.S. holder’’ means a person that is for United States federal income tax purposes one of the
following:

   - a citizen or resident of the United States;

   - a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political
subdivision thereof;

   - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless
of its source; or

   - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and
one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of
the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury
regulations to be treated as a United States person.

**_Payments of interest_**

Except as set forth below, stated interest on a note is generally taxable to you as ordinary income at
the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for tax purposes.

232


-----

**_Market discount_**

If a U.S. holder purchases a note for an amount that is less than its stated redemption price at
maturity, the amount of the difference will be treated as ‘‘market discount’’ for United States federal
income tax purposes, unless such difference is less than a specified de minimis amount. Under the
market discount rules, a U.S. holder will be required to treat any principal payment on, or any gain on
the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of, a note as ordinary income to the extent of the
market discount which has not previously been included in income and is treated as having accrued
on such note at the time of such payment or disposition. In addition, the U.S. holder may be required
to defer, until the maturity of the note or its earlier disposition in a taxable transaction, the deduction
of all or a portion of the interest expense on any indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or
carry such note.

Any market discount will be considered to accrue ratably during the period from the date of
acquisition to the maturity date of the note, unless the U.S. holder elects to accrue on a constant
interest method. A U.S. holder of a note may elect to include market discount in income currently as
it accrues (on either a ratable or constant interest method), in which case the rule described above
regarding deferral of interest deductions will not apply. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors before making this election.

**_Amortizable bond premium_**

A U.S. holder that purchases a note for an amount in excess of the sum of all amounts payable on
the note after the purchase date other than qualified stated interest will be considered to have
purchased the note at a ‘‘premium.’’ A U.S. holder generally may elect to amortize the premium over
the remaining term of the note on a constant yield method as an offset to interest when includible in
income under the U.S. holder’s regular accounting method. Bond premium on a note held by a U.S.
holder that does not make such an election will decrease the gain or increase the loss otherwise
recognized on disposition of the note. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors before
making this election.

**_Sale, exchange and retirement of notes_**

Your tax basis in a note will, in general, be your cost therefor. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or
other disposition of a note, you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the
amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition (less an amount equal to
any accrued and unpaid interest which will be treated as a payment of interest for federal income tax
purposes) and the adjusted tax basis of your note. Except with respect to gain or loss attributable to
changes in exchange rates as described below with respect to euro notes, such gain or loss will be
capital gain or loss. Capital gains of individuals derived in respect of capital assets held for more
than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.

**_Euro notes_**

The following is a summary of material United States federal income tax consequences to you of the
ownership of a euro note.

_Payments of interest_

Cash basis U.S. holders are required to include in income the United States dollar value of the
amount of interest received, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless
of whether the payment is in fact converted into United States dollars. No exchange gain or loss is
recognized with respect to the receipt of such payment.

Accrual basis U.S. holders may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such
interest payment in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be
required to include in income for each taxable year the United States dollar value of the interest that

233


-----

has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of
exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued (or, with respect to an interest
accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average exchange rate for the partial period
within each taxable year). Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income at
the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period (or last day of the taxable year in the case of an
accrual period that straddles your taxable year) or on the date the interest payment is received if
such date is within five days of the end of the accrual period. If you make this election, you must
apply it consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and you cannot change it without the
consent of the Internal Revenue Service. Upon receipt of an interest payment on such note
(including, upon the sale of such note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to
accrued interest previously included in income), you will recognize exchange gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference between the United States dollar value of such payment (determined
by translating any euros received at the ‘‘spot rate’’ for euros on the date received) and the United
States dollar value of the interest income that you have previously included in income with respect to
such payment. In general, exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss for United
States federal income tax purposes.

_Market discount_

The amount of market discount on euro notes includible in income will generally be determined by
translating the market discount determined in euro into United States dollars at the spot rate on the
date the euro note is retired or otherwise disposed of. If the U.S. holder has elected to accrue market
discount currently, then the amount which accrues is determined in euro and then translated into
United States dollars on the basis of the average exchange rate in effect during such accrual period.
A U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to market discount which is accrued
currently using the approach applicable to the accrual of interest income as described above.

_Amortizable bond premium_

Bond premium on a euro note will be computed in euro. With respect to a U.S. holder that elects to
amortize the premium, the amortizable bond premium will reduce interest income in euro. At the time
bond premium is amortized, exchange gain or loss (which is generally ordinary income or loss) will
be realized based on the difference between spot rates at such time and at the time of acquisition of
the euro note. A U.S. holder that does not elect to amortize bond premium will translate the bond
premium, computed in euro, into United States dollars at the spot rate on the maturity date and such
bond premium will constitute a capital loss which may be offset or eliminated by exchange gain.

_Sale, exchange and retirement_

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a euro note, you will recognize
gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement
or other disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid interest, which will be treated
as a payment of interest for federal income tax purposes) and your adjusted tax basis in the euro
note. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, such gain or loss will be capital gain or
loss. Capital gains of individuals derived with respect to capital assets held for more than one year
are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

If your euro note is sold, exchanged or retired for an amount denominated in euros, then your
amount realized generally will be based on the spot rate of euros on the date of sale, exchange or
retirement. If the euro notes are traded on an established securities market by a cash method
taxpayer, the value of euros paid or received is translated into United States dollars at the spot rate
on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. An accrual method taxpayer may elect the same
treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of euro notes traded on an established securities
market, provided that the election is applied consistently.

Your tax basis in a euro note generally will be your cost therefor. If you purchased a euro note with
euros, your cost will be the United States dollar value of the euro amount paid for such euro note

234


-----

determined at the time of such purchase. If you purchased a euro note with previously owned euros,
you will recognize ordinary exchange gain or loss at the time of purchase attributable to the
difference at the time of purchase, if any, between your tax basis in such euros and the fair market
value of the euro note in United States dollars on the date of purchase. If the euro notes are traded
on an established securities market by a cash method taxpayer, euros paid or received are translated
into United States dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. An accrual
method taxpayer may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of euro notes
traded on an established securities market.

Upon the sale, exchange or retirement of a euro note, you will recognize exchange gain or loss with
respect to the principal amount of such euro note. For these purposes, the principal amount of the
euro note is your purchase price for the euro note calculated in euros on the date of purchase, and
the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the United
States dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement
or other disposition of the euro note and (ii) the United States dollar value of the principal amount
determined on the date you purchased the euro note. Such gain or loss will be treated as ordinary
income or loss and generally will be United States source gain or loss. The realization of such gain
or loss will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of a euro note.

_Exchange gain or loss with respect to euros_

Your tax basis in the euros received as interest on a euro note will be the United States dollar value
thereof at the spot rate in effect on the date the euros are received. Your tax basis in euros received
on the sale, exchange or retirement of a euro note will be equal to the United States dollar value of
the euros, determined at the time of the sale, exchange or retirement, or, if the euro notes are traded
on an established securities market, the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date, in the case of
a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder as described above.

Any gain or loss recognized by you on a sale, exchange or other disposition of the euros will be
ordinary income or loss and generally will be United States source gain or loss.

#### Consequences to non-U.S. holders

**_United States federal withholding tax_**

The 30% United States federal withholding tax will not apply to any payment of principal or interest
on a note, under the ‘‘portfolio interest rule,’’ provided that:

   - interest paid on the note is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or
business in the United States;

   - you do not actually (or constructively) own 10% or more of the total combined voting power
of all classes of our voting stock within the meaning of the Code and applicable United
States Treasury regulations;

   - you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us through stock ownership;

   - you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in section
881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; and

   - either (a) you provide your name and address on an Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) Form
W-8BEN (or other applicable form), and certify, under penalties of perjury, that you are not a
United States person or (b) you hold your notes through certain foreign intermediaries and
satisfy the certification requirements of applicable United States Treasury regulations.
Special certification and other rules apply to certain non-U.S. Holders that are entities rather
than individuals.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be
subject to the 30% United States federal withholding tax, unless you provide us with a properly
executed (1) IRS Form W-8BEN (or other applicable form) claiming an exemption from or reduction

235


-----

in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty or (2) IRS Form W-8ECI (or other
applicable form) stating that interest paid on a note is not subject to withholding tax because it is
effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (as discussed
below under ‘‘United States federal income tax’’).

The 30% United States federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any gain that you realize on
the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note.

**_United States federal income tax_**

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the notes is effectively
connected with the conduct of that trade or business, you will be subject to United States federal
income tax on that interest on a net income basis (although exempt from the 30% withholding tax,
provided certain certification and disclosure requirements discussed above in ‘‘United States federal
withholding tax’’ are satisfied) in the same manner as if you were a United States person as defined
under the Code. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits
tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of such amount, subject to adjustments.

Any gain realized on the disposition of a note generally will not be subject to United States federal
income tax unless:

   - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States, or

   - you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable
year of that disposition, and certain other conditions are met.

**_United States federal estate tax_**

Your estate will not be subject to United States federal estate tax on notes beneficially owned by you
at the time of your death, provided that any payment to you on the notes would be eligible for
exemption from the 30% federal withholding tax under the ‘‘portfolio interest rule’’ described above
under ‘‘United States federal withholding tax’’ without regard to the statement requirement described
in the last bullet point.

#### Information reporting and backup withholding

**_U.S. holder_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and interest on
notes and to the proceeds of sale of a note paid to U.S. Holders other than certain exempt recipients
(such as corporations). A backup withholding tax will apply to such payments if you fail to provide a
taxpayer identification number or certification of other exempt status or fail to report full dividend and
interest income.

Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit
against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is furnished
to the IRS.

**_Non-U.S. holder_**

Generally, we must report to the IRS and to you the amount of interest paid to you and the amount of
tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments. Copies of the information returns reporting such
interest payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the
country in which you reside under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty.

In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments that we make to
you provided that we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States
person, as defined under the Code, and we have received from you the statement described above
in the last bullet point under ‘‘United States federal withholding tax.’’

236


-----

In addition, you will be subject to information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup
withholding with respect to the proceeds of the sale of a note within the United States or conducted
through certain United States-related financial intermediaries, unless the payor receives the
statement described above and does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a
United States person, as defined under the Code, or you otherwise establish an exemption.

Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit
against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is furnished
to the IRS.

237

## Material ERISA considerations

The following is a summary of material considerations associated with the purchase of the notes and
notes by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements
that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any federal, state, local, non-United
States or other laws, rules or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code
(collectively, ‘‘Similar Laws’’), and entities whose underlying assets are considered to include plan
assets’’ of such plans (as defined in the regulations promulgated under ERISA), accounts and
arrangements (each, a ‘‘Plan’’).

#### General fiduciary matters

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an ‘‘ERISA Plan’’) and prohibit certain transactions involving
the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the
Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such
an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who
renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally
considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing
the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s
duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

#### Prohibited transaction issues

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are ‘‘parties in interest,’’ within the
meaning of ERISA, or ‘‘disqualified persons,’’ within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless
an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a nonexempt
prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA
and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a nonexempt
prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The
acquisition and/or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we or the initial
purchasers or any joint book-running manager or guarantor are considered a party in interest or
disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section
406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in
accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this
regard, the United States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions
(‘‘PTCEs’’) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions
include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified
professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1, respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts,
PTCE-91-38, respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60, respecting life insurance
company general accounts and PTCE 96-23, respecting transactions determined by in-house asset
managers, although there can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will
be satisfied.

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing ‘‘plan
assets’’ of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding (and the exchange of notes for notes) will not
constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any
applicable Similar Laws.

#### Representation

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note or an note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be
deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such

238


-----

purchaser or transferee to acquire and hold the notes constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the
purchase and holding of the notes (and the exchange of notes for notes) by such purchaser or
transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and
the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is
particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the notes (and holding
the notes or notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding
the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such
transactions and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the
notes.

## Plan of distribution

Subject to the terms and conditions in the purchase agreement among us, the guarantors and the
initial purchasers, we sold to J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, Lehman
Brothers Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC, Scotia Capital (USA)
Inc., TD Securities (USA) Inc. and SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc. (the ‘‘dollar initial purchasers’’), and
the dollar initial purchasers purchased from us, the entire principal amount of the dollar notes and we
sold to J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., Credit Suisse First Boston Europe Ltd., Lehman Brothers
International (Europe), Deutsche Bank AG London, Banc of America Securities Limited, Scotia
Capital Inc., TD Securities (USA) Inc. and SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc. (the ‘‘euro initial
purchasers’’ and together with the dollar initial purchasers, the ‘‘initial purchasers’’), and the euro
initial purchasers purchased from us, the entire principal amount of the euro notes.

The respective initial purchasers offered the notes for resale at the respective issue price that
appears on the cover of this listing memorandum. After the initial offering, the respective initial
purchasers may change the offering price and any other selling terms without notice. The initial
purchasers may offer and sell the notes through certain of their affiliates.

In the purchase agreement, we have agreed that:

� We will not offer or sell any of our debt securities (other than the notes and the notes) for a
period of 180 days after the date of the offering memorandum without the prior consent of J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc., in the case of the dollar notes, or of J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., in the
case of the euro notes.

� We will indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make
in respect of those liabilities.

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
place. In the purchase agreement, each initial purchaser has agreed that:

� The notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to United States persons
except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in
transactions not subject to those registration requirements.

� During the initial distribution of the notes, it will offer or sell the notes only to qualified
institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A and outside the United States in compliance
with Regulation S.

In the purchase agreement, each initial purchaser has also agreed that:

� It has not offered or sold and, prior to the date six months after the date of issuance of the
notes, will not offer or sell any notes to persons in the United Kingdom except to persons
whose ordinary activities involve them in acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of
investments (as principal or agent) for the purposes of their businesses or otherwise in
circumstances which have not resulted and will not result in an offer to the public in the United
Kingdom within the meaning of the Public Offers of Securities Regulations 1995 (as
amended).

� It has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause
to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in
connection with the issue or sale of any notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not apply to us or the guarantors.

� It has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the notes in, from or
otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

The notes are new issues of securities, and an established trading market for the notes may not
develop. In addition, the notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described
under ‘‘Transfer restrictions’’. We intend to apply for the dollar notes and the euro notes to be listed
on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Dollar notes that are sold to qualified institutional buyers will be
eligible for trading in the PORTAL market. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to
make a market in the notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The initial purchasers may
discontinue any market-making in the notes at any time in their sole discretion. Accordingly, we
cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the notes, that you will be able to sell
your notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp
taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

In connection with the offering of the notes, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., on behalf of the dollar initial
purchasers, and J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., on behalf of the euro initial purchasers, may engage in
overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves
sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers.
Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the notes in the open market for the purpose of
pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve
purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover
short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of
the notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the initial
purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at
any time.

Certain of the initial purchasers and their affiliates perform various financial advisory, investment
banking and commercial banking services from time to time for us and our affiliates and may, from
time to time in the future engage in transactions with, or perform services for, us in the ordinary
course of their businesses. J.P Morgan Securities Inc. and Lehman Brothers Inc. acted as financial
advisors to Blackstone in connection with the Acquisition. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. is the
administrative agent under our receivables facility and an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, which is
the administrative agent and a lender under our senior credit facilities. Credit Suisse First Boston
LLC is an affiliate of Credit Suisse First Boston, New York branch, which is a funding agent under our
receivables facility, and an affiliate of Credit Suisse First Boston, which is a lender under our senior
credit facilities. Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Inc. is a funding
agent under our receivables facility and a lender under our senior credit facilities. Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. is the administrative agent under our receivables facility and an affiliate of Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas, Deutsche Bank A.G., New York Branch and Deutsche Bank A.G.,
Cayman Islands Branch which are lenders under our senior credit facilities. Banc of America
Securities LLC is an affiliate of Bank of America, N.A., which is a documentation agent and arranger
and a lender under our senior credit facilities.

## Glossary of selected terms

_Active control retractor system. A system that uses braking sensors and stability control sensor_
information to react to potentially hazardous driving situations. Seat belt retractors driven by an
electric motor reduce seat belt slack prior to a potential crash.

_Active cruise control. A cruise control system that uses radar to monitor distance to a leading vehicle_
and automatically decelerates or accelerates the vehicle to maintain appropriate following distance.

_Active roll control system. A system that adjusts the suspension during vehicle turning maneuvers to_
reduce vehicle sway, providing increased comfort and reduced roll-over potential.

_Active safety system. A system, such as the braking system or the steering system, that can reduce_
the possibility of an accident or reduce the potential injuries to the vehicle occupants.

_Actuation boosters and master cylinders. An actuation booster is the brake vacuum booster which_
‘‘multiplies’’ the driver brake pedal force to the brake system. The master cylinder is the hydraulic
cylinder which receives pedal force input from the driver and transmits hydraulic pressure to the
individual brakes. These two components are usually provided as an assembly.

_Air bag. Passive safety devices that rapidly expand and fill with gas to provide an energy-absorbing_
and protective cushion for vehicle occupants when a crash is detected.

_Anti-lock braking system (ABS). A system that reduces likelihood of wheel skid during braking by_
automatically pulsing hydraulic brake pressure to the appropriate wheel(s) when wheel rotation speed
signal indicates impending wheel skid.

_Body control products. See array of products listed for body control product line under the section_
entitled ‘‘Business—Operating segments and principal product categories—Other Automotive.’’

_Corner module. A module assembly consisting of suspension and brake components shipped as an_
end item to a vehicle assembly plant.

_Curtain airbag. An air bag device, attached to the roof rail and stored in the roof liner above the_
vehicle’s doors, that inflates rapidly during certain side impact collisions to fill the space between the
occupants and the sides of the vehicle. The curtain air bag provides an energy absorbing cushion
that helps protect the head and neck of occupants during a side-impact collision.

_Crash sensor. An electronic module that senses a vehicle crash and deploys the air bags and, if_
equipped with pretensioners, seat belts accordingly.

_Disc brake caliper. A component of a disc brake system that clamps the rotor to provide braking_
force.

_Drum brake. A traditional brake assembly design using brake pads which expand to contact the inner_
diameter of a drum, thereby providing brake force.

_Drum. The cast iron drum against which the brake pads on a drum brake assembly are expanded to_
provide brake force.

_Electrically assisted power steering system. See ‘‘Industry overview—Steering systems.’’_

_Electrically powered hydraulic steering system. See ‘‘Industry overview—Steering systems.’’_

_Electro-hydraulic braking system. See ‘‘Industry overview—Braking systems.’’_

_Electronic vehicle stability control system (VSC). A system building on the technology of ABS. VSC_
monitors steering angles, transverse acceleration, yaw, wheel speed and brake pressure to detect
loss of traction. When wheels begin to lose traction causing the vehicle to become less stable, VSC
can reduce engine power or apply brake pressure to any or all wheels as required to maintain the
vehicle’s intended path.

_Engine valve. The component known as the ‘‘heart’’ of the engine. There are two types of valves:_
inlet and exhaust. Their function is to open and close in a chamber allowing gases in and forcing

249


-----

them out after combustion. Exhaust valves are typically made of higher grade nickel based steels
while inlet valves are typically made from more common carbon based steels. The trend in engine
design is to increase the number of valves per cylinder from two to four, resulting in more power,
more efficiency and cleaner burns.

_Foundation brakes. General term meaning traditional brake system components including disc and/or_
drum brakes. See the table of product lines in ‘‘Business—Operating segments and principal product
categories—Chassis Systems.’’

_Module. A collection of individual components into a single assembly, (e.g. the collection of a bag, an_
inflator, a cover and mounting brackets into an air bag module). The single assembly has a unique
and definable purpose or function that supercedes the purposes and the functions of the individual
components. In certain applications customers specify and purchase modules rather than the
components separately.

_Passive safety systems. A safety system, such as air bags and seat belts, that reacts to a vehicle_
crash as opposed to reacting prior to a crash.

_Pretensioning system. A seat belt feature that reduces the slack in the seat belt system during a_
vehicle crash to reduce potential injuries to occupants.

_Rear axle modules. A module assembly consisting of axle, suspension, and brake components_
shipped as an end item to a vehicle assembly plant.

_Rotor. The ‘‘disc’’ in a disc brake system that is clamped by calipers to provide braking force._

_Single- and dual-stage air bag inflators. Single stage inflators use one combustion chamber and fill_
the air bag with a certain volume of gas. Dual-stage inflators improve occupant protection and use
dual combustion chambers which are activated based upon crash severity: first chamber fills a
smaller bag volume (small crash), second chamber fills the complete bag volume when activated.

_System. A group of components that combine to form a whole and operate in unison for a specific_
purpose. For example, the components of an occupant safety system generally consist of air bags,
seat belts and crash sensors. In a vehicle collision, the crash sensor sends a signal to the other
components which then operate together to reduce the likelihood or severity of injuries to the
vehicle’s occupants resulting from such collision.

_Tire pressure monitoring system. A system that monitors tire inflation level and lights a dashboard_
indicator to alert driver of low tire inflation. Direct system uses a pressure sensor on each tire.
Indirect system infers tire inflation level from differences in individual wheel speeds.

subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related combined statements of operations,
cash flows and changes in stockholder’s investment for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the combined financial position of TRW Automotive Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and
2001, and the combined results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.

As discussed in Note 5 to the combined financial statements, the Company changed its method
of accounting for goodwill resulting from its adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets’’, effective January 1, 2002.

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to combined financial statements

**1.** **Description of business and change in ownership**

**_Description of business._**

TRW Automotive Inc. (also referred to herein as the ‘‘Company’’) is among the world’s largest and
most diversified suppliers of automotive systems, modules and components to global automotive
vehicle manufacturers, or VMs, and related aftermarkets. The Company conducts substantially all of
its operations through subsidiaries. These operations primarily encompass the design, manufacture
and sale of active and passive safety related products. Active safety related products principally refer
to vehicle dynamic controls (primarily braking and steering), and passive safety related products
principally refer to occupant restraints (primarily air bags and seat belts) and crash sensors. The
Company is primarily a ‘‘Tier-1’’ supplier (a supplier which sells directly to VMs), with over 85% of its
sales in 2002 made directly to VMs.

**_Change of ownership._**

The Company was incorporated in Delaware on June 3, 2002 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRW
Inc. (‘‘TRW’’) in contemplation of the spin-off announced by the TRW Board of Directors in March
2002. The Company consists of TRW’s automotive business including TRW’s subsidiaries and
affiliates associated with the TRW automotive business. Historically, the Company’s business resulted
from the combination of the legacy TRW automotive business with the legacy LucasVarity plc
(‘‘LucasVarity’’) automotive business.

Prior to the consummation of the planned spin-off, TRW entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger with Northrop Grumman Corporation (‘‘Northrop’’), dated June 30, 2002, whereby Northrop
would acquire all of the outstanding common stock of TRW, including TRW’s automotive business, in
exchange for Northrop shares. The acquisition of TRW by Northrop was completed on December 11,
2002 (the ‘‘Merger’’).

Additionally, on November 18, 2002, an entity controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P.
(‘‘Blackstone’’), entered into a Master Purchase Agreement, as amended, pursuant to which TRW
Automotive Holdings Corp. (‘‘Holdings’’), a newly-formed entity, would cause its indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary, TRW Automotive Acquisition Corp. (‘‘TRW Automotive’’), to purchase substantially all of
the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities (other than certain indebtedness) associated
with TRW’s automotive business from Northrop for a purchase price of $4,725 million (including
assumed debt), subject to certain closing and post-closing adjustments (the ‘‘Acquisition’’).

**2.** **Subsequent events**

The Acquisition was completed on February 28, 2003 with a subsidiary of Northrop retaining a 19.6%
interest in TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. As part of the Acquisition, the Company transferred its
interests in TRW’s automotive business to TRW Automotive. Subsequent to the Acquisition, the
Company changed its name to Richmond U.K. Inc. Subsequently, TRW Automotive was renamed
TRW Automotive Inc.

In connection with the Acquisition, TRW Automotive issued senior notes (the ‘‘Senior Notes’’) and
senior subordinated notes (the ‘‘Senior Subordinated Notes’’) in a private offering, entered into new
revolving credit and term loan facilities (the ‘‘Senior Secured Credit Facilities’’) and initiated a trade
accounts receivable securitization program (the ‘‘Receivables Facility’’). Funding for the cash portion
of the purchase price included $1,575 million in proceeds from the notes, $1,510 million in
borrowings under TRW Automotive’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and a cash equity contribution
primarily from affiliates of Blackstone, in exchange for shares of TRW Automotive’s indirect parent,
TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. Employees of TRW Automotive and certain of its subsidiaries also
made cash equity contributions in exchange for shares of TRW Automotive Holdings Corp.

In addition, TRW Automotive assumed certain debt instruments existing at the Acquisition including
10.875% debentures previously issued by LucasVarity due 2020 at face amount of $149 million and

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to combined financial statements (continued)

certain other borrowings, including accrued interest, totaling approximately $60 million. All other
indebtedness described in Note 16, including debt allocated from TRW, was retained by Northrop.

The Senior Notes consist of $925 million, 9[3]⁄8% Senior Notes and t200 million, 10[1]⁄8% Senior Notes,
both due February 15, 2013. The Senior Subordinated Notes consist of $300 million, 11% Senior
Subordinated Notes and t125 million, 11[3]⁄4% Senior Subordinated Notes, both due February 15,
2013. Interest is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 with the first payment due
August 15, 2003. The Senior Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis and
the Senior Subordinated Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated unsecured
basis, in each case, by substantially all existing and future wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and
by TRW Automotive Finance Luxembourg, S.à.r.l. (‘‘TRW Luxembourg’’), a restricted Luxembourg
subsidiary.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities consist of a secured revolving credit facility and various senior
secured term loan facilities. The six-year revolving credit facility, through a syndication of banks,
provides for borrowings up to $500 million including the availability of letters of credit, and is available
in U.S. dollars, euros, pounds sterling and other currencies. The six-year term loan tranche A was
issued in a face amount of $410 million while eight-year term loans tranche B were issued in a face
amount of $1,030 million plus approximately t65 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities loans
generally bear interest at variable rates. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally
guaranteed on a senior secured basis in each case by substantially all existing and future wholly
owned domestic subsidiaries and by TRW Luxembourg. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities are secured by substantially all the assets of TRW Automotive and pledges of the capital
stock of the majority of the domestic and foreign subsidiaries.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Senior Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes contain a number
of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of TRW
Automotive and its subsidiaries, to sell assets, incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock,
repay other indebtedness (including, in the case of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior
Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes), pay certain dividends and distributions or repurchase capital
stock, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, make certain acquisitions,
engage in mergers or consolidations, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, engage in certain
transactions with affiliates, amend certain material agreements governing TRW Automotive
indebtedness (including, in the case of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior Notes, Senior
Subordinated Notes and the Receivables Facility), and change the business conducted by TRW
Automotive and its subsidiaries. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain the following
financial covenants: a maximum total leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, and a
maximum capital expenditures limitation and require certain prepayments from excess cash flows, as
defined.

The Receivables Facility provides up to $600 million in funding. On February 28, 2003, subsidiaries
of TRW Automotive signed a Receivables Purchase Agreement and began selling trade accounts
receivables (the ‘‘Receivables’’) originated by them and certain of their subsidiaries as sellers in the
United States to the Receivables Facility. Receivables are sold to TRW Automotive Receivables LLC
(the ‘‘Transferor’’) at a discount. The Transferor is a bankruptcy-remote special purpose limited
liability company that is a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of TRW Automotive. The Transferor’s
purchase of Receivables is financed through a transfer agreement with TRW Automotive Global
Receivables LLC (the ‘‘Borrower’’). Under the terms of the Transfer Agreement, the Borrower
purchases all Receivables sold to the Transferor. The Borrower is a non-consolidated bankruptcyremote qualifying special purpose limited liability company that is wholly-owned by TRW Automotive
Receivables LLC.

A multi-seller commercial paper conduit supported by a committed liquidity facility is available to
provide cash funding for the Borrowers’ purchase of Receivables through secured loans/tranches to

the extent desired and permitted under the Receivables Loan Agreement. A note is issued for the
difference between Receivables purchased and cash borrowed through the facility. The originators of
the Receivables act as servicing agents per the Servicing Agreement and continue to service the
transferred receivables for which they receive a monthly servicing fee.

On December 30, 2002, Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. and Koyo Delaware, Inc. filed a complaint against
TRW and its then wholly owned subsidiary, TRW Automotive Holding Company, in the Circuit Court
for Monroe County, Tennessee, alleging that TRW violated certain provisions of the partnership
agreement with Koyo under which the parties formed TRW Koyo Steering Systems Company
(‘‘TKS’’). See Note 21. On February 21, 2003, the Circuit Court for Monroe County, Tennessee,
issued a temporary injunction prohibiting the sale to any entity controlled by Blackstone, of the
partnership interest held by TRW Automotive Holding Company in TKS, pending the final hearing of
the matter. On March 7, 2003, Koyo Seiko filed a cross motion for partial summary judgment seeking
a permanent injunction and other relief. On July 30, 2003, the court issued an order, which enjoined
TRW and its subsidiaries and affiliates from: (i) selling or transferring all or any part of its partnership
interest in TKS to Blackstone; (ii) assigning all or part of its rights under the TKS Partnership
Agreement to Blackstone; and (iii) delegating all or part of its obligations under the TKS Partnership
Agreement to Blackstone. The Company has been informed that Northrop has reached an agreement
with Koyo Seiko to sell the 51% interest in TKS to Koyo Seiko.

The combined financial statements of the Company include the assets, liabilities, sales and expenses
of TRW’s automotive business based upon TRW’s historical amounts. Parent Company Investment
represents TRW’s historical investment in the Company including intercompany accounts. The
combined financial statements of the Company do not reflect the push down of purchase accounting
resulting from the Merger.

The Combined Statements of Operations include expenses recorded by the Company or directly
charged to the Company by TRW. In addition, the statements include an allocation of TRW’s general
and administrative corporate expenses to reflect the services provided to the Company or benefits
received by the Company. These services primarily consisted of general corporate management and
governance, finance and accounting, treasury and risk management, human resources and benefits
administration, legal, management information services and other shared support services. The
allocation was $81 million for 2002, $81 million for 2001 and $90 million for 2000 and was reported in
administrative and selling expenses in the Combined Statements of Operations. The allocation was
computed using TRW’s internal allocation methodology, which was based upon an established
percentage applied to the cost of operations (sales less earnings (losses) before taxes from
continuing operations). Given that TRW and Northrop Grumman provided such support services for
the benefit of their entire organizations, it would have been impractical to allocate such expenses in a
more direct manner. Accordingly, management believes that this was a reasonable method for
allocating such general and administrative corporate expenses for those periods. However, as the
scale of operations and nature of the business of TRW differed from that of the Company, these
allocations are not necessarily representative of the operating expenses that would have been
incurred had the Company operated on a stand-alone basis. For each of the years ended December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, management estimates that stand-alone general and administrative
expenses would have been approximately $48 million (unaudited).

Debt, other than debt allocated from TRW, reported on the Combined Balance Sheets represents the
historical third party obligations of the automotive legal entities. Debt allocated from TRW is included
on the Company’s Combined Balance Sheets. This allocation reflects TRW’s historical practice of
incurring most of its indebtedness, including debt incurred to finance the acquisition of the Lucas
Varity automotive business, at the parent company level.

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to combined financial statements (continued)

Interest expense from the specific third party debt obligations attributed to the Company’s operations
is included in the Combined Statements of Operations. In addition, an estimate of the remaining
interest expense of TRW, attributable to the debt allocated to the Company, is also included in the
Combined Statements of Operations. The allocation of debt and interest is based on a ratio of the
Company’s net assets to TRW’s net assets plus non-automotive debt. Management believes that this
is a reasonable method of allocating debt and interest to the Company. This allocation is not,
however, indicative of the total amount of debt and interest that would have been incurred by the
Company as a stand-alone entity.

The Company, primarily for the United States operations, participates in TRW’s centralized cash
management system. Under this system, cash receipts are transferred to TRW and TRW funds cash
disbursements. As such, the amount of cash and cash equivalents does not represent the amount
required or generated by the Company. The balance of cash and cash equivalents on the Combined
Balance Sheets primarily relates to cash and cash equivalents at foreign operations that do not
participate in TRW’s cash management program.

TRW accounts for and pays all United States income taxes. The Company’s taxable income (loss)
related to its United States operations and foreign operations subject to a United States
‘‘check-the-box’’ election to be taxed in the United States is included in TRW’s consolidated income
tax returns. The Combined Statements of Operations include an allocation to the Company of TRW’s
United States income taxes (credits) in amounts generally equivalent to the provisions that would
have resulted had the Company filed separate income tax returns for the years presented. The
Company has also been allocated United States deferred income taxes based on the estimated
differences between the book and tax basis of its assets and liabilities.

Most of the Company’s foreign operations account for and pay foreign income taxes related to their
operations. For those operations that have not separately accounted for and paid income taxes
related to their operations, the Combined Statements of Operations include an allocation of TRW’s
foreign income taxes in amounts generally equivalent to the provisions which would have resulted
had those foreign operations filed separate income tax returns for the years presented. These
operations have also been allocated foreign deferred income taxes based on the estimated
differences between the book and tax basis of their assets and liabilities.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position,
results of operations and cash flows have been presented. The financial information included may not
necessarily reflect the results of operations, financial position, changes in stockholder’s investment in
the future or what they would have been if the Company had been a separate, stand-alone company
for the periods presented.

**4.** **Summary of significant accounting policies**

**_Principles of consolidation._** The combined financial statements include the accounts of the
Company, which include all of TRW’s automotive business and the wholly owned and majority-owned
subsidiaries controlled by the Company. Investments in 20% to 50% owned affiliates are accounted
for under the equity method. Investments other than those that are wholly owned and majority-owned
are recorded in investments in affiliated companies.

**_Use of estimates._** The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities, and reported amounts in the Combined Statements of Operations. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

**_Revenue recognition._** The Company recognizes sales in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, including the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff

F-10


-----

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to combined financial statements (continued)

Accounting Bulletin No. 101, ‘‘Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements’’ (‘‘SAB 101’’), which
requires that sales be recognized when there is evidence of a sales agreement, the delivery of goods
has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of related billings is reasonably
assured. The Company records sales upon shipment of product to customers and transfer of title
under standard commercial terms (typically ‘‘F.O.B. shipping point’’). In those limited instances where
other terms are negotiated and agreed, the Company records revenue when title is transferred to the
customer.

**_Cash and cash equivalents._** Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments
purchased with a maturity date of three months or less.

**_Accounts receivable._** Receivables are stated at amounts estimated by management to be the net
realizable value. The allowance is based on specific identification. The Company charges off
accounts receivable when it becomes apparent based upon age or customer circumstances that
amounts will not be collected. The Company does not typically require collateral.

The Company participated in an accounts receivable securitization arrangement established by TRW
with a financial institution and several financial conduits in 2001 and 2002. At December 31, 2001,
the Company’s retained interest in securitized receivables amounted to $162 million and is reported
as interest in securitized receivables on the Combined Balance Sheet. The securitization
arrangement was terminated in December 2002 (see Note 2 and Note 11).

**_Inventories._** Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
inventories valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method were $47 million and $68 million,
respectively. Inventories not valued by the LIFO method are principally on the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method. Had the cost of all inventories been determined by the FIFO method, inventories at
December 31, 2002 and 2001 would have been greater by $11 million and $15 million, respectively.

**_Depreciation._** Depreciation is computed over the assets’ estimated useful lives, using the
straight-line method for the majority of the Company’s depreciable assets, including capital leases.
The remaining assets are depreciated using accelerated methods. The estimated useful lives of
buildings, machinery and equipment, and computers and other office equipment are between 30 to
40 years, eight to 12 years and three to five years, respectively. Amortization of assets held under
capital leases is included in depreciation expense. Depreciation expense was $479 million, $455
million and $486 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

**_Product tooling._** Product tooling is special purpose tooling that is limited to the manufacture of a
specific part or parts of the same basic design. Product tooling includes dies, patterns, molds and
jigs. Customer owned tooling for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by the customer or
for which the Company has a non-cancelable right to use the tooling is classified within other assets
on the Combined Balance Sheet. When approved for billing to the customer, such charges are
reclassified into accounts receivable. Tooling owned by the Company is capitalized as property, plant
and equipment, and amortized as cost of sales over its estimated economic life, not exceeding five
years.

**_Goodwill and other intangible assets._** Effective January 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer being
amortized but is subject to impairment analysis annually or if an event occurs or circumstances
indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the
reporting unit level (defined as an operating segment, as that term is used in Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (‘‘SFAS’’) 131, ‘‘Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information,’’ or one level below the operating segment, depending on whether certain criteria are
met). The carrying value of assets, including goodwill, and liabilities are assigned to each reporting
unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is then determined and compared to the carrying value. If
carrying value exceeds fair value, then a possible impairment of goodwill exists and requires further
evaluation.

F-11


-----

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to combined financial statements (continued)

Prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill acquired after 1970 was amortized by the straight-line method over
40 years. Goodwill acquired prior to 1971, $47 million, was not being amortized.

Other intangible assets include capitalized internal-use software, patents and licenses and other
identifiable intangible assets acquired through acquisitions. Capitalized internal-use software is being
amortized over periods not to exceed 10 years. Other identifiable intangible assets are being
amortized primarily over five to 17 years. Amortization expense is estimated at $35 million for each of
the five succeeding years and will be recorded in cost of sales, administrative and selling expenses
and amortization of intangible assets.

**_Asset impairment._** The Company records asset impairment losses on long-lived and intangible
assets when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the
undiscounted net cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying
amounts. If the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the
assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair values. The Company determines fair value by appraisals
and discounted cash flow calculations.

**_Cost basis equity affiliates._** The Company’s investments in affiliated companies include equity
securities, accounted for using the cost method, which are classified as available-for-sale. These
securities are stated at estimated fair value based upon market quotes where available. Unrealized
gains and losses, net of tax, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in stockholder’s investment until realized. A decline in the value of any
investment below cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged to earnings.

**_Environmental costs._** The Company participates in environmental assessments and remediation
efforts at operating facilities, previously owned or operated facilities, and Superfund or other waste
sites. Costs related to these locations are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated. Estimated costs are recorded
at undiscounted amounts, based on experience and assessments, and are regularly evaluated as
efforts proceed.

**_Warranties. The Company records product warranty liability based upon management estimates_**
including such factors as the written agreement between the Company and the customer, the length
of the warranty period, the historical performance of the product and likely changes in performance of
newer products and the mix and volume of products sold. The liability is reviewed on a regular basis
and adjusted to reflect actual experience.

The following table presents the movement in the product warranty liability for the year ended
December 31, 2002:

**intended**

2002 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $61 $49 $(45) $(22) $43

Apart from product warranties, the Company also incurs recall costs when they or the customer
decide to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a
known or suspected safety concern.

**_Research and development._** Company-funded research and development programs include
research and development for commercial products that are expensed as incurred.

**_Shipping and handling._** Shipping costs include payments to third-party shippers to move the
product to the customer. Handling costs include costs from the point the product is removed from
finished goods inventory to when provided to the shipper. Shipping and handling costs are expensed
as incurred as costs of sales.

F-12

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to combined financial statements (continued)

**_Pre-production costs._** The Company incurs pre-production engineering and research and
development costs related to the products produced for its customers. The Company expenses all
pre-production costs for which the customer does not contractually guarantee reimbursement.

**_Financial instruments._** The Company adopted SFAS 133, ‘‘Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities,’’ as amended, on January 1, 2001. SFAS 133 requires companies to
recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value. The transition
adjustment recorded as a result of the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Under SFAS 133, the gain or loss on derivative instruments that have been designated and qualify
as hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability, as well as the
offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item, are recognized in net earnings during the period of the
change in fair values. For derivative instruments that have been designated and qualify as hedges of
the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, the gain or loss on the derivative is initially
reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the Combined
Statement of Operations when the hedged transaction affects net earnings. Any gain or loss on the
derivative in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged
item is recognized in net earnings during the period of change. For derivative instruments that are a
hedge of a net investment in a foreign currency, the gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive
income (loss) as part of foreign currency exchange loss. Derivatives not designated as hedges are
adjusted to fair value through net earnings.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 133, changes in market value of contracts that hedged firm foreign
currency commitments and intercompany transactions were generally included in the basis of the
transactions and changes in the market value of the contracts that hedged anticipated transactions
were generally recognized in net earnings.

**_Stock-based compensation._** At December 31, 2002, certain employees of the Company hold
stock options under employee compensation plans that are described more fully in Note 19. The
recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, ‘‘Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees’’, and related Interpretations are applied in accounting for those plans. No stock-based
employee compensation expense has been reflected in net income as all options granted under
those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant.

The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123, ‘‘Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation’’, to stock-based
employee compensation:

**For the Years Ended December 31,**
**(Dollars in millions)** **2000** **2001** **2002**

Adjusted net earnings (losses), fair value method . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $93 $(31) $155

**_Recent accounting pronouncements._** In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(‘‘FASB’’) issued SFAS 143, ‘‘Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations’’. SFAS 143 requires the
fair value of a liability for asset retirement obligations to be recorded in the period in which it is
incurred. The statement applies to a company’s legal or contractual obligation associated with the
retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that resulted from the acquisition, construction or

F-13

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to combined financial statements (continued)

development or through the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The statement is effective for the
Company beginning January 1, 2003. Management has evaluated the impact of SFAS 143 and
believes that its adoption should not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 145, ‘‘Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections.’’ SFAS 145 requires gains and
losses on extinguishments of debt to be reclassified as income or loss from continuing operations
rather than as extraordinary items as previously required by SFAS 4, ‘‘Reporting Gains and Losses
from Extinguishment of Debt.’’ SFAS 145 also amends SFAS 13 requiring certain modifications to
capital leases to be treated as sale-leaseback transactions and to subleases when the original lessee
remains a secondary obligor, or guarantor.

The provisions of SFAS 145 related to the rescission of SFAS 4 are effective for the Company on
January 1, 2003. The extraordinary gain recorded for the extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of
2002 will be reclassified into earnings from continuing operations on January 1, 2003. The remaining
provisions of SFAS 145 were effective for transactions and reporting subsequent to May 15, 2002
and were adopted by the Company as of that date. The adoption of these provisions did not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, ‘‘Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities.’’ SFAS 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with exit or disposal activities be
recognized when the liability is incurred rather than when an entity commits to an exit plan. SFAS
146 also provides that the liability be initially measured at fair value. The statement is effective for the
Company beginning January 1, 2003. Management has evaluated the impact of SFAS 146 and
believes its adoption should not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operation
or cash flows.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, ‘‘Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,’’
which expands the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees
such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the
company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that
guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. The initial
recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements
of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. Management has evaluated the impact
of this Interpretation and believes its adoption should not have a material impact on its financial
position, results of operation or cash flows.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, ‘‘Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,’’ which addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets,
liabilities and activities of another entity. Interpretation No. 46 requires consolidation of a variable
interest entity if the reporting entity is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest
entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the variable interest entity’s residual returns or
both. The consolidation requirements of Interpretation 46 apply immediately to variable interest
entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to entities created prior
to February 1, 2003 in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain
disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements initially issued after January 31, 2003.
Management has evaluated the impact of FASB Interpretation No. 46 and believes that its adoption
should not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

**_Reclassifications._** Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to combined financial statements (continued)

**5.** **Goodwill and other intangible assets**

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142, ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets’’.
SFAS No. 142 sets forth the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets already recorded.
Commencing January 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer being amortized, but is subject to annual
impairment analysis. Goodwill impairment testing is required to be performed at the reporting unit
level (defined as an operating segment, as that term is used in SFAS No. 131, or one level below the
operating segment, depending on whether certain criteria are met). The carrying value of assets,
including goodwill, and liabilities are assigned to each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting
unit is then determined and compared to the carrying value. If carrying value exceeds fair value, then
a possible impairment of goodwill exists and requires further evaluation.

Goodwill was tested for impairment as of January 1, 2002 by comparing the fair values of the
Company’s three reporting units to their carrying values. The Company determined estimated fair
values of its reporting units based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a
9% discount rate and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill. With the adoption of SFAS No.
142, the Company reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all acquired intangible assets to
make any necessary amortization period adjustments, which resulted in no adjustments being made.
In accordance with the statement, amounts in 2001 have not been restated.

The following table reflects the reconciliation of reported earnings from continuing operations before
extraordinary items to adjusted net earnings for the exclusion of goodwill amortization.

**6.** **Discontinued operations**

In 2000, the Company disposed of a substantial portion of the Lucas Diesel Systems and the Lucas
Varity wiring businesses. In 2001, the Company completed the disposition of the remaining Lucas
Diesel Systems businesses. The combined financial statements reflect as discontinued operations for
all periods presented these businesses’ operating results. The tax expense included in discontinued
operations on the Combined Statements of Operations for 2001 and 2000 was $4 million and $2
million, respectively. Net proceeds totaled $29 million in 2001 and $853 million in 2000. Sales of the
discontinued operations were $20 million and $74 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Interest has
not been allocated to discontinued operations. In 2001, the Company recorded a $10 million gain on
the sale of discontinued operations, which is included in the net results of discontinued operations.
No gain or loss resulted from the divestiture of these businesses in 2000.

**7.** **Restructuring**

The Company has initiated several restructuring actions including reorganizing and downsizing its
operations. In 2002, charges of $59 million before tax, of which $32 million was non-cash, were
recorded for actions that resulted in the closing of three plants and expected employee reductions of

F-15


-----

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to combined financial statements (continued)

approximately 1,100. Approximately 800 employees were terminated as a result of these actions as
of December 31, 2002. In 2001, charges of $213 million before tax were recorded for actions that
included the consolidation of its businesses. These actions are expected to result in a reduction of
approximately 6,100 employees, of which approximately 6,000 were terminated by these actions as
of December 31, 2002. In 2000, charges of $85 million were recorded for actions that resulted in
employee reductions of approximately 3,700, the closing of two plants and the reorganization and
downsizing of the Company’s aftermarket business. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, cash payments of $142
million, $116 million and $73 million, respectively, were made for severance and costs related to the
consolidation of certain facilities. Of the $61 million restructuring reserve at December 31, 2002,
approximately $43 million is expected to be paid in 2003. An additional $18 million relates to
involuntary employee termination arrangements outside the United States to be paid over the next
several years in accordance with local law.

In 1999 and 2000, the Company initiated restructuring actions to dispose of several non-strategic or
inefficient facilities, discontinue production of low-margin products and relocate certain facilities
related to the integration of the Lucas Varity automotive businesses. The Company recorded
approximately $45 million of restructuring costs, primarily severance, as part of the purchase price
allocation. In 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999, $1 million, $15 million, $15 million and $14 million,
respectively, were used primarily for severance payments.

The following table illustrates the movement of the restructuring reserves:

2002 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 145 17 42 — (143) 61

**8.** **Asset impairments**

In 2002, Occupant Safety Systems and Other Automotive segments recorded asset impairment
charges of $11 million and $6 million, respectively. Of these charges, $10 million related to the
write-down of the investment in two affiliates to fair market value. The remaining $7 million related
primarily to the write-down of property, plant and equipment to fair value. Of these charges, $9 million
is recorded in other income-net, $7 million in cost of sales and $1 million in amortization of intangible
assets.

In 2001, Chassis Systems, Occupant Safety Systems and Other Automotive segments recorded
asset impairment charges totaling $28 million, $10 million and $12 million, respectively. These
charges, primarily related to the write-down of property, plant and equipment, were recorded as
$38 million in cost of sales, $11 million in other income-net and $1 million in amortization of intangible
assets. Of these charges, $49 million was a result of the reduction of volume, consolidation of
production and outsourcing at certain facilities.

In 2000, as the result of a plan to consolidate operations of its Mesa air bag manufacturing facilities
in the Occupant Safety Systems segment, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of
approximately $52 million in cost of sales. The Company completed the consolidation plan during the
first half of 2002. Property, plant and equipment were written down to fair value on the basis of
discounted estimated future cash flows and future salvage value. Also in 2000, the Other Automotive
segment recorded an asset impairment charge of $15 million in cost of sales as a result of a
reduction of volume at one site that allowed us to consolidate production. Assets were written down
to fair value based upon current market values of the assets.

**10.** **Operating segments**

The Company is a U.S.-based international company providing advanced technology products and
services for the automotive markets. The Company reports in three operating segments: Chassis
Systems, Occupant Safety Systems and Other Automotive. The reporting of the automotive business
as three segments is consistent with the manner in which the Company is managed and by which
resources are allocated by the chief operating decision maker.

The principal customers for the Company’s automotive products are the North and South American,
European and Asian vehicle manufacturers and independent distributors.

The Company designs, manufactures and sells a broad range of steering, suspension and braking
products, seat belts, airbags, steering wheels, safety electronics, engine valves, engineered fastening
body control systems and other components and systems for passenger cars, light trucks and
commercial vehicles. A description of the products and services provided by each of the operating
segments follows.

**_Chassis Systems—active safety systems and other systems and components in the areas of_**
foundation brakes, ABS and other brake control and steering gears and systems;

**_Occupant Safety Systems—passive safety systems and components in the areas of airbags, seat_**
belts and crash sensors and other safety and security electronics; and

**_Other Automotive—engine valves, engineered fasteners and plastic components and body controls._**
Stud welding systems and several sensors and components businesses were divested during 2000.

The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the ‘‘Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies’’ note to combined financial statements. The Company evaluates
operating performance based on segment profit before taxes and segment assets.

The following income and expense items are not included in segment profit before taxes:

   - Corporate expense and other, which primarily represents costs associated with corporate
staff and related expenses, including certain litigation. Corporate expense includes an
allocation of TRW’s cost to reflect the services provided to the Company or benefits received
by the Company.

   - Financing cost, which represents debt-related interest, including interest allocated from TRW,
and the loss on the sale of receivables.

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to combined financial statements (continued)

   - Net employee benefits income, which includes pension income related to retirees and
terminated vested individuals acquired as part of the Lucas Varity acquisition, net of interest
related to other post-retirement employee benefits.

   - Amortization of goodwill.

Segment assets are net of segment current operating liabilities other than taxes. In addition, segment
assets exclude prepaid pension cost for corporate and divested operations, goodwill, unrealized
gains or losses on securities of affiliate investments accounted for using the cost method, deferred
income tax assets and corporate assets.

**11.** **Accounts receivable securitization**

In November 2001, TRW entered into a $350 million accounts receivable securitization agreement
with a financial institution and several financial conduits. TRW established a wholly-owned,
fully-consolidated, bankruptcy-remote, special purpose subsidiary, TRW Receivables Inc., which is
included in the combined financial statements of the Company, for the purpose of purchasing
accounts receivable of TRW and the Company, including receivables purchased by TRW from certain
of its and the Company’s subsidiaries, and selling an undivided interest in the receivables to the
financial conduits. The agreement provides that collections of receivables are to be reinvested in new
accounts receivable. In accordance with the agreement, TRW services and collects the receivables
on behalf of the financial conduits. The conduits and the special purpose subsidiary have no recourse
to other assets of the Company or of TRW for failure of debtors to pay when due.

The securitization transactions are accounted for as a sale of the receivables under the provisions of
SFAS 140, ‘‘Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities,’’ and are removed from the Combined Balance Sheet. The proceeds received are included
in cash flows from operating activities in the Combined Statements of Cash Flows. Financing
expenses paid to the conduits are recorded as loss on sale of receivables in the Combined
Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2001 receivables aggregating $489 million had been
sold to the special purpose subsidiary including $64 million of which had been purchased from TRW
businesses other than the Company. The undivided interest at December 31, 2001 in the receivables
portfolio transferred to the financial conduits amounted to $327 million. The book value of the
Company’s retained interest in the receivables of $162 million at December 31, 2001 approximates
fair market value due to the current nature of the receivables.

Net cash flows paid to the special purpose subsidiary for the year ended December 31, 2002 were
$327 million. The accounts receivable securitization agreement was terminated in December 2002.

See Note 2 for a discussion of the accounts receivable securitization program initiated in connection
with the Acquisition.

The fair value of long-term debt was determined by quoted market prices for publicly traded debt and
was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Company’s current borrowing
rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements for long-term debt without a quoted market price.
The fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts was estimated using a discounted cash flow
analysis based on quoted market prices of offsetting contracts.

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to combined financial statements (continued)

**_Foreign currency forward contracts._** The Company manufactures and sells its products in
countries throughout the world. As a result, it is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates. The Company enters into forward contracts and, to a lesser extent, purchases currency options
to hedge portions of its foreign currency denominated forecasted revenues, purchases and the
subsequent cash flows after maximizing natural offsets within the consolidated group. The critical
terms of the hedges are the same as the underlying forecasted transactions, and the hedges are
considered to be effective to offset the changes in fair value of cash flows from the hedged
transactions. Gains or losses on these instruments, which mature at various dates through December
2003, are generally recorded in other comprehensive earnings (losses) until the underlying
transaction is recognized in net earnings. The earnings impact is reported in either sales, cost of
sales, or other income-net, to match the underlying transaction.

The amount of gains and losses reclassified into net earnings in 2002 as a result of the
discontinuation of cash flow hedges was immaterial.

In addition, the Company enters into certain foreign currency forward contracts that are not treated
as hedges under SFAS 133 to hedge recognized foreign currency transactions. Gains and losses on
these contracts are recorded in net earnings and are substantially offset by the earnings effect of the
revaluation of the underlying foreign currency denominated transaction.

Foreign exchange contracts are placed either through TRW, or directly with a number of major
financial institutions to minimize credit risk. No collateral is held in relation to the contracts, and the
Company anticipates that these financial institutions will satisfy their obligations under the contracts.

The following table represents the movement of amounts reported in other comprehensive income
earnings (losses) of deferred cash flow hedges, net of tax:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income
tax purposes. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had unused tax benefits of $57 million
and $82 million, respectively, primarily related to non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for
income tax purposes, of which $26 million and $57 million, respectively, can be carried forward

indefinitely and the balance expires at various dates through 2012. A valuation allowance at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, of $57 million and $75 million, respectively, has been recognized to
offset the related deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of the loss
carryforwards.

It is the Company’s intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, thereby
indefinitely postponing their remittance. Accordingly, deferred income taxes have not been provided
for accumulated undistributed earnings of $1,118 million at December 31, 2002. It is not practicable
to estimate the additional income taxes and applicable withholding that would be payable on the
remittance of such undistributed earnings.

The assumptions used in the measurement of the benefit obligations for the active and retired
Company-designated employees at December 31 are shown in the following table:

**2001** **2002**
**U.S.** **Non-U.S.** **U.S.** **Non-U.S.**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.25% 3.00–6.50% 6.50% 3.00–6.50%
Rate of increase in compensation levels . . . . . . . . . . . 4.10% 2.00–4.00% 4.00% 2.00–4.00%

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for United States plans was 9.0% and 9.5% for
2002 and 2001, respectively. For non-United States plans the expected long-term rate of return
ranged from 4.0% to 8.75% in 2002 and 2001.

TRW sponsors a contributory stock ownership and savings plan for which a majority of
Company-designated United States employees are eligible and under which TRW matches employee
contributions up to three percent of the participant’s qualified compensation. TRW contributions are
held in an unleveraged employee stock ownership plan. The Company also sponsors other defined
contribution pension plans covering Company-designated employees at some of its operations.

**15.** **Post-retirement benefits other than pensions**

During the periods presented, TRW provided health care and life insurance benefits for a majority of
Company-designated retired employees in the United States and Canada. The health care plans
provide for cost sharing, in the form of employee contributions, deductibles and coinsurance,
between TRW and its retirees. Approximately 70% of the active plan participants in the Company’s
post-retirement health care plans are subject to provisions which limit the annual increase in the
Company’s contribution toward the plan’s cost to a maximum of the lesser of 50 percent of medical
inflation or four percent, which should limit the long-term growth of plan liabilities. However,
approximately 80% of inactive plan participants are covered by benefits with no inflationary cap and,
therefore, constitute a substantial majority of existing post-retirement health care benefit liabilities.
Life insurance benefits are generally noncontributory. TRW’s policy is to fund the cost of
post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits in amounts determined at the discretion of
management. Retirees in certain other countries are provided similar benefits by plans sponsored by
their governments.

of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for 2002 was assumed to range
from 5.25% to 10.00%. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to a range of 2.25% to 5.25%
in the year 2010 and remain at that level, thereafter.

The Company has borrowings under uncommitted credit agreements in many of the countries in
which it operates. These borrowings are primarily in the local foreign currency of the country or
region where the Company’s operations are located. The borrowings are from various domestic and
international banks at quoted market interest rates. Some of these borrowings are supported by
guarantees from TRW. The weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings outstanding at
December 31, 2002 and 2001 was 4.9% and 6.3%, respectively.

Capital lease arrangements are provided by several financial institutions, primarily in the United
Kingdom and Germany, at rates ranging from 3.0% to 7.5% and expire at various dates through
2015. Other borrowings bear interest at rates ranging from 2.5% to 8.0% and mature at various dates
through 2012.

The weighted-average interest rate on debt allocated from TRW at December 31, 2002 and 2001
was 8.6% and 8.3%, respectively. Interest expense allocated from TRW was $281 million, $323
million and $331 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The maturities of long-term debt are: 2003-$17 million; 2004-$18 million; 2005-$9 million; 2006-$5
million; 2007-$3 million; and $267 million thereafter.

Compensating balance arrangements and fees were not material.

Agreement, as amended, Holdings is required to use its reasonable best efforts to cause itself or its
affiliate to be substituted for TRW in automotive related guarantees provided by TRW prior to
February 28, 2003 and that Holdings is required to indemnify and hold TRW and Northrop harmless
from and against any losses resulting from any payment following February 28, 2003 by TRW or any
of its subsidiaries under such guarantees.

**17.** **Lease commitments**

The Company leases certain offices, manufacturing and research buildings, machinery, automobiles
and computer and other equipment. Such leases, some of which are noncancelable and in many
cases include renewals, expire at various dates. The Company pays most maintenance, insurance
and tax expenses relating to leased assets. Rental expense for operating leases was $86 million for
2002, $82 million for 2001 and $91 million for 2000.

At December 31, 2002, the future minimum lease payments for noncancelable operating leases
totaled $204 million and are payable as follows: 2003-$53 million; 2004-$42 million; 2005-$33 million;
2006-$26 million; 2007-$19 million; and $31 million thereafter.

**18.** **Capital stock**

The Company was incorporated by TRW in Delaware on June 3, 2002 with a capitalization of 500
million shares of $0.001 par value common stock authorized and one share of common stock
outstanding. In addition, 50 million shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.001 per
share, were authorized, none of which have been issued.

**19.** **Stock options**

TRW granted nonqualified stock options to certain Company-designated employees to purchase
common stock at the market price on the date of grant. Stock options granted to employees were
exercisable to the extent of one-third of the optioned shares for each full year of employment
following the date of grant and expire 10 years after the date of grant. The Company applies the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) 25, ‘‘Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,’’ in accounting for its employee stock options and, as such, no compensation expense is
recognized as the exercise price equals the market price of the stock on the date of grant.

During 2002, options were granted to Company-designated employees for an aggregate of
approximately 444,000 shares of TRW stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $37.00 per

F-29

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to combined financial statements (continued)

share and a weighted average fair value of $9.21 per share. During 2002, options for approximately
1,135,000 shares were exercised, canceled or terminated through December 11, 2002.

In connection with the Merger, Company-designated employees holding options to purchase TRW
stock became fully vested in such options and were given the opportunity to either exercise their
options (cash-out) or convert them into Northrop stock options at December 11, 2002 in such a
manner that their aggregate intrinsic value immediately before and after the exchange were the
same. At December 11, 2002, options for approximately 300,000 shares were paid out in cash while
options for the remaining approximately 2,167,000 shares were converted to options for Northrop
shares using a conversion rate of .5357 Northrop shares per TRW share, consistent with the tender
offer rate associated with the Merger. At December 31, 2002, there are options outstanding and held
by Company-designated employees for approximately 1,162,000 Northrop shares, all of which
options are vested, with exercise prices ranging from $59.80 to $109.90, and a weighted-average
remaining contractual life of approximately 6.8 years.

Had the compensation cost for the stock options granted in 2002, 2001 and 2000 been determined
based on the fair value at the grant date, consistent with the fair value method of SFAS 123,
‘‘Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,’’ the Company’s net earnings (loss) would have been
effected by additional costs of $9 million in 2002 including the impact of accelerated recognition of
compensation cost due to the change of control, $6 million in 2001, and $4 million in 2000.

Fair value was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the
following weighted-average assumptions for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively: risk-free interest rate
of 4.5%, 4.71%, and 5.83%; dividend yield of 3.00%, 2.85%, and 2.61%; expected volatility of 28%,
28%, and 27%; and an expected option life of six years for 2002, 2001 and 2000.

**21.** **Contingencies**

Various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings are pending or threatened against the
Company or its subsidiaries, covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its
business activities with respect to commercial, product liability and environmental matters. In addition,
the Company and its subsidiaries are conducting a number of environmental investigations and
remedial actions at current and former locations of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. Along with
other companies, certain subsidiaries of the Company have been named potentially responsible
parties for certain waste management sites. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties,
and some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably with respect to the Company. A reserve

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to combined financial statements (continued)

estimate for each environmental matter is established using standard engineering cost estimating
techniques on an undiscounted basis. In the determination of such costs, consideration is given to
the professional judgment of Company environmental engineers, in consultation with outside
environmental specialists, when necessary. At multi-party sites, the reserve estimate also reflects the
expected allocation of total project costs among the various potentially responsible parties. At
December 31, 2002, the Company had reserves for environmental matters of $102 million, including
a favorable adjustment of $8 million recorded during the year. The Company believes any liability that
may result from the resolution of environmental matters for which sufficient information is available to
support these cost estimates will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position or results of operations. However, the Company cannot predict the effect on the Company’s
financial position of expenditures for aspects of certain matters for which there is insufficient
information. In addition, the Company cannot predict the effect of compliance with environmental laws
and regulations with respect to unknown environmental matters on the Company’s financial position
or results of operations or the possible effect of compliance with environmental requirements imposed
in the future.

Further, product liability claims may be asserted in the future for events not currently known by
management. Although the ultimate liability from these potential claims cannot be ascertained at
December 31, 2002, management does not anticipate that any related liability, after consideration of
insurance recovery, would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.

In October 2000, Kelsey-Hayes Company (formerly known as Fruehauf Corporation) was served with
a grand jury subpoena relating to a criminal investigation being conducted by the U.S. Attorney for
the Southern District of Illinois. The U.S. Attorney has informed the Company that the investigation
relates to possible wrongdoing by Kelsey-Hayes Company and others involving certain loans made
by Kelsey-Hayes Company’s then parent corporation to Fruehauf Trailer Corporation, the handling of
the trailing liabilities of Fruehauf Corporation and actions in connection with the 1996 bankruptcy of
Fruehauf Trailer Corporation.

Kelsey-Hayes Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of TRW upon TRW’s acquisition of Lucas
Varity in 1999. The Company is cooperating with the investigation and is unable to predict the
outcome of the investigation at this time.

On May 6, 2002, ArvinMeritor Inc. filed suit against TRW in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Michigan, claiming breach of contract and breach of warranty in connection with
certain tie rod ends that TRW supplied to ArvinMeritor and the voluntary recall of some of these tie
rod ends. ArvinMeritor subsequently recalled all of the tie rod ends, and claims that it is entitled to
reimbursement from TRW for the costs associated with both the products recalled by TRW and those
recalled by ArvinMeritor on its own. ArvinMeritor is seeking $18.3 million in damages plus legal fees,
administrative expenses and interest. Management believes that the Company has meritorious
defenses and intends to defend vigorously the claims asserted against the Company, but cannot
predict the outcome of this lawsuit.

On October 1, 2002, International Truck & Engine Corporation notified the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, or NHTSA, of a program to affect a voluntary safety recall of hydraulic anti-lock
brake systems electronic control units manufactured by Kelsey-Hayes Company. On October 1, 2002,
International Truck’s parent company filed a current report on Form 8-K in which it disclosed that it
seeks to recover costs associated with its voluntary recall from the manufacturer of the electronic
control units and indicated that it expects to record a pre-tax charge of approximately $51 million for
estimated recall costs. On October 3, 2002, Kelsey-Hayes Company filed a declaratory judgment
action against International Truck in the Circuit Court for the County of Oakland, Michigan seeking a
judgment declaring that International Truck has no right to recover any of the costs associated with
the voluntary recall. On November 22, 2002, International Truck filed an answer and counterclaim.
On December 20, 2002, Kelsey-Hayes Company filed an answer to the counterclaims of International

Truck & Engine Corporation. The parties reached an agreement to settle this dispute on
September 10, 2003 and the settlement does not have a material effect on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

On December 30, 2002, Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. and Koyo Delaware, Inc. filed a complaint against
TRW and its then wholly-owned subsidiary, TRW Automotive Holding Company, in the Circuit Court
for Monroe County, Tennessee, alleging that TRW violated certain nonassignment and other
provisions of a 1988 partnership agreement with Koyo, under which the parties formed TKS, by
agreeing to be merged into Northrop and by cooperating with Northrop in preparing for the spin-off of
TRW’s automotive business or the sale of that business to BCP Acquisition Company L.L.C., an
entity controlled by Blackstone. The complaint included claims for breach of contract, breach of
fiduciary duty and breach of good faith and fair dealing. It sought declaratory relief consisting of an
injunction prohibiting the defendants from including the partnership interest held by TRW Automotive
Holding Company in any sale or transfer to Blackstone and from disclosing Koyo trade secrets to
third parties, orders terminating defendants’ participation in the partnership and requiring defendants
to sell their partnership interest to Koyo and damages. On January 21, 2003, TRW and TRW
Automotive Holding Company filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. On February 21,
2003, the Circuit Court for Monroe County, Tennessee, issued a temporary injunction prohibiting the
sale to any entity controlled by Blackstone, of the partnership interest held by TRW Automotive
Holding Company, in TKS, pending the final hearing of the matter. On March 7, 2003, Koyo Seiko
filed a cross motion for partial summary judgment seeking a permanent injunction and other relief.
On July 30, 2003, the court issued an order, which enjoined TRW and its subsidiaries and affiliates
from: (i) selling or transferring all or any part of its partnership interest in TKS to Blackstone; (ii)
assigning all or part of its rights under the TKS Partnership Agreement to Blackstone; and (iii)
delegating all or part of its obligations under the TKS Partnership Agreement to Blackstone. The
Company has been informed that Northrop has reached an agreement with Koyo Seiko to sell the
51% interest in TKS to Koyo Seiko.

While certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have been subject in recent years to asbestos-related
claims, management believes that such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition or results of operations. In general, these claims seek damages for
illnesses alleged to have resulted from exposure to asbestos used in certain components sold by the
Company’s subsidiaries. Management believes that the majority of the claimants were assembly
workers at the major U.S. automobile manufacturers.

The vast majority of these claims name as defendants numerous manufacturers and suppliers of a
wide variety of products allegedly containing asbestos. Management believes that, to the extent any
of the products sold by these subsidiaries and at issue in these cases contained asbestos, the
asbestos was encapsulated. Based upon several years of experience with such claims, management
believes that only a small proportion of the claimants has or will ever develop any asbestos-related
impairment.

Neither settlement costs in connection with asbestos claims nor average annual legal fees to defend
these claims have been material in the past. These claims are strongly disputed by the Company and
its subsidiaries and it has been the policy to defend against them aggressively. Many of these cases
have been dismissed without any payment whatsoever. Moreover, there is significant insurance
coverage with solvent carriers with respect to these claims. However, while the Company’s costs to
defend and settle these claims in the past have not been material, there can be no assurances that
this will remain so in the future.

Management believes that the ultimate resolution of the foregoing matters will not have a material
effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements

**1.** **Description of business and change in ownership**

**_Description of business_**

TRW Automotive Inc. (also referred to herein as the ‘‘Company’’) is among the world’s largest and
most diversified suppliers of automotive systems, modules and components to global automotive
vehicle manufacturers, or VMs, and related aftermarkets. The Company conducts substantially all of
its operations through subsidiaries. These operations primarily encompass the design, manufacture
and sale of active and passive safety related products. Active safety related products primarily refer
to vehicle dynamic controls (primarily braking and steering), and passive safety related products
principally refer to occupant restraints (primarily air bags and seat belts) and crash sensors. The
Company is primarily a ‘‘Tier-1’’ supplier (a supplier which sells directly to VMs), with over 85% of its
sales in 2002 made directly to VMs.

**_Change in ownership_**

On February 28, 2003, an entity controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (‘‘Blackstone’’),
through a newly-formed entity TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. (‘‘Holdings’’), caused its indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary, TRW Automotive Acquisition Corp., to purchase substantially all of the
assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities (other than certain indebtedness) associated with
TRW Inc.’s automotive business from Northrop Grumman Corporation (‘‘Northrop’’) for a purchase
price of $4,443 million (excluding assumed debt of $210 million), subject to certain closing and
post-closing adjustments (the ‘‘Acquisition’’). Previously, on December 11, 2002, Northrop
consummated an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ‘‘Merger’’) with TRW Inc. (‘‘TRW’’) whereby
Northrop acquired all of the outstanding common stock of TRW, including TRW’s automotive
business, in exchange for Northrop’s shares. Subsequent to the Acquisition, TRW Automotive
Acquisition Corp. changed it’s name to TRW Automotive Inc. (referred to herein as the ‘‘Company’’ or
the ‘‘Successor’’). Upon completion of the Acquisition, a subsidiary of Northrop retained a 19.6%
interest in Holdings.

Holdings was capitalized by a cash equity contribution of $698 million (further described below) and
contributed the $698 million in cash plus newly issued shares of its common stock having an implied
value of $170 million to TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings Corp. (‘‘Intermediate’’) which is the
direct parent of the Company. Intermediate issued a $600 million face amount subordinated 8%
pay-in-kind note due 2018 (the ‘‘Seller Note’’) to an affiliate of Northrop to acquire the stock of certain
TRW automotive subsidiaries. Intermediate contributed such stock together with a cash equity
contribution of $698 million and the $170 million of Holdings common stock to the Company for
100% of the Company’s stock. Intermediate has no independent operations or investments other than
its investment in the Company. Intermediate will be dependent on the cash flows of the Company to
repay the Seller Note upon maturity.

In connection with the Acquisition, the Company issued senior notes (the ‘‘Senior Notes’’) and senior
subordinated notes (the ‘‘Senior Subordinated Notes’’) in a private offering, entered into new
revolving credit and term loan facilities (the ‘‘Senior Secured Credit Facilities’’) and initiated a trade
accounts receivable securitization program (the ‘‘Receivables Facility’’).

Funding for the cash portion of the purchase price of the Acquisition included $1,577 million in
proceeds from the notes, $1,510 million in borrowings under the Company’s Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, and a cash equity contribution primarily from affiliates of Blackstone, in exchange for
shares of Holdings. Employees of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries also made cash equity
contributions in exchange for shares of Holdings. In connection with the Acquisition, the Company
incurred approximately $56 million in costs which have been capitalized and included as part of the
purchase price.

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements (continued)

On December 30, 2002, Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. and Koyo Delaware, Inc. filed a complaint against
TRW and its then wholly-owned subsidiary, TRW Automotive Holding Company, in the Circuit Court
for Monroe County, Tennessee, alleging that TRW violated certain provisions of the partnership
agreement with Koyo under which the parties formed TRW Koyo Steering Systems Company
(‘‘TKS’’). On February 21, 2003, the Circuit Court for Monroe County, Tennessee, issued a temporary
injunction prohibiting the sale to any entity controlled by Blackstone, of the partnership interest held
by TRW Automotive Holding Company in TKS, pending the final hearing of the matter. On March 7,
2003, Koyo Seiko filed a cross motion for partial summary judgment seeking a permanent injunction
and other relief. On July 30, 2003, the court issued an order, which enjoined TRW and its
subsidiaries and affiliates from: (i) selling or transferring all or any part of its partnership interest in
TKS to Blackstone; (ii) assigning all or part of its rights under the TKS Partnership Agreement to
Blackstone; and (iii) delegating all or part of its obligations under the TKS Partnership Agreement to
Blackstone. The Company has been informed that Northrop has reached an agreement with Koyo
Seiko to sell the 51% interest in TKS to Koyo Seiko.

The following unaudited pro forma financial data summarizes the results of operations for the six
months ended June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002 as if the Acquisition had occurred as of January 1
of each period. Pro forma adjustments include the removal of the results of operations of TKS,
elimination of a $42 million inventory write-up recorded as a result of the Acquisition, elimination of
$85 million in purchased in-process research and development expense, adjustments to depreciation
and amortization to reflect fair value of property, plant equipment and intangibles, the elimination of
the amortization of unrecognized pension and other post retirement benefit losses, adjustments to
corporate allocations to reflect estimated stand-alone costs, adjustments to interest expense to reflect
the Company’s new capital structure, adjustments to loss on sale of receivables to reflect the
initiation of the Receivables Facility and certain adjustments to income taxes. These pro forma
amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been attained if the Acquisition
had occurred at the beginning of each period presented or that may be attained in the future.

**2.** **Basis of presentation**

The following provides a description of the basis of presentation during all periods presented:

_Successor – Represents the consolidated financial position of the Company as of June 27,_
2003 and consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the four months ended June 27,
2003 following the Acquisition. The financial position as of June 27, 2003 and results of
operations and cash flows for the four months ended June 27, 2003 reflect the preliminary
application of purchase accounting, relating to the Acquisition as described more fully below.

_Predecessor – Represents the combined financial position of the automotive business of TRW_
for all periods prior to the Acquisition on February 28, 2003. This presentation reflects the
historical basis of accounting without the application of purchase accounting for the Merger in
any period presented.

F-47


-----

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements (continued)

The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Successor exclude, while the
Predecessor includes, for all periods presented, the financial position, results of operations and
cash flows of TKS.

The consolidated and combined statements of operations include expenses recorded by the
Predecessor or directly charged to the Predecessor by TRW for periods prior to the Merger and by
Northrop for periods prior to the Acquisition. In addition, the statements of operations include an
allocation of general and administrative corporate expenses from TRW and Northrop to reflect the
services provided to the Predecessor or benefits received by the Predecessor. These services
primarily consisted of general corporate management and governance, finance and accounting,
treasury and risk management, human resources and benefits administration, legal, management
information services and other shared support services. The TRW allocation was $41 million for the
six months ended June 28, 2002. The Northrop allocation was $8 million for the two months ended
February 28, 2003. The allocations are reported in administrative and selling expenses in the
consolidated and combined statements of operations. These allocations were computed using TRW’s
and Northrop’s internal allocation methodology, which was based upon an established percentage of
costs applied to the cost of operations (sales less earnings (losses) before taxes from continuing
operations). The allocation to the Company represented a pro-rata share of such expenses, based on
the ratio of its cost of operations (as defined above) to TRW’s total cost of operations (excluding
allocable corporate expenses). Given that TRW and Northrop Grumman provided such support
services for the benefit of their entire organizations, it would have been impractical to allocate such
expenses in a more direct manner. Accordingly, management believes that this was a reasonable
method for allocating such expenses. However, as the scale of operations and nature of the business
of TRW differed from that of the Company, these allocations are not necessarily representative of the
operating expenses that would have been incurred had the Predecessor operated on a stand-alone
basis.

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Successor and unaudited
combined financial statements of the Predecessor have been prepared pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’) for interim financial
information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (‘‘GAAP’’) for complete financial
statements. These financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of
operations of the Company. Operating results for the four months ended June 27, 2003 of the
Successor are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2003.

The unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the four months
ended June 27, 2003 reflect the Acquisition under the purchase method of accounting, in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (‘‘SFAS’’) 141, ‘‘Business Combinations.’’ Purchase
price allocation has been prepared on a preliminary basis, and reasonable changes are expected as
additional information becomes available.

The purchase price of approximately $4.4 billion was allocated as follows:

Net tangible assets acquired of $817 million include the valuation of the Company’s projected
pension, post-retirement and post-employment benefit obligations and assets. These valuations are in
process, and estimates have been reflected in the current allocation of purchase price at the
projected benefit obligation less plan assets at fair market value, based on preliminary actuarial
computations of independent appraisers engaged by the Company. Deferred income taxes have
been provided in the consolidated balance sheet based on the Company’s best estimates of the tax
vs. book basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as adjusted to estimated fair values.
Valuation allowances have been established against those assets for which realization is not likely,
namely in the U.S. and U.K., as losses are currently being generated in those tax jurisdictions. Net
tangible assets include the effect of fair value adjustments to net property, plant and equipment
based on preliminary work performed by independent appraisers, and inventory and debt outstanding
as of the effective date of the Acquisition based on management’s judgements and estimates. The
Company also recorded a $37 million reserve, primarily for severance related to strategic
restructurings, plant closings and involuntary employee termination arrangements outside the U.S. to
be paid over the next several years in accordance with local law. The Company is continuing to
evaluate its restructuring plans and additional adjustments to the preliminary purchase price
allocation may be required in subsequent periods.

The Company has also engaged independent appraisers to provide fair values of intangible assets
acquired, including purchased in-process research and development, trademarks, developed
technology and customer relationships.

The Company has recorded a one-time charge for purchased in-process research and development
(‘‘Purchased IPR&D’’) expenses of $85 million. The value of Purchased IPR&D was comprised of 21
ongoing development projects, which ranged from 5% to 95% complete at the Acquisition date.
Purchased IPR&D was derived by assigning values to those projects identified by management as
having economic value, but that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative
future use. These products had not been released to the market as of the date of the Acquisition, but
the features and functionality of the products had been defined.

Developed technology and trademarks were valued based on the relief of royalty approach. This
method allocates value based on what the Company would be willing to pay as a royalty to a
third-party owner of the technology or trademark in order to exploit the economic benefits. The
technologies that have been valued under this approach are innovative and technological
advancements within the safety business. A total value of $79 million has been allocated to
developed technologies and will be amortized over 8 years. The trademarks have been valued at
$292 million and assigned an indefinite life.

F-49


-----

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements (continued)

Customer relationships were valued using an excess earnings approach after considering a fair
return on fixed assets, working capital, technology, assembled workforce and internally generated
cost reductions. A value of $117 million has been assigned to customer relationships and will be
amortized over 20 years.

Management believes that the carrying values of all other assets acquired and liabilities assumed
approximate their fair values.

The resulting goodwill after all identifiable intangible assets have been valued was approximately
$3.1 billion. Goodwill and trademarks will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with
SFAS 142.

The unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the four months ended June 27, 2003
includes $42 million in cost of sales representing the write-off of the inventory adjustment recorded in
purchase accounting relating to the sale of inventory on hand as of the Acquisition date that was sold
during this period, depreciation adjustments correlating to the fair value adjustments to property, plant
and equipment, amortization of identified intangible assets and fair value adjustments to assumed
debt obligations, among other changes resulting from the application of purchase accounting.

The amounts that the Company may record based on the final assessment and determination of fair
values may differ from the information presented in the unaudited consolidated balance sheet and
statement of operations. Amounts allocated to net tangible assets and intangible assets may be
revised, and useful lives may differ from those used in these financial statements, any of which could
result in a change in depreciation and amortization expense.

The combined balance sheet of the Predecessor as of December 31, 2002 reflects the historical
basis of accounting for the Predecessor and does not reflect the push down of purchase accounting
resulting from the Merger. The unaudited combined statement of operations for the six months ended
June 28, 2002 reflects the results of the Predecessor on their historical basis of accounting.

These unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited
combined financial statements and accompanying notes of the Predecessor as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2002.

**3.** **Significant accounting policies**

The Company is continuing to evaluate its accounting policies, but has generally adopted the
accounting policies of the Predecessor. These accounting policies are subject to change as this
analysis is completed. Several significant accounting policies adopted by the Successor have been
detailed further below.

**_Use of estimates._** The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities (including fair value adjustments made to date in accounting for the Acquisition – see Note
2 above), disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts in the combined
statements of operations. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.

**_Long-lived assets._** Appraisals are currently in process for property, plant and equipment,
identifiable intangibles, in-process research and development and goodwill (see Note 2 above).

**_Debt issuance costs._** Approximately $110 million of costs incurred with the issuance of the
Company’s new Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Senior Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes have
been capitalized and are being amortized over the lives of the related indebtedness ranging from
periods of 6 to 10 years. In connection with the July 2003 refinancing of certain portions of this debt,
the Company expects to write-off approximately $30 million of these costs in the fiscal quarter ending
September 26, 2003 (see Note 12 below).

F-50


-----

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements (continued)

**_Accounts receivable securitization._** The Receivables Facility (which is further described in Note
13) can be treated as a general financing agreement or as an off balance sheet financing
arrangement. Whether the funding and related receivables are shown as liabilities and assets,
respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, or conversely, are removed from the
consolidated balance sheet, depends on the level of the multi-seller conduits’ loans to the Borrower.
When such level is at least 10% of the fair value of all of the Borrower’s assets (consisting principally
of receivables sold by the Sellers), the securitization transactions are accounted for as a sale of the
receivables under the provisions of SFAS 140, ‘‘Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial
Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,’’ and are removed from the consolidated balance sheet.
Costs associated with the Receivables Facility are recorded as loss on sale of receivables in the
Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The book value of the Company’s retained interest
in the receivables approximates fair market value due to the current nature of the receivables.
However, at such time as the fair value of the multi-seller commercial paper conduits’ loans are less
than 10% of the fair value of all of the Borrower’s assets, the Company is required to consolidate the
Borrower, resulting in the funding and related receivables being shown as liabilities and assets,
respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and the costs associated with the
receivables facility being recorded as interest expense.

**_Income taxes._** The Company’s results of operations for the four months ended June 27, 2003 will
be included in the consolidated income tax returns filed by Holdings for the tax year ending
December 31, 2003. Income tax expense in the Company’s consolidated and combined statements
of operations was calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109, ‘‘Accounting for Income Taxes’’, on a
separate-return basis, as if the Company had operated as a stand-alone entity in all periods
presented. The Predecessor’s operations through February 28, 2003 will be included in the
consolidated income tax returns filed by Northrop (see Notes 1 and 2 above and Note 14 below).

**_Accounting for stock-based compensation._** At December 31, 2002 and February 28, 2003,
Northrop has issued certain stock options to certain Predecessor employees that are described more
fully in Note 19 to the 2002 financial statements. Each of these options are for shares of Northrop.

Since the Acquisition, Holdings has issued approximately 86,000 options in Holdings’ common stock
to certain Company employees. These options have a 10 year life, vest 20% per year over 5 years,
and have the following exercise prices: 50% equal to fair value of the underlying stock on the date of
grant, 40% equal to 2 times the fair value on the date of grant and 10% equal to 3 times the fair
value on the date of grant.

The Company applies the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, ‘‘Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees’’, and related Interpretations in
accounting for those plans. No stock-based employee compensation expense has been reflected in
net income as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to or greater than
the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.

**_Warranties._** The Company records product warranty liabilities based upon management estimates
including such factors as the written agreement between the Company and the customer, the length
of the warranty period, the historical performance of the product and likely changes in performance of
newer products and the mix and volume of products sold. The liability is reviewed on a regular basis
and adjusted to reflect actual experience.

The following table presents the movement in the product warranty liability for the two months ended
February 28, 2003 and the four months ended June 27, 2003:

Apart from product warranties, the Company also incurs recall costs when it or the customer decide
to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known
or suspected safety concern.

**4.** **Recent accounting pronouncements**

SFAS 143, ‘‘Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,’’ requires the fair value of a liability for
asset retirement obligations to be recorded in the period in which it is incurred. The statement applies
to a company’s legal or contractual obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived
asset that resulted from the acquisition, construction or development or through the normal operation
of a long-lived asset. The Predecessor adopted SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and the adoption did
not have a material impact on the combined financial statements.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 145, ‘‘Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections.’’ SFAS 145 requires gains and
losses on extinguishments of debt to be reclassified as income or loss from continuing operations
rather than as extraordinary items as previously required by SFAS 4, ‘‘Reporting Gains and Losses
from Extinguishment of Debt.’’ SFAS 145 also amends SFAS 13 requiring certain modifications to
capital leases to be treated as sale-leaseback transactions and to subleases when the original lessee
remains a secondary obligor, or guarantor.

The Predecessor adopted the provisions of SFAS 145 related to the rescission of SFAS 4 on January
1, 2003. In the first quarter of 2002, the Predecessor completed an unsolicited repurchase of £5.4

F-52


-----

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements (continued)

million (approximately $8 million) of the 10.875% debentures issued by a subsidiary due 2020. The
repurchase resulted in an extraordinary gain of $4 million before taxes and $2 million after taxes. The
extraordinary gain recorded for the extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2002 has been
reclassified into earnings in the accompanying financial statements. The remaining provisions of
SFAS 145 were effective for transactions and reporting subsequent to May 15, 2002 and were
adopted by the Predecessor as of that date. The adoption of these provisions did not have a material
impact on the Predecessor’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, ‘‘Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities.’’ SFAS 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with exit or disposal activities be
recognized when the liability is incurred rather than when an entity commits to an exit plan. SFAS
146 also provides that the liability be initially measured at fair value. The Predecessor adopted SFAS
146 on January 1, 2003 and the adoption had no effect on the combined financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, ‘‘Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,’’
which expands the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees
such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the
company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that
guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. The initial
recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact
on the Predecessor’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, ‘‘Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,’’ which addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets,
liabilities and activities of another entity. Interpretation No. 46 requires consolidation of a variable
interest entity if the reporting entity is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest
entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the variable interest entity’s residual returns or
both. The consolidation requirements of Interpretation No. 46 apply immediately to variable interest
entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the
first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain disclosure requirements apply
in all financial statements initially issued after January 31, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Predecessor’s nor the Company’s financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, ‘‘Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities’’ (‘‘SFAS 149’’). SFAS 149 requires that contracts with comparable
characteristics be accounted for similarly, and is effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003, as well as for hedging relationships designated after that date. The Company will
adopt SFAS 149 as of the beginning of the fiscal quarter ending September 26, 2003, and does not
expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its reported financial position of
results of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, ‘‘Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.’’ SFAS 150 clarifies the accounting for certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires that these instruments be
classified as liabilities in statements of financial position. Previously, many of these financial
instruments were classified as equity. SFAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003 and the other provisions are effective at the beginning of the first interim
period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 had no impact on the Successor’s
financial position.

**5.** **Acquisitions and divestitures**

On April 8, 2003, the Company sold its 21.8% equity interest in TOYODA TRW Automotive, Inc.
(‘‘Toyoda’’) to its joint venture partner, Toyoda Machine Works, Ltd. The Company had previously
accounted for its interest in Toyoda under the equity method, and classified this investment in ‘‘Other
assets’’ (long-term) in its combined and consolidated balance sheets. On June 27, 2003, the
Company sold its 60% partnership interest in Quality Safety Systems Company (‘‘QSS’’), a Canadian
seatbelt joint venture, to a subsidiary of its partner, Tokai Rika Co., Ltd. Through the sale date, QSS’s
financial position and results of operations were included in the Company’s consolidated and
combined financial statements. Proceeds from these sales were approximately $31 million, net of
cash retained in the QSS business.

On June 26, 2003, the Company acquired sole ownership of the immediate parent of Autocruise,
S.A. (‘‘Autocruise’’) by acquiring for nominal consideration the equity interest held by its former joint
venture partner, Thales Group. Autocruise, operating a custom-built facility in Brest, France, designs
and manufactures radar-based adaptive cruise control systems, principally sold in certain European
markets.

**6.** **Subsequent event**

On July 22, 2003, the Company refinanced $200 million of the borrowings under its term loan A
facility and all of the borrowings under its term loan B facilities with the proceeds of new term loan C
facilities (denominated in the amounts of $1.15 billion and t95 million) under its Senior Secured
Credit Facility, together with approximately $46 million of available cash on hand, as more fully
described in Note 12 below.

**7.** **Supplemental cash flow information**

A portion of the Acquisition purchase price was financed with non-cash consideration. As described in
Note 1, Intermediate issued the Seller Note to an affiliate of Northrop to acquire the stock of certain
TRW automotive subsidiaries. Intermediate contributed these acquired subsidiaries, with a deemed
fair value of $348 million, to the Company. Intermediate also contributed the $170 million of Holdings
common stock to the Company. The Company transferred these Holdings shares to a subsidiary of
Northrop as part of the purchase price. In addition, the purchase price included a preliminary
post-closing adjustment estimate recorded by the Company as short-term debt.

In connection with the Acquisition, the Company issued Senior Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes
in a private offering and entered into new Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In addition, the Company
assumed certain debt instruments existing at the Acquisition including 10.875% debentures
previously issued by Lucas Industries Limited (formerly known as Lucas Industries plc) due 2020 at
face amount of $149 million and a fair value at Acquisition of $167 million, and certain other
borrowings, including accrued interest, totaling approximately $60 million.

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements (continued)

The Senior Notes consist of $925 million, 9[3]⁄8% Senior Notes and t200 million, 10[1]⁄8% Senior Notes,
both due February 15, 2013. The Senior Subordinated Notes consist of $300 million, 11% Senior
Subordinated Notes and t125 million, 11[3]⁄4% Senior Subordinated Notes, both due February 15,
2013. Interest is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 with the first payment due
August 15, 2003. The Senior Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis and
the Senior Subordinated Notes are guaranteed on a senior subordinated unsecured basis, in each
case by substantially all existing and future wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and by TRW
Automotive Finance (Luxembourg) S.à.r.l. (‘‘TRW Luxembourg’’), a restricted Luxembourg subsidiary.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities consist of a secured revolving credit facility and various senior
secured term loan facilities. The six-year revolving credit facility, through a syndication of banks,
provides for borrowings up to $500 million including the availability of letters of credit, a portion of
which is available in various foreign currencies and bears interest at a rate equal to an applicable
margin plus, at the Company’s option, either a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of
1) the prime rate or 2) the federal funds rate plus 1/2% or b) LIBOR or a eurocurrency rate
determined by reference to the costs of funds for deposits in the currency of such borrowing for the
interest period relevant to such borrowing, each as adjusted for an applicable margin ranging from
1[1]⁄4% to 4[3]⁄4% depending on the type of borrowing and the leverage ratio of the Company, as defined
in the agreement. Interest is generally due quarterly in arrears, and is also due upon the expiration of
any particular loan. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the undrawn
portion of the revolving commitments at a rate equal to 3/4% per annum (which may be reduced
under certain circumstances), and customary letter of credit fees. The six-year term loan tranche A
was issued in a face amount of $410 million while eight-year term loans tranche B were issued in a
face amount of $1,030 million plus approximately t65 million.

The term loans generally bear interest at the same rates as the revolving credit facility. The Senior
Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Holdings and
subject to certain exceptions, each existing and future domestic subsidiary of Holdings (other than
the Company’s receivables subsidiaries), including intermediate, and guaranteed by TRW
Luxembourg. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all the
assets of the Company and pledges of the capital stock of the majority of the domestic and foreign
subsidiaries.

On July 22, 2003, the Company refinanced $200 million of the borrowings under its term loan A
facility and all of the borrowings under its term loan B facilities with the proceeds of new term loan C
facilities (denominated in the amounts of $1.15 billion and t95 million) under its Senior Secured
Credit Facility, bearing interest at 4.13% and 5.10625% per annum, respectively. The net proceeds
from these borrowings, together with approximately $46 million of available cash on hand, were used
to refinance all of the outstanding tranche B loans and $200 million of the tranche A term loan
previously borrowed under this facility. The refinanced term loan A and term loan B debt had a
weighted average stated interest of approximately 5.3% per annum and, as a result of this
refinancing, the Company expects to realize an annual reduction in its cash interest expense of
approximately $10 million.

The term loans amortize each year generally in equal quarterly amounts (or in the case of the period
after December 31, 2009 with respect to term loan C facilities, in quarterly amounts until the maturity
date) in the following approximate aggregate principal amounts (in millions) for each year set forth

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Senior Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes contain a
number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the
Company and its subsidiaries, to sell assets, incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock,
repay other indebtedness (including the Senior Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes), pay certain
dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock, create liens on assets, make investments,
loans or advances, make certain acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations, enter into sale
and leaseback transactions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, amend certain material
agreements governing the Company’s indebtedness, including the Senior Notes and Senior
Subordinated Notes and the Receivables Facility and change the business conducted by the
Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain the following
financial covenants: a maximum total leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, and a
maximum capital expenditures limitation and require certain prepayments from excess cash flows, as
defined.

As of June 27, 2003, the Company had approximately $51 million in outstanding letters of credit
none of which had been drawn against.

Short term debt at June 27, 2003 includes a short-term note payable to Northrop reflecting certain
estimated post-closing adjustments, subject to final negotiation. The obligation accrues interest at
LIBOR and is payable after the final determination of the purchase price is agreed.

**13.** **Accounts receivable securitization**

The Receivables Facility provides up to $600 million in funding. On February 28, 2003, certain
subsidiaries of the Company (the ‘‘Sellers’’) signed a Receivables Purchase Agreement and began
selling trade accounts receivable (the ‘‘Receivables’’) originated by them and certain of their
subsidiaries as sellers in the United States through the Receivables Facility. Receivables are sold to
TRW Automotive Receivables LLC (the ‘‘Transferor’’) at a discount. The Transferor is a bankruptcy
remote special purpose limited liability company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
The Transferor’s purchase of Receivables is financed through a transfer agreement with TRW
Automotive Global Receivables LLC (‘‘Borrower’’). Under the terms of the Transfer Agreement, the
Borrower purchases all Receivables sold to the Transferor. The Borrower is a bankruptcy remote
qualifying special purpose limited liability company that is wholly owned by the Transferor and is not
consolidated when certain requirements are met as further described in Note 3.

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements (continued)

Multi-seller commercial paper conduits, supported by committed liquidity facilities, are available to
provide cash funding for the Borrowers’ purchase of Receivables through secured loans/tranches to
the extent desired and permitted under the receivables loan agreement. A note is issued for the
difference between Receivables purchased and cash borrowed through the facility. The Sellers act as
servicing agents per the servicing agreement and continue to service the transferred receivables for
which they receive a monthly servicing fee at a rate of 1% per annum. The usage fee under the
Receivables Facility is 1.50%. In addition, the Company is required to pay a fee of 0.50% on the
unused portion of the Receivables Facility. These rates are per annum and payments of these fees
are made to the Lenders monthly.

Availability of funding under the Receivables Facility depends primarily upon the outstanding trade
accounts receivable balance for the week as of Friday of the previous week. This balance is reported
no later than the third business day of the subsequent week to the lenders. Availability is determined
by reducing the receivables balance by outstanding borrowings under the program, the historical rate
of collection on those receivables and other characteristics of those receivables that affect their
eligibility (such as bankruptcy or downgrading below investment grade of the obligor, delinquency and
excessive concentration). Based on the terms of this facility and the criteria described above,
approximately $433 million of the Company’s accounts receivable balance as of June 27, 2003 was
considered eligible for borrowings under this facility, of which approximately $360 million would have
been available for funding. At the date of initial funding, the Company securitized $150 million in
receivables. In addition, during the four months ended June 27, 2003, the Company securitized $70
million in receivables. As these amounts were collected from customers and there were no
borrowings outstanding under the receivables facility on June 27, 2003, the fair value of the
multi-seller conduits’ loans was less than 10% of the fair value of the borrower’s assets and,
therefore, the financial statements of the borrower were included in our consolidated financial
statements as of June 27, 2003.

Prior to the Merger, TRW had a $350 million accounts receivable securitization agreement, later
reduced to $325 million, with a financial institution and several financial conduits. TRW established a
wholly-owned, fully-consolidated, bankruptcy-remote, special purpose subsidiary, TRW Receivables
Inc., which is included in the combined historical financial statements of the Predecessor, for the
purpose of purchasing accounts receivable of TRW and the Predecessor, including receivables
purchased by TRW from certain of its and the Predecessor’s subsidiaries, and selling an undivided
interest in the receivables to the financial conduits. The agreement provided that collection of
receivables were to be reinvested in new accounts receivable. In accordance with the agreement,
TRW serviced and collected the receivables on behalf of the financial conduits. The conduits and the
special purpose subsidiary had no recourse to other assets of the Predecessor or of TRW for failure
of debtors to pay when due. For the six months ended June 28, 2002, net cash proceeds from
account receivables securitized was $32 million. This accounts receivable securitization program was
terminated in December 2002.

The Company does not own any variable interests in the multi-seller conduits, as that term is defined
in FIN 46, ‘‘Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.’’

**14.** **Income taxes**

For the four months ended June 27, 2003, the Company recorded income tax expense using an
effective tax rate of 61% on earnings from operations before income taxes, excluding the charge for
purchased in-process research and development. In accordance with EITF Issue No. 96-7,
‘‘Accounting for Deferred Taxes on In-Process Research and Development Activities Acquired in a
Purchase Business Combination’’, no tax benefit was recorded on the write-off of purchased
in-process research and development. This effective tax rate is based on current projections for
earnings and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company does business and will be subject

F-59


-----

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements (continued)

to tax for the fiscal period ending December 31, 2003, and takes into consideration the effect of
purchase accounting adjustments recorded to date. The effective rate is substantially higher than the
U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of current losses in the U.S. The Company has
recorded a valuation allowance against the current benefits for such losses in its tax provision. The
estimated effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 is subject to change, pending final purchase accounting
adjustments, changes in estimated earnings and losses for the fiscal period and the mix of such
earnings and losses in different tax jurisdictions.

For the six months ended June 28, 2002 and the two months ended February 28, 2003, the
unaudited combined statements of earnings include an allocation to the Predecessor of TRW’s and
Northrop’s income taxes (credits), respectively, in amounts generally equivalent to the provisions that
would have resulted had these entities filed separate income tax returns for the periods presented.

**15.** **Financial instruments**

In connection with the Receivables Facility, the Company entered into certain credit default swaps
designed to protect the Company and the conduit lenders in the event of changes in the credit
ratings of certain of the Company’s significant customers. The changes in the fair value of the credit
default swaps, which have a 6-year life, are recorded through earnings (losses) as part of loss on
sale of receivables each reporting period. Fees associated with the origination of the credit default
swaps have been deferred and are being amortized over the life of the swaps.

**17.** **Capital stock**

The Company was incorporated in Delaware on November 27, 2002 with a capitalization of 100
shares of $0.01 par value common stock authorized. In connection with the Acquisition, 100 shares
were issued to Intermediate on February 28, 2003.

**18.** **Related party transactions**

As part of the Acquisition, the Company executed a Transaction and Monitoring Fee Agreement with
Blackstone whereby Blackstone agreed to provide the Company monitoring, advisory and consulting
services, including advice regarding (i) structure, terms and negotiation of debt and equity offerings;
(ii) relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries’ lenders and bankers; (iii) corporate strategy;
(iv) acquisitions or disposals and (v) other financial advisory services as more fully described in the
agreement. The Company has agreed to pay an annual monitoring fee of $5 million for these
services, approximately $2 million of which is included in the unaudited consolidated statement of
operations for the four months ended June 27, 2003.

The combined statements of operations include $41 million of administrative and selling expenses
and $131 million of interest expense allocated from TRW for the six months ended June 28, 2002
and $8 million of administrative and selling expenses and $43 million of interest expense allocated
from Northrop for the two months ended February 28, 2003 (see Note 2 to the unaudited combined
and consolidated interim financial statements and Note 3 to the audited combined financial
statements).

**19.** **Contingencies**

Various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings are pending or threatened against the
Company or its subsidiaries, covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its
business activities with respect to commercial, product liability and environmental matters. In addition,
the Company and its subsidiaries are conducting a number of environmental investigations and
remedial actions at current and former locations of certain of the Company’s subsidiares. Along with
other companies, certain subsidiaries of the Company have been named potentially responsible
parties for certain waste management sites. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties,
and some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably with respect to the Company or the relevant
subsidiary. A reserve estimate for each environmental matter is established using standard
engineering cost estimating techniques on an undiscounted basis. In the determination of such costs,
consideration is given to the professional judgment of Company environmental engineers, in
consultation with outside environmental specialists, when necessary. At multi-party sites, the reserve
estimate also reflects the expected allocation of total project costs among the various potentially

F-61


-----

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements (continued)

responsible parties. At June 27, 2003, the Company had reserves for environmental matters of $101
million. The Company believes any liability that may result from the resolution of environmental
matters for which sufficient information is available to support these cost estimates will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. However, the
Company cannot predict the effect on the Company’s financial position of expenditures for aspects of
certain matters for which there is insufficient information. In addition, the Company cannot predict the
effect of compliance with environmental laws and regulations with respect to unknown environmental
matters on the Company’s financial position or results of operations or the possible effect of
compliance with environmental requirements imposed in the future.

Further, product liability claims may be asserted in the future for events not currently known by
management. Although the ultimate liability from these potential claims cannot be ascertained at
December 31, 2002, management does not anticipate that any related liability, after consideration of
insurance recovery, would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.

In October 2000, Kelsey-Hayes Company (formerly known as Fruehauf Corporation) was served with
a grand jury subpoena relating to a criminal investigation being conducted by the U.S. Attorney for
the Southern District of Illinois. The U.S. Attorney has informed the Company that the investigation
relates to possible wrongdoing by Kelsey-Hayes Company and others involving certain loans made
by Kelsey-Hayes Company’s then parent corporation to Fruehauf Trailer Corporation, the handling of
the trailing liabilities of Fruehauf Corporation and actions in connection with the 1996 bankruptcy of
Fruehauf Trailer Corporation.

Kelsey-Hayes Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of TRW upon TRW’s acquisition of Lucas
Varity in 1999 and became a subsidiary of the Company upon the Acquisition. The Company has
cooperated with the investigation and is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation at this
time.

On May 6, 2002, ArvinMeritor Inc. filed suit against TRW in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Michigan, claiming breach of contract and breach of warranty in connection with
certain tie rod ends that TRW supplied to ArvinMeritor and the voluntary recall of some of these tie
rod ends. ArvinMeritor subsequently recalled all of the tie rod ends, and claims that it is entitled to
reimbursement from TRW for the costs associated with both the products recalled by TRW and those
recalled by ArvinMeritor on its own. ArvinMeritor is seeking $18.3 million in damages plus legal fees,
administrative expenses and interest. Management believes that the Company has meritorious
defenses and intends to defend vigorously the claims asserted against the Company, but cannot
predict the outcome of this lawsuit.

On October 1, 2002, International Truck & Engine Corporation notified the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, or NHTSA, of a program to affect a voluntary safety recall of hydraulic anti-lock
brake systems electronic control units manufactured by Kelsey-Hayes Company. On October 1, 2002,
International Truck’s parent company filed a current report on Form 8-K in which it disclosed that it
seeks to recover costs associated with its voluntary recall from the manufacturer of the electronic
control units and indicated that it expects to record a pre-tax charge of approximately $51 million for
estimated recall costs. On October 3, 2002, Kelsey-Hayes Company filed a declaratory judgment
action against International Truck in the Circuit Court for the County of Oakland, Michigan seeking a
judgment declaring that International Truck has no right to recover any of the costs associated with
the voluntary recall. On November 22, 2002, International Truck filed an answer and counterclaim.
On December 20, 2002, Kelsey-Hayes Company filed an answer to the counterclaims of International
Truck & Engine Corporation. The parties reached an agreement to settle this dispute on
September 10, 2003 and the settlement does not have a material effect on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

On December 30, 2002, Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. and Koyo Delaware, Inc. filed a complaint against
TRW and its then wholly-owned subsidiary, TRW Automotive Holding Company, in the Circuit Court
for Monroe County, Tennessee, alleging that TRW violated certain nonassignment and other
provisions of a 1988 partnership agreement with Koyo, under which the parties formed TKS, by
agreeing to be merged into Northrop and by cooperating with Northrop in preparing for the spin-off of
TRW’s automotive business or the sale of that business to BCP Acquisition Company L.L.C., an
entity controlled by Blackstone. The complaint included claims for breach of contract, breach of
fiduciary duty and breach of good faith and fair dealing. It sought declaratory relief consisting of an
injunction prohibiting the defendants from including the partnership interest held by TRW Automotive
Holding Company in any sale or transfer to Blackstone and from disclosing Koyo trade secrets to
third parties, orders terminating defendants’ participation in the partnership and requiring defendants
to sell their partnership interest to Koyo and damages. On January 21, 2003, TRW and TRW
Automotive Holding Company filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. On February 21,
2003, the Circuit Court for Monroe County, Tennessee, issued a temporary injunction prohibiting the
sale to any entity controlled by Blackstone, of the partnership interest held by TRW Automotive
Holding Company, in TKS, pending the final hearing of the matter. On March 7, 2003, Koyo Seiko
filed a cross motion for partial summary judgment seeking a permanent injunction and other relief.
On July 30, 2003, the court issued an order, which enjoined TRW and its subsidiaries and affiliates
from: (i) selling or transferring all or any part of its partnership interest in TKS to Blackstone;
(ii) assigning all or part of its rights under the TKS Partnership Agreement to Blackstone; and
(iii) delegating all or part of its obligations under the TKS Partnership Agreement to Blackstone. The
Company has been informed that Northrop has reached an agreement with Koyo Seiko to sell the
51% interest in TKS to Koyo Seiko.

While certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have been subject in recent years to asbestos-related
claims, management believes that such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition or results of operations. In general, these claims seek damages for
illnesses alleged to have resulted from exposure to asbestos used in certain components sold by the
Company’s subsidiaries. Management believes that the majority of the claimants were assembly
workers at the major U.S. automobile manufacturers.

The vast majority of these claims name as defendants numerous manufacturers and suppliers of a
wide variety of products allegedly containing asbestos. Management believes that, to the extent any
of the products sold by these subsidiaries and at issue in these cases contained asbestos, the
asbestos was encapsulated. Based upon several years of experience with such claims, management
believes that only a small proportion of the claimants has or will ever develop any asbestos-related
impairment.

Neither settlement costs in connection with asbestos claims nor average annual legal fees to defend
these claims have been material in the past. These claims are strongly disputed by the Company and
its subsidiaries and it has been the policy to defend against them aggressively. Many of these cases
have been dismissed without any payment whatsoever. Moreover, there is significant insurance
coverage with solvent carriers with respect to these claims. However, while costs to defend and settle
these claims in the past have not been material, there can be no assurances that this will remain so
in the future.

Management believes that the ultimate resolution of the foregoing matters will not have a material
effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

In connection with the Acquisition, TRW Automotive Inc. (presented as Parent in the following tables)
issued Senior Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes as further described in note 12 ‘‘Financing

#### TRW AUTOMOTIVE INC. Notes to unaudited combined and consolidated interim financial statements (continued)

arrangements’’. The Senior Notes are fully, unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed on an
unsecured senior basis and the Senior Subordinated Notes are fully, unconditionally and jointly and
severally guaranteed on an unsecured senior subordinated basis, in each case, by substantially all
existing and future wholly owned restricted domestic subsidiaries of TRW Automotive and by TRW
Luxembourg (collectively, the ‘‘Guarantors’’). All other subsidiaries of TRW Automotive, whether direct
or indirect, do not guarantee the Senior Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes (‘‘Non-Guarantors’’). At
this time, all existing wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of TRW Automotive are restricted domestic
subsidiaries. The Guarantors also unconditionally guarantee the Company’s borrowings under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities on a senior secured basis.

The following unaudited condensed combining financial statements present the results of operations,
financial position and cash flows of (1) the Parent, (2) the Guarantors, (3) the Non-Guarantors and
(4) eliminations to arrive at the information for TRW Automotive on a combined basis. Separate
financial statements and other disclosures concerning the Guarantors are not presented because
management does not believe that such information is material to investors.
